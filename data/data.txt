The first one has been running great for the last two years and I had no hesitation in buying another one for my dad. Unfortunately, I realized something was wrong with this watch the moment I took it out of the box. All Automatic watches need a couple of turns of the winder to get them started. The winder on this one offered no resistance what so ever. That in itself was a clue to a bigger problem. Once the watch gets an initial wind, it supposed to be able to wind itself as you move around. This watch stopped within 5 minutes. I wore it for two days, trying to give it enough wind to keep it going, but it still stopped 30 minutes after I took it off.\nSince the first watch was/is running flawlessly, it's safe to assume that this is simply lack of manufacturer's quality control.

Williams", "reviewText": "A little history first: about 5 years ago I bought an Invicta 8926 to get started in the world of automatic watches. It lived up to the rave reviews I had read online and I was very pleased with its quality and performance. However, 5 years is about the shelf life for any automatic watch before an overhaul is necessary (it employs a mechanical engine after all). This costs anywhere from $150 to $200 and it's a procedure just as necessary to keep a Rolex running well as a Seiko or, well, an Invicta. Along with needing routine servicing my old Invicta had become pretty beat up from years of hard use--camping, hiking, rafting, swimming, and so on--and much as I like the watch I just couldn't justify spending two to three as mucch on repairs as I originally paid for the watch.\n\nSo I decided to get a new Invicta but wanted something a little different than the classic Submariner look and thought I'd take a chance on this model. I've had it for a week and am very impressed. The scalloped bezel and markings on the bezel insert are derived from the design of Omega dive watches and so offer a variation on the Rolex theme. The 9094 is not exactly original but it is unique insofar as it combines features from several classic dive watch styles. Also, as far as I know, the gleaming, rather than brushed, center links of the bracelet are a feature unique to Invicta dive watches. I think it's a great touch. It also looks like Invicta has made some improvements over the years in terms of design. The crown guards are much less clunky than on my 8926 and it sounds like the rotor spins much more easily. The latter is just my impression. Also, the face of the 9094 picks up the light beautifully and, like other reviewers, I have to say that pictures simply don't do the watch justice. It's running very accurately, a bit fast perhaps but this is par for the course for mechanical watches and it should settle down in the next couple of months.\n\nI have one complaint: the bezel was pretty stiff out of the box but a couple of drops of Tri-Flow lubricant placed in the seam between the bezel and the body of the watch loosened it up nicely.\n\nAll in all: I highly recommend this watch. At $70 and with free shipping it's an astonishing deal for a high quality timepiece.", "summary": "Very impressive . . .", "unixReviewTime": 1279065600}

It is good looking, well-made (for the price) and durable thus far. Only con is that it seems to gain couple seconds a day, therefore, at the end of the month, it is about minute or two fast -  I suppose it's better than  being slow but this is expected from a non-quartz movement type of watches that use unadjusted automatic movement.  It's a trade-off for not having the need to replace the battery every few years.  If you are like me and like to wear different watches for different occasions, auto-movement watches can be a pain unless you invest in auto-winder or two.\n\nI disagree with some people; I think Invicta watches in general (I have several Invictas) have decent bands that are nicely finished and have sufficient heft to them. Compared to comparable Seiko 5 automatic watches, Seikos have cheap, light weight, rough feel to them, although the Seiko 5 are also a good choice for a daily beater - their bands tend to give out long before their auto-movements do. These Pro Diver series that ape Rolex/Omega design are the ones that put Invicta on the map in the watch world.\n\nAlthough the style is easy to copy, customer service apparently is not as noted by many user here and other watch forums. But then, if I get several years of trouble-free use out them, I'm happy. If you want the legendary service, you gonna have to pony up for a real thing (Rolex) through its authorized dealer.", "summary": "Stylish, affordable and durable", "unixReviewTime": 1272499200}

Three negatives, it is a hair puller and the edges could be a bit smoother and the clasp is impossible to open for me unless I use something sharp to POP it open. I have fingernails and it's still difficult to open. Overall a great watch for the money and the packaging is beautiful.\n\nEDIT- on a side note do NOT expect good service from Invicta. They do not answer emails (do a search, they are known for ignoring emails). Once the sale is made they could care less so be prepared. The kool-aid drinking Invicta lovers either A. had to never deal with them on a service issue or B. are so brainwashed they look the other way. I sent them over 10 emails over a 2 month period and not ONE reply. I am not alone. These companies that do not reply to email should just get rid of their email system.

I tried to hand it toward the top of my Coleman tent, facing down, but after a minute or two the blade spun off of the shaft and ended up on the tent floor.  My biggest issue is that the metal piece that holds the magnet (the part that comes unglued) sticks out past the bottom of the fan.  This means that its semi-sharp corners dig into the tent material (see my photo).  To remove the fan, the instructions say to twist the metal plate off of the magnet, but doing this can also twist those corners into your material, thus causing damage to the tent.  I still use the fan but I had to do mods to it to make it functional including:\n*Roughing up the blade shaft with a file, and then epoxying the fan blade to the shaft.\n*Epoxying the magnet into the base\n*Taking the magnet holder to a bench grinder to make it sit under the surface of the fan base and then covering the base bottom with foil tape to make it smooth.\n\nIf someone could fix all of these negatives and design a new fan, it would be a great success.", "summary": "Not a good product", "unixReviewTime": 1436659200}

It works pretty well. There's just one fan speed, the button is good, it moves a good amount of air but you can't get too far from it, and it's relatively quiet. The magnet on the bottom is MASSIVELY powerful for such a small, lightweight fan. I guess Coleman was worried a weaker magnet would cause this unit to fall off of things too easily. The metal plate is great for securing the fan to a tent wall, and the magnet redily locks onto metal tent poles or whatever. I've used it for probably 150 hours now and have only gone through 2 batteries, so it's pretty energy efficient.\n\nMy only complaint is that the material the main housing is made out of isn't as durable as it should be (especially with that big magnet working on it). There are two notches in the plastic base that the battery-door (which also holds the magnet) uses to close. One clip is broken on mine because the magnet held while the unit came away when I went to pull it off a tent pole. That's why only 3 stars.

Sometimes I attach them to the canopy over our picnic table or just carry them.  We use these fans on every trip and I never worry about them falling or breaking or running out of juice.  I don't know what others are doing with their fans to have such poor performance.  I keep mine in a coffee can between trips, in a hot attic (w/o battery of course) and they work time and and time again with no problems.  I just pull off the propellers and put the pieces in the can.  Simple.  With the magnetic grip you can attach it right to the gear loft and enjoy a great breeze just like having a ceiling fan.  I love them.  By the way... you might think open blades are a safety issue but they are very gentle and stop the instant they encounter an obstruction.  I've stuck my fingers in them many times (as have my children) and they have been totally harmless.  The blade stops instantly and it doesn't hurt one bit.  It's kind of a good party joke.

The cealing does not have a closeable nylon covers inside the tent.  This is because it is a 3 season tent.  If you were able to close it to keep dust out you would find that the tent would be wet from condensation inside on the inside.  So the cealing is mesh to let warm air and moisture excape.  The rainfly keeps moisture out.\n\nIf the cealing had zipper covering over the mesh,it would be a 4 season tent useable in winter.\n\nThe tent sets up easy and served us well in our first weekend camoing in it.  We did not get any real rain so I cant comment on its waterproof effectiveness.  But it is gaurenteed waterproof.\n\nI love the headroom and the zippers opperated smoothly without a snag.\n\nI'm happy with it. Hope this is helpful.\n\n5-13-2008\n\nI used this tent 6 times this year already.  One night it rained very hard.  The tent was amazing as not one drop on either of us throught the entire storm.  I honestly thought that we were going to get wet.  This tent does what it says.\n\nUpdate 2009\n\nOk it is now 2009, the rainfly ripped last year but Coleman sent me a new replacement at no charge. Suggestion, you don't need to tighten the 2 side rain fly cords so tight just enough so they are away from the tent. You should however tighten the 4 corner rain fly cords snug, this help keep the rainflt and tent stable and keep pressure off the 2 side rain fly cords where rips occurred. Follow this and you should not tear your rain fly. It rained all weekend while camping this weekend. 2 nights very hard and not a drop on us. third season and the tent still has no issues.

There is very little chance of the fan falling because the magnet that connects the back plate which goes on the outside of the tent and the rest of the fan is strong...really strong.

What is that $3 extra dollars REALLY worth to you (besides the gas it costs you to drive to Wal-Mart....)\n\n2) \"Great if you have really small eggs\"\nI couldn't agree more.  We have our own chickens in the backyard (rural) and this crate is actually preferred because their eggs are smaller...this smaller container provides them with better protection than a bigger one where they'd have room to roll/bounce around.  For those of you without chickens; here is your solution:\n\nGet chickens.  They are fun to watch for adults having a cocktail in the backyard...they are great entertainment for the kids, and your dogs will ignore them and vice-versa after the first few days with any minimal training.  Six of them cost us approximately $30/year and we get 4 to 6 eggs a day every day for 30 days every month (That equates to 10 cartons a month...9 of which we generally give away and occasionally sell at the Farmer's Market if we have too many).  Last year we paid for our annual cost with the first months eggs, everyone we know had farm-fresh eggs year-round for free, and at $2/carton it is $240/year worth of eggs you don't have to buy.\n\nWith those savings you could buy 10 of these COntainer's and give your first crop of backyard eggs to your friends in fancy containers that they can go camping with.

Bulbs can be replaced.\n\nUPDATE:  i do like this lantern, however, i found one that i like even better.  it has a better light and seems much more durable.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/GE-SteelBEAM-Classic-Krypton-Lantern-Green/dp/B0025XZ6AY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">GE SteelBEAM Classic Krypton Lantern (Green)</a>", "summary": "Quality build, good light output for smaller areas, easily transportable", "unixReviewTime": 1264723200}

I think it's poorly designed.\n\nI bought this egg container thinking it would keep uncooked eggs from rattling around in my cooler. But I found that even using the largest eggs I could find in the store (jumbo) there was enough room in each compartment to allow the jumbo eggs to move and rattle around. I did not toss the case around or hit lots of bumps on the road (as I carried the cooler in my car) to see if the uncooked eggs would break - sorry, I just didn't feel like tempting fate and cleaning up the mess. But I'm not confident they would not break since there is so much movement of the eggs inside the case, and since there are \"nibs\" the eggs bump against. In other words, the inside of the egg holder is not completely smooth on both sides. See my photos above for close up of the inside.\n\nThen I thought I can still use it to hold hard boiled eggs because I don't have to fear hard boiled eggs cracking and breaking and making a mess. But that's not good for me because I want to peel the eggs before putting them in the case, which is what I wanted to do so I could have easy to grab and eat hard boiled eggs as an easy snack while driving on a very long road trip. With peeled eggs you have to deal with these \"nibs\" cutting up your hard boiled eggs. As I mentioned above, the top of half of the case has these annoying tiny \"nibs\" in it (can't think of a better word to describe them, see my photos for details) and the nibs poke and pierce the peeled eggs, which allows the introduction of bacteria into the eggs. These annoying nibs appear to be there to hold the eggs in place, but they don't (peeled or not), as I mentioned above, even jumbo eggs (in the shell) rattle around loosely in the holder.\n\nA better design would have been a thin plastic tongue instead of the nibs. The plastic tongue could act like tiny spring board, holding any egg in place. The trick would be to make sure the pressure of the plastic spring would not break a raw egg. But once that was done right, you could put virtually any egg inside (any size, peeled or not), the tiny smooth \"spring board\" would adjust to any size egg, and it would not rattle, crack, or puncture the eggs.\n\nAnd, the case/container can NOT stand up on it's own due to the tiny hinges. It must lay flat.\n\nThe design has one possible pro; the clasps are very basic and seem sturdy. The best way to get the case open easily is to pry open the handles (separating them from each other). This is a good design, if you want to make sure the case does not pop open easily, on its own or by small children. But, for someone with a disability or arthritis, opening the case would be difficult.\n\nBottom line. I think overall this case was poorly designed and a waste of money. Especially since I now have a plastic container I'll rarely (if ever) use that I may end up giving away or putting in the recycle bin. There are other brands of egg holders but I won't buy another one by mail because the coast of returning is not worth the hassle. Amazon is usually good about returns, but only if an item is defective, and I don't think defective \"design\" or poor design qualifies for free returns. My loss. I'll be more careful next time with items that need to \"fit\" properly.\n\nThese are the measurements (see photos also):\nWidth - 7.5\"\nLength w/o handle - 5.75\"\nLength with handle - 6.75\"\nDepth - 3.25\"", "summary": "Eh, it's okay, but I would NOT recommend.

After deciding to try one out, I picked one of these up lightly used on fleabay for $26.  I can't see any reason to overpay for anything.  As far as some people having problems with these stoves, I just can't imagine it.  This little stove is pretty awesome. If you take the time to make sure your stove is properly pressurized, it runs like a champ. It's very efficient with the fuel use too.  I got an entire weekend camping trip's worth of cooking for my family of 4 out of a single fill-up of Coleman fuel. That leads me to another important point: If you don't want your generator gumming up, don't run cheap unleaded gas in this thing. Sure, you can do it, but it's like running poor grade fuel in your car.  You want to spring for the pure, clean stuff this stove was meant to run best on. If you have the good sense to set the stove up on a flat level surface as you should, you'll have no trouble using a full sized cast iron skillet on this stove. I did it.  My wife even heated her up some water for her tea in a mil spec canteen cup on this thing. I thought she was nuts, but it worked and did it very quickly.  She did use my pot glove to remove her cup for safety's sake.  My stove seems to have no problem adjusting anywhere from a low simmering flame to a blast furnace.  I honestly thought it would be a high or low only option, but you can finesse the controls to get the output you want.  It's not featherlight, but it's not a boat anchor either.  I'd say it's worth its weight in your gear. It really isn't huge, coming in at under 6 inches tall and about 5 1/2 inches or so across at the base, but it has a heft to it being made of steel.  I guess the best praise I can give this stove is that once she used it my wife didn't give me crap about buying it.  That's the official seal of approval in a married man's house.

Has a nice chrome ring at the top of the pot where the lid fits in, a spot that is vulnerable to chip in most enamel pots. This smaller model is also good for heating water for tea, hot chocolate, and dishes. I have one for that purpose, and the 14 cup model for coffee. I prefer percolators over drip coffeemakers. I have never had to replace a stove top percolator because it was broken, but have owned countless expensive drip coffeemakers. Breakable carafes, clock to reset, takes up counter-space, buttons to fuss with, filters to replace. My simple pot lasts years longer, (I have one from the 1940's), and the clean-up and maintenance is simpler.\n\nCONS: Like a drip, there is a learning curve. This type of pot does not have a water marker for example. But there is a simple instruction sheet in the box. Next, many of the new percolator pots have strainer baskets that are really flimsy in design, including both the Coleman and the GSI brand. The real problem is the upright stem, it tilts over if you know what I mean. If they improved the basket assembly with a heavier grade aluminum, or stainless steel I think it would solve the problem. I replaced the upright stem and basket in mine with an old sturdy one from a old pot I found at a yard sale. For some weird reason, most of the manufacturers basket is the same size, no matter how big the pot is. Most stainless steel kitchen (non camp) models have a stainless basket. Last, on models with the glass dome, some folks can break them. They sell replacements in 2 sizes at Amazon.com for less than a pack of paper filters.  The good news is that Coleman will mail you a replacement dome for free if you break it, email them through their web site seems to be the best way to get this done. I am guessing they would also replace the filter?\n\nTIPS: Wet the inside of the basket before you put grounds in, to help prevent grounds from going through the holes. Use a medium ground blend. If you plan to use it on a camp fire, soap the outside of the pot and let dry for a minute before placing on the fire, to prevent soot stains. If you do it every time, it will stay looking like new.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Coleman also sells a 12 cup and a 14 cup in this shape, the 14 cup is my favorite and looks identical with the exception of the additional glass dome to monitor the coffee percolating. The 12 cup is Stainless Steel, and also has a dome. Their competitor GSI makes an 8 cup in red or blue.", "summary": "Percolator vs the Drip", "unixReviewTime": 1259107200}

Once it is lit you have to constantly adjust it to try to keep it at a certain flame size, and you can forget about keeping it at a low flame setting as it will go out.  That is because the flame vaporizes the gas in the copper hose that runs over it and if the flame is not hot enough it goes out.  If you open the valve for more gas it increases the flame size initially but then as the hose gets hotter and vaporizes more fuel the flame continues to grow. The unit is high quality and durable but it is just outdated technology.  If you are old fashioned and more comfortable with something you are already familiar with, or if you absolutely need to use liquid fuel for some reason, then this is a good stove.  I returned it and got a propane stove that is so much easier to use and maintain a consistent flame size.  Just turn it on, light it, and adjust the flame size, that simple.  Plus, propane seems to be more readily available than Coleman fuel, perhaps that is because liquid fuel stoves are a dying breed.", "summary": "It's a hassle, propane is much easier", "unixReviewTime": 1377648000}

However, my experience with the 533 literally 'left me cold' a couple of times. I spoke to the owner of a local Coleman repair station who told me that if I wanted reliability, I should stick with stoves/lanterns painted red or green (in other words, older models) and follow basic maintenance procedures for them. In his experience, even those running the dual-fuel models on Coleman fuel experienced less overall reliability than older models in good condition.\n\n While I still enjoy firing up my old gasoline Colemans once in a while, I don't recommend any type (especially not the 533) to those who desire a hassle-free camp stove. Bring a backup cooking option if you can.\n\n Coleman makes a great single-burner propane camp stove (Model No. 2000004125) that I've been using regularly for several years now.

While car camping I can make coffee on this 533 while the rest of breakfast cooks on the 2 burner one.\nI have never cooked food with Regular Unleaded Gas (RUG) but I have used one of these stoves with RUG to melt wax for making candles it seemed to burn just as well as the camp fuel (aka white gas) .\nThis stove cranks out a lot of heat on high, too much really for the smaller pots that will fit on this stove. So I use it on medium to low mostly.  Since this is a single burner it probably isn't to wise to use a big pot and have it tip over.  I rigged up a home made device, from an old barbeque grate, to hold larger pots, but it is not foldable. I wish Coleman would design and make an accessory stand or stove grate for the Sportster II with collapsible legs that the stove could be placed under and a larger pot safely on top.  Hey, Coleman I would be willing to test market such a device!\nThis is a great stove, not quite as well made as the old 502's but still very good. I have had one since '99 and the other since '05 w/ no problems and use them frequently. It is indeed a bit tricky to get this stove to simmer and it doesn't simmer very well, but it will simmer. Trick is is to get it hot first, then turn it down to a simmer, the generator (tube across burner) must be hot to vaporize the liquid. If the simmer does start to go out remove the pot turn it back to high for minute or so and then back down to simmer and repalce the pot or pan.\n\nBTW if using unleaded gas in this or any Coleman Dual Fuel appliance use regular 87 octane or less b/c it has less addidtives than premium or super grade gasoline. Also buy the gasoline from generic stations that don't offer the additive packages like the name brand stations. You're operating a stove not a car. Think about it, Coleman fuel (a.k.a. white gas) is basiacly a pure unleaded gasoline (naptha) with out all the additives designed for automotove gasoline. These additives are what plug up the generators so the less additives the better. Coleman fuel only has an octane rating of 55, there is no need to use high octane gas.  Besides do you really want to cook food with fuel that has more toxic chemicals than needed? Some reviewers that gave this stove low  marks said they used 93 high octane and then complained when it clogged up! If the generator does clog it can be user serviced and cleaned or new ones are of course available. It's your choice.", "summary": "Great stove", "unixReviewTime": 1305849600}

But if you're using this for car camping, then weight isn't much of a concern and you can use more sturdy cooking gear.\n\nIt therefore sits in kind of a weird place, and if you're a minimalist/spartan-type camper you'll probably be very frustrated with this item, regardless of the type of camping you're doing.  I mean, it's made well enough for what it is, but pieces are kind of redundant (I usually eat from the same vessel I cook in), and very lightweight aluminum which scratches/gouges easily if you aren't careful.

Much cheaper than other sets on here.\nCons:\n- Food does stick.  As other reviews say, use sand or gravel to scrub, then rinse with water.  Good as new.\n- Handle can get hot if left on fire or heat source for a long time.\n- Metal cup can get hot when filled with hot liquids.\n\nOverall, I think this is a great set for its purpose.  I am not cooking gourmet meals when I camp, because I'm trying to save weight and time and not bring all kinds of food supplies.  This set allows one to boil water and fry something simultaneously, then have a mess plate to throw your eggs in and a cup to drink the coffee you just boiled in.

Well, this tent light has positive and negative things. First of all, I use this product in a Coleman tent of about 8-feet x 8-feet. It is bright enough to help you during a night, not to read o play cards, just enough light to move within the tent. Consider that there is a new model with leds instead this krypton bulb but costs almost as double as this is. The advantage of having magnets (and a metal plate) to mount it on the tent gives you the advantage of putting it virtually in any place of the tent. Most of the lanterns have to be mounted (hang them) on the top of the tent, but this is practically to be mounted anywere in your tent. Particularly I place it right at the top of the tent's door.\n\nMaybe having two of them for my tent would be nice and bright enough if I put them in opposite walls, but I'm not gonna do that because I already own a Brunton Glorb Four LED Lantern, wich gives a poor light to be a four leds, but combining this and the Coleman is enough light.\n\nThe main cons I found in this Coleman tent light is its brightness, enough to see inside the tent but no more. Again consider that newest models of Led lanterns will give more brighter light than this on (but maybe they will cost more tha this one). It is heavy for backpacking but quite well in my case because I do car camping. So, again, consider that a Led Lanter can be smaller and lighter. As consequence of its weight, you have to be cautios were you place it, and consider that it will make your tent sag in that zone you place it.\n\nThe best thing of it is the idea of the magnets and the mounting plate.

(It's got a pretty strong magnet bar, which goes on the outside of your tent, and the metal bracket of the light anchors it on the inside.)  At first I wondered if the tight contact of the light would cause the tent to leak, and so far the answer has been a very clear and dry no, on many tents of different fabric.\n\nThe light is incandescent, inside a traditional sealed bulb.  I have had no problem with the light or bulb in the 4+ years I've owned this light.  The lens diffuses the light nicely, so if you put this light at the crown of your tent, you will have light throughout.\n\nMy only problem with this unit is that it's kind of big and bulky.  It's not that heavy, even with the four AA batteries installed, but it's kind of large.  In a camping world in which we've got wind-up LED systems and increasingly smaller lights which provide more and more light, I would think that an up-tech'd version of this light could be smaller and throw out more light.  If you're doing backwoods trekking where every ounce counts, this is probably not the solution you need.  But if you're doing family camping, car camping, or going to camps that have existing tents (summer camps, scout camps), then this is a really fantastic piece of gear.\n\n----------\n\nUpdate, 24 July 2008\nNow about a year on, here are additional comments on this product:\n\nIt continues to function just fine, but I have one complaint.  I do not store this unit with batteries in it, so each time I go camping I open the case to install and then later remove the batteries.\n\n(The case opens by way of gently pinching the two sides together at the lamp's waist, between the on/off switch and the lower magnetic housing.  There are no locks, screws, springs or mechanical latches; the two parts of the lamp are kept together only by the plastic flex of the upper lamp housing itself.)\n\nAfter a year of easy and careful use the upper plastic housing around the pinch points has started to crack.  The unit still works just fine (I just got back from a week in the woods), but it's only a matter of time now until the housing splits or a large chunk of the plastic comes off, preventing the unit from coming together and thereby ruining it.\n\n----------------\n\nUpdate, 26 May 2009\nThe cracks at the waist are slightly bigger, and slowly growing.  The light still works fine, and just served me well on yet another campout, but the day is coming when that plastic housing breaks permanently, and this light will be finished.\n\n----------------\n\nUpdate, 8 October 2010\nAnother spring and summer gone, and this light continues to soldier on.  It's still got its original bulb and all other original parts.  No corrosion, no rust inside or out.  No clouding of the plastic lens.  The cracking of the waist area I mention above has stabilized somewhat, with no plastic pieces having come off. It still works great, and it'll be with me into another fall and winter of Scout camping.\n\n----------------\n\nUpdate, 2 June 2011\nGetting ready for another campout this weekend, and this light is packed and ready to go.  No changes since the last update, still working just fine.\n\n----------------\n\nUpdate, 19 October 2012\n\nMan, a perfect score for helpful votes--thank you, all.  This was an easy review to write for what has turned out to be a great product.\n\nI just broke it out of the attic for a camping trip tomorrow evening, and with four AA batteries dropped in, it still works like a charm.  There is no further degradation to the plastic, no flaking, discoloration, cracks or pieces coming off.  It is not brittle, but still gives nicely, and came apart and went back together just as easily as any time before.  It'll be lighting my tent tomorrow night, as it has on so many nights before.\n\nI see that there is a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Coleman-LED-tent-light/dp/B004E4GB1U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Coleman LED tent light</a>&nbsp;now, for about $8 more.

I do a lot of backpacking in NY mountains, so that's the context of my usage. I use this kit with an&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/MSR-PocketRocket-Stove/dp/B00E1I36Q2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">MSR PocketRocket Stove</a>. I've used this kit for about 3 years.\n\nI try to avoid cooking on the trail as much as possible just for the sake of convenience, but in the cold weather it's really nice to have a warm meal and a warm cup of coffee. So I can't speak to this product's usefulness for trail gourmands.\n\nMy go-to meal for backpacking is couscous. This is how it works out:\n\n1. Pour one 6oz box of couscous and seasoning in the skillet (with 1/4 of TVP sometimes), plus some olive oil.\n2. Boil water in the lidded pot.\n3. Pour boiling water over couscous (as much as can fit is perfect).\n4. Stir.\n5. Cover with bowl/lid, and then cover with bandana. (Colder weather = More insulation)\n6. Wait 5 minutes.\n7. Eat!\n\nAnd I'm left with only one vessel (the skillet) that needs real cleaning.\n\nI use the pot for boiling water only. This means that I never have to scrub it out on the trail, and that my morning coffee won't taste like garlic couscous. The plastic handle on the pot lid is a nice improvement over the metal lid handle on older sets.\n\nIt's nice to have a separate cup instead of drinking out of an all-purpose pot. Allows me to have a hot drink while eating a warm meal, and - again - a drink that doesn't taste like a previous meal.\n\nPros:\n1. The four separate vessels may seem anti-minimalist, but the convenience is worth it\n2. Light as light can be\n3. Heats up very quickly\n4. Packs together neatly\n5. Don't abuse it, and it lasts for many years\n6. Inexpensive\n\nCons:\n1. Aluminum cup will burn your mouth if filled with very hot liquid. The metal conducts the heat too well. I've found that putting a small piece of electrical tape where my lips meet the cup solves this, but it must be reapplied before each trip. Consider replacing with plastic cup.\n2. Along those lines, it does not hold heat well. You'll want to put something beneath it and cover it with a bandana or something assuming your food has to sit off the flame for awhile before eating.\n3. No carrying case included. I tie it up in a bandana and then use the bandana as a potholder/insulator when I eat.\n4. The material is delicate. If this goes in the bottom of your backpack all day, it will get bent and dented. The good news is that it's easy enough to bend back in to shape (to some extent).\n\nFor me, this is perfect. But it depends on your cooking style and your needs.

Sure the handle gets hot if the coffee is really steaming, but it dissipates quickly if used outdoors where it has always been in service with me.  The number of times I have used it at home over the fire place the hot handle has never bothered me since I don't get the coffee as hot as over a campfire.\n\nAs to some of the other more critical reviews of this about it chipping and peeling, I think one of the fallacies about old time enamel mugs like these is that they are prit' near indestructible which is not true.  Just because they are made of metal you can't toss them on a pile of rocks or expose them to all manner of rough weather.  I've always treated mine like they are made of out glass and done just fine with them.  No doubt some of the reviewers here that had their mugs peel and whatnot were as careful as I am and still saw their mugs fail or fall apart way too fast.  All I can tell you is that the number I have owned have held up well for me and I have never had a problem with them.  Altogether a rugged, well made old time mug at a good price that I highly recommend... : )", "summary": "Great Old Time Mug", "unixReviewTime": 1382140800}

Little did I know that the workmanship of this mess kit is sub par at best: that it's made for beginners and Boys scouts in particular made as their first kit. So I just accepted the fact that I can never fry perfectly good eggs with this until i came to a Army Surplus store  in Berkeley and found my first REAL Military mess kit which is the German Bundeswehr mess kit. It was $9.95 and I said \"Why Not!?\" I tested that and immediately i found out that having the RIGHT gear really makes all the difference! I fried a couple of scrambled and sunny side up eggs on that mess kit that now I know how to fry it right and it's perfect every time! Right after that, I decide to donate this Coleman mess kit to charity and vowed never again to use inferior-made products. It was worth a little from when I used it but I wasn't satisfied from the results from it. And just like everything else in life...you actually get what you pay for, Using a Military mess kit against this is like night and day difference. My newly acquired German mess kit was clunky, quite heavy but robust, dependable and made just like a Tiger tank! This mess kit was flimsy..just like any other American-made car with a ton issues. This kit is NOT recommended and you would be advise to look for a better mess kit anywhere else. If mess kits is your thing then I would advise to get ANY military made mess kits for they're not only dependable but also \"battle-tested\" and used in the field.

Just add a fork spoon and knife set and you are golden. Also if you do put this directly in a fire maybe replace the plastic knob on the top just in case.

After using the military-issue mess kits, I wanted some more for camping. This is what I ended up getting. I'm disappointed. I'll talk about this kit piece-by-piece.\n\nIn general, the aluminum is pretty thin for a mess kit. Even when being very careful, I can only get five or six uses out of a piece before it gets too weak to be useful. The metal bends, melts, and gets holes in it with normal use. It's just not made to withstand heat. Yes, it all nests together, provided you put it back together the same way it came out of the box. I've found that I have to bend the plate (which is more like a bowl) somewhat to get it all back together. Unacceptable.\n\n-Eight-ounce cup. Yeah, it's an aluminum cup with a handle. It holds eight ounces. The handle comes off without much use, which of course it's not supposed to. If you're thinking about boiling water in this... don't. This will work fine as a cup for cooled liquids.\n-Six-inch deep dish plate. It's not six inches deep. It's 6 inches in diameter, and about 1-1/2\" deep. It's more like a shallow bowl. Good for using as a plate or shallow bowl. The corners seem to be weak in mine, but the bottom always burns through first. It's better than using a sheet of aluminum foil, but not by much.\n-7.5 inch frying pan. This is the same as the plate, just a tiny bit larger, but with a handle secured to it with a wingnut. Tighten the wingnut to lock the handle into place, either open for frying pan use, or closed to keep the kit together. The handle is very weak, and can barely support the weight of the pan with food in it. Again, it falls apart with normal use.\n-16-ounce pot with lid. The pot and lid count as two pieces in this five-piece set. It's a weak pot with a weak hanging wire. You can boil some water in it, sure, but it's not well-suited for cooking food. The lid is crappy and thin, and the small nub on the top (it's supposed to be a knob) is just a piece of plastic that's lazily screwed into the lid. Between the screw and the underside of the lid is, well glue. Something to drip into your boiling water when it heats up.\n\nOverall, this is a very cheap set. Not inexpensive at nine dollars, but cheap. It's flimsy, and at times, dangerous. There's no way you're going to make a meal, even for one person, with this thing without spilling stuff. Better than aluminum foil, sure, but not by much. Also, make sure you stick some plastic silverware in this. You'll have to snap off the butt end of everything so it fits, but you'll have it.", "summary": "Cheap, Disposable", "unixReviewTime": 1340582400}

I hesitated buying this knife for several years because I wasn't crazy about its place of manufacture. While I buy plenty of knives made in China and have found many of them quite good, even excellent, I was upset that the Coleman knife was made there.\n\nAs I found myself away from home on a trip and without a knife but needing one, I ran to the local big box store to grab a knife. My choices were paying $25 for a Swiss Army knife or $10 for the Coleman.  As I wasn't sure how I was going to get the knife back home on the airplane; I settled on the Coleman knife.\n\nI'm glad I did.

For the price, it is hard to beat this little hobo. It is solidly built and lives up to Coleman's reputation of fine camping gear. I was able to clean it with running hot water. I'd advise leaving it disassembled with the all utensils in the open position while drying.\n\nThe fork is small but you can poke chunks of meat with it and the tines will hold. The caplifter worked quite well.  Admittedly, I did not use the can opener as I had a P-38 with me.\n\nMy only real complaint it the key ring is a tad small which makes attaching a lanyard a bit difficult.\n\nIn all, I found the knife very useful and was happy that I found a post office so I could mail it back home on the last day of my trip.

I have an 8x8 baking stone that was a thrift store find that I use in the bottom.

This tent was built in a fashion that neither of these issues were a problem. The plastic bottom extends up the sides about six inches, making a great lower water barrier. The top half of both sides of the tent are netting. The rain cover extends out over the front and back doors, and about six inches from the netting on the sides. This allows for ventilation, but also assures privacy (as no one can see in through the netting unless they actually bother to come and stick their head in between it and the cover). The rain cover extending over the doorways also helps to keep out rain if you are slipping in and out of the tent during a shower. The last weekend that we used it, we had a twelve hour Florida rain. All of our belongings stayed nice and dry. It was about 50F out, but with the doors totally zipped, it didn't get too cool either. It comes with a couple of neat features. There are pockets sewn into the inside, to help you keep track of your pocket items, glasses, and other little things. There is a door on both sides, and plastic \"welcome mats\" the stake down outside, which helps keep the sand out (beach campers here). There is a small zipper in the back to allow electrical access, without opening up your entire tent. There is also a small (approx 12\") access door down low to the side. It has both netting and a full cloth door. It says that it is so you can access your cooler or place a fan. We were thinking it would be perfect if you have a small dog that needs to go out at 3 am. Put it on a leash, unzip the small door, and not have to get out of your sleeping bag (just be sure to pick up anything he may have \"left behind\" come morning). I like that in addition to hooks, the rain cover also has Velcro straps that wrap around the tent poles. It was pretty windy during parts of the last storm, but it stayed firmly in place. Due to the large amount of netting used in this tent, I am not sure how well it would do in very low temperatures, but for Florida it is a great product. As long as you are camping in mildly cool to warmer weather, I can recommend this tent to you.\n\n****Just a quick update*** We went beach camping with this tent. A heavy storm came up. The winds were sustained at 35 mph, and it was holding up fine. We started getting gusts of 57 mph, and the poles on the side taking the brunt of it snapped. I think that is a fair expectation for this style of tent in a storm of that strength. We drove into town the next morning, and went to Wal-Mart. They had replacement Coleman pole kits, but the sizes were off a bit, and we had to use a pocketknife to shave some off to make them fit into the joints of the other sections. Lesson learned...buy a replacement pole kit for your specific model ahead of time. It will make life a little easier if you have an incident.", "summary": "Perfect for cool to hot weather", "unixReviewTime": 1297036800}

It is also very convenient and easty to use.  You just screw the top on and plump the cylinder into the base.  It uses the short, fat cylinders--not the longer kind you usually see plumbers using with torches.\n\nI had one of these things but I cannot locate the thing anywhere so when Hurricane Irma headed towards Florida I hurried and ordered another one.  Thankfully, the hurricane did not hit the part of Florida I live in, the panhandle.\n\nMy old stove got me and my late father through the hell that was Hurrican Ivan which did hit here in September of 2004.  We did not have power or drinking water for the better part of the week and half the trees were knocked down.  Our roof lost every other row of shingles, the storm windows blew out with loud bangs, and the siding of our house, which my neighbor, John, returned to me as a joke, blew three blocks down the street.\n\nDad and I did have hot coffee and hot meals, though, and we did have plenty of water since I am a home winemaker and had filled my six  six gallong fermenter spigot buckets up to the brim.\n\nI also have a two burner, Coleman propane stove around someplace but I cannot find that either.  I used this stove once or twice before deciding the single burner was more than sufficient for coffee, tea, or dinner.  We ate chilit mostly, Hormel with no beans with two cans of Bush's chili beans thrown in.\n\nWith this stove, you do not have to go through the routine of putting soapy water on the joints to check for gas leaks.  There is only one connection.  If it does hiss when you screw it on it means the valve is open so you just rotate it.\n\nTo light it, just open the valve a bit until it hisses and light it with a match or butane lighter.  You turn it down or up or off with the valve.\n\nIn case you are not familiar with propane torches, the gas coming out makes the connection near the tank icy cold to the point that frost starts to form.  No kidding.  Frost will form because it is the same principle that makes your refrigerator work.  I said torch mind you.  I did not let the burner run full blast.  The flame might eventually hurt the cooking grid part though it seems very sturdy.\n\nI think they have improved this burner a bit since my old one and, if I ever find the old one, I will compare the two.\n\nA word about liquid fuel stoves.  A Wal Mart add for a dual fuel stove said the Coleman dual fuel will burn over four times what's in a cylinder per gallon.  This is a no brainer though since the cylinders only contain a bit over sixteen ounces of liquid and the gallon has 128 ounces.\n\nThe also used to make endless jokes about liquid fuel gasoline stoves blowing up and sending people to heaven when I was little.\n\\\nThe straight line gases in order from lighest to heaviest are:  methane, ethane, propane, and butane.  After this you get gasolines followed by mineral spirits, kerosenes, fuel oils, and paraffins like Vaseline and tars.\n\nMethane and ethane, often called natural gas, are not liquids at safe pressure.  Propane is a liquid at about 15 atmospheres of pressure.  The stuff in your little bottles is a liquid and not a gas.  Butane is liquid at about the pressures you find in soda or beer bottles.  This makes butane ideal for plastic lighters though it is more expensive normally than propane per ounce.  Natural gass, of course, is cheap but an actually cylinder of gas, as opposed to liquid, would give you very little cooking time.  They do use gas gas in city vehicles but the things do not have a great range per charge.\n\nSo: if you live in hurricane country or like to camp, this and other Coleman products are very nice.

Not a good way to start, huh?  So after a few days of healing, the replacement unit was unfolded and assembled....but not easily.  The metal tabs did not align properly and the top was slightly bowed;  this made for a very frustrating ordeal, not unlike wack-a-mole as one tab would come out as the others were inserted.  The 'problem' was fixed after using a pair of needle nose pliers and pushing from the inside to seat each tab-: ta-da!! Now for the cooking part: I use this on a Camp Chef and it  heated up quickly and cooks very hot on low.  Ergo, the cobbler, bread and polenta had rather toasty undersides, but other than that, the food was cooked evenly and on time.  My caveats are this: WEAR gloves when removing and assembling and check for sharp edges; practice a few times (empty) to find out how it functions with your particular stove;  place a small cooking stone in the bottom to diffuse the heat and avoid scorching;  This a a real hot box/hurt locker so be very careful to avoid touching it while cooking, and wear hand and arm protection when removing foods.  My last recommendation is once it is assembled, leave it that way until it needs to be stored or transported, Otherwise, keep the first aid kit or band aids handy. This product fills a cooking niche that can improve camp cuisine or reduce kitchen heat in the summer if properly and safely used.", "summary": "Hot Box", "unixReviewTime": 1497139200}

I went to Youtube and found a bunch of videos showing what other people are cooking in this.  Hey, one guy baked a small loaf of bread in it!  Amazing.  But, as I also found out on Youtube, the thermometer on the outside of the door is not accurate.  So I got a small thermometer for the inside of the oven to get a more accurate reading, which is especially important for baked goods since there could be a 75 degree difference between the thermometers.\nMy only complaint is the assembly.

As I was preheating it to bake the bread, I found it was really struggling to get over 400dF, when I needed it to be 475. All the while it was smoking (as I expected) and seemed awfully hot - after all it was over a 10,000 BTU burner on high. I put a separate oven thermometer inside and closed the door. It was well over 600dF. Once I got the bread inside after cooling it to 475, I could watch the oven temp gauge outside after matching it to the right number inside. My second issue is that because I was unknowingly heating it so high, there was some minor warping afterwards. Otherwise, I think the oven is well conceived, well priced and adequately constructed.

At $30 I gave it a shot and have used it for 3 camping weekends thus far.  Holy moly, I can't figure out how we lived without it now.  It is astonishing how much a pan of cinnamon rolls on a cold morning can change morale.\n\nI use the oven on a Coleman Grill Stove&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Coleman-PerfectFlow-Insta-Start-Grill-Stove/dp/B000BPEE4M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Coleman PerfectFlow Insta Start Grill Stove</a>.  The trick here is to remove the grill portion and just set the oven right over the burner, it prevents the grill from melting and doubles as a nice wind break on the burner.  I have given up hope on the thermometer, so I typically just set a medium flame and monitor the contents until they're done.\n\nThe grate can be set at 3 heights.  Higher is better in my opinion, helps prevent burned bottoms, which I've had a couple times.  I'd also recommend a dedicated cookware set, I bought the Farberware set&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Farberware-Nonstick-Bakeware-4-Piece-Toaster-Oven-Set-Gray/dp/B008NPUTFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Farberware Nonstick Bakeware 4-Piece Toaster Oven Set, Gray</a>.  Make sure you have a good oven mitt too so you can pull out hot pans.\n\nI deducted a star because the details are lacking.  As I said, the thermometer is way off, the washer behind the door knob has already fallen apart on me, and the latches to hold it together are really easy to bend.  This isn't a new product, so I'd like to see Coleman up the quality a bit, maybe bump the price $5 or so, and call it good.\n\nIt packs small enough that it's always with us when car camping.

Any tears will significantly impacts the light output.  Otherwise it is plenty bright doesn't use much fuel.  More importantly for me is how quiet it is even when turned all the way up.

It's sooooo darned sexy !!\n\nOK, so we have had ours about seven years or so. We bought it when we were still tent camping, and now we use it with our pop-up camper. We could not be much happier with any cooler. You need to make one improvement as soon as you buy this, but it's so inexpensive, I still have to give this 5 stars. I'd give it 6 if I could. Go to your nearest big box home improvement store and buy a small roll of white adhesive backed 1/4\" X 1/4\" foam gasket by Frost King or similar manufacturer. Clean the groove in the lid with a solvent like Mineral spirits or similar. Peel the backing off the gasket and stick the gasket into the groove in the lid, working your way around to  the back where you started. Cut the gasket so its essentially one continuous seal, leaving as small of a gap between start and finish as possible. Now when you close the lid you will have a virtually air tight seal.\n\nWe go camping a week, or sometimes eight days at a time. Before we leave I go to the grocery store and buy 2 five lb. pieces of block ice to put in the bottom. If you have the freezer space, you could make some block ice at home and save the 4 or 5 bucks. After placing the block ice one either side of the bottom of the cooler, I add our weeks worth of food.... bacon, dogs, burgers, bacon, milk, butter, bacon, steak, bacon, you name it ! Then on top of the food I add regular ice, which I make at home, though sometimes we buy it bagged at the store. This cooler keeps ice 8 days or more this way....... no kidding ! I'm so completely impressed. I have left the cooler closed after returning home and had some of the block ice still in it over 9 days.\n\nYes, I also grew up camping with a 1960s original steel belted Coleman cooler and, yes, I'll admit the quality of the vintage coolers was better. Thicker steel, better latch, screw on O-ringed drain cap, and built in bottle opener. Believe me, I will get that ole Coleman from my big brother one day !! It will be mine...... oh yes, it will be mine !!! But the reality is, the 'new' steel  belted coolers are what we can go out and buy today, and this one is great.

Installing the mantle, burning it, and placing the globe on all went quickly and easily.

We used to take the big and bulky Coleman lanterns, double mantle, as we thought the more light the better.\n\nIt's been years taking that. Products have changed, and so have we. I have tried other lights, like some of the many LED or fluorescent lanterns, big and small. Most, or actually all, of them collect dust in the basement. Never have liked the quality of light from the LED, nor the archaic by now fluorescent. LED's have become better, but not so much the color characteristic of the light - too whitish/blue.\n\nSo, I returned to a favorite light we used more than 20 years ago, the Mighty-Lite I think it was called. Basically, it was the same as this light, but with the advantage of the ignition piezo. I like it because it is compact, easily packed in its box, and into the camping box. It certainly doesn't compete in sheer light output like the big ones, and doesn't hiss aloud, but one doesn't have to shield their eyes either.\n\nI think the quality is nice, not a cheap looking/feeling product. The ignition works fine. We either hang it over the camping table, or on it, or anywhere one wants to put it. Mantels are hard to find in local sporting goods stores, even REI's flagship store here in Seattle. Save yourself looking for them - buy them online, and buy 4 or more to keep in the box as mantles can be damaged easily with too much bouncing, knocking around.

Not the cheapest available, but I knew Mom would get a kick out of the old-style looking Coleman in a modern battery version.  That was 8 years ago.  The lantern has probably seen a maximum of 12 hours of use, if that.  It functioned beautifully until the batteries leaked.  I know that is not the fault of Coleman, but I would guess it is not a terribly atypical problem. They were Duracell, but still, batteries will leak over time.  I cleaned up the leaked batteries and found one of the terminals to be badly corroded.  I cleaned up the terminals, still, the circuit could not be completed.\n\nI decided that the part needed to be replaced so went to the Coleman site.  There are replacement parts for this lantern, but not the battery holder (which is a little plastic housing with terminals; you put the batteries in it and slide the whole thing into the base of the lantern).  I called CS and was helped by a very nice man but all he could tell me is that the part is discontinued and not available.  This renders the other barely used and fully functional parts useless.\n\nSo here we have a lantern still on the market and a critical part, one that may be easily damaged by faulty batteries, is discontinued.  I have white gas Coleman lanterns from 1950 that are still fully functional!  How wasteful and shortsighted of Coleman to not continue to provide critical replacement parts for a lantern still on the market today.\n\nI will be replacing this lantern with an LED model from another company; I simply cannot support a company that supports this kind of built-in obsolescence.  Our landfill does not need this kind of needless waste.  Simply irresponsible behavior by a company that makes its money off of people who love the outdoors.

On full brightness it's about half as bright as a 2-mantle lantern - which is quite adequate for many purposes. But it's gas consumption is also half that of a 2-mantle lantern, so you can really stretch the fuel when you turn the light down low. According to the label, a tank lasts 12 hours at full output, or 18 at reduced output. I was without power for 10 days after Hurricane Sandy when there were no gas bottles to be found anywhere. I only had a few, so I was very happy to have this little gas miser. I had no problem installing the mantle but, like another reviewer, I reduced the rating one star for workmanship. The lamp does not sit quite straight on the gas bottle and the globe is not centered within the wire guard. An additional concern is that this lantern hangs from a rather short chain rather than a hardened wire hoop like the larger lanterns. I reduced the rating an additional star because the chain gets so hot that you can't touch it without receiving a severe burn. Moreover, anything it hangs from might be singed or ignited, so you'll need to operate it in a support ring on a flat surface. While I appreciate the effort to make this lantern as portable as possible, the conventional wire hoop is an indispensable safety feature.", "summary": "One-Mantle Compact is a real gas miser!", "unixReviewTime": 1352246400}

I agree with other reviewers that the threads could have been made stronger, but then it is an inexpensive unit.  Evidently to keep the weight down, and for corrosion resistance, the base is made of a zinc alloy.  That is all  good, but a cast-in steel thread or a helicoil could have been employed in the design.\n\nThe instructions were very sketchy.  It says to \"install the mantle\".  Uhh, this is my first lantern, my first mantle.  By the way, what is a mantle?  Anyway, I just slipped it over the post and hoped for the best.  There were no strings to tie.  And the product description says that to light, you must use matches (a lighter).  However, the unit I got has a piezo-electric starter, which so far works nicely.  And of course, since I did not know how to install the mantle, I thought the electrodes for the starter (which were not supposed to exist) might have been a place to tie-off the strings that appear on the photos but did not exist on the product.\n\nIt was hard to get the mantle to light the first time, and I even blew the lid off (That was scary, but cool).  But subsequently, the starter works very nicely.  I ordered a lighter for it, but I won't be using it.\n\nThe lantern is small and light weight.

It was not windy.  The foil didn't really seem to help much.  Nonetheless, the salmon cooked after 35 minutes.  Therefore, my initial impression is that it may be a challenge to cook other items such as baking a potato.\n\n5/10/14 Update:  On my second use of the oven, I had much greater success.  Using the same two burner stove with both burners on, I got the oven to 350-375 degrees.  I cook a medium size potato in 1 hour and a piece of salmon in 15 minutes.  I did not change anything from the first time but the weather was warmer.  It seems the weather conditions an play a big part in how the oven functions.\n\n8/1/14 update:  Baked thin crust pizza.

While we have only used it on one trip so far, it performed well for what it is, and can be improved upon with a little knowledge and pre-planning.  First of all, several reviewers have mentioned how this oven cooks at a higher temp than the simple temperature guage reads.  This seems to be true for mine as well.  I am guessing based on cook time, that at a reading of 350 degrees, the oven was closer to 400 or a bit higher.  Even checking the rolls a few minutes earlier than the earliest cook time at 400 degrees, the bottoms got a bit burned at 350 degrees.  Try cooking at a lower temperature and taking your time to avoid brown or crusty roll/buscuit/cornbread bottoms.  Unless your guage is closer to true temps than mine, you would be better off to assume the reading is 25-50 degress cool, and cook accordingly.  Another tip is to move foods that will fit to one of the top two racks when cooking.  This can also help the top side of your baked goods heat up a little better and more evenly with the bottom of the pan.  Finally, use as thick and heavy a pan as will fit, and/or locate a small round or small rectangular pizza stone that will fit inside on the bottom of the oven to help regulate the heat intensity and hold temperature better when opening the door to check progress.  With just a little effort, this Coleman Camp Oven can work pretty well, despite its light weight and construction.  Also folds down flat for easy transporting.", "summary": "A great addition to any camping outing", "unixReviewTime": 1378944000}

It does work just like a home oven and fits neatly on my Coleman camp stove.  Biscuits come out nicely browned, and I made a pretty decent lasagna in it.  The temperature gauge works well, as does the little door latch.  The oven rack is adjustable, so that between regulating your oven flame and the rack height you can get pretty decent results.  Setting it up and tearing it down only takes a few seconds once you get the hang of it.  It should go without saying that you'll want to let it cool down before trying to stow it.  (Duh....)

After searching around for the best price I settled on purchasing the green colored cooler (which was the cheapest at the time) from Amazon. As a prime eligible purchase, it arrived two days later in perfect condition. Absolutely no dings, scratches, or dents like other reviews mention. It was perfectly packaged in factory boxes.\n\nAPPEARANCE\n\nThe cooler is plastic encased in steel. The colored portion you see is steel whereas the white portion is plastic. Some people seem to believe this cooler is all steel. It is not. It is steel belted as the description clearly states. The latch is metal and plastic. The handles are also metal but with plastic grips. The cooler's appearance is stylish. Also, there is NO bottle opener on this version of the cooler. Some reviews allude to the presence of a bottle opener on the outside of the cooler. There is certainly not one on the version I ordered.\n\nFUNCTIONALITY AND USE\n\nHands down this is the best cooler I have ever owned. I take a lot of road trips and travel a lot for work and used to carry along an old generic plastic cooler with me to keep snacks, water, and soda. This cooler has replaced my old beat up travel buddy. It fits nicely in the back of my Ford Escape and has more then enough storage space for meats, cheese, bread, yogurt, fruit, beer, and ice. I can stock it with enough food for a 3-5 day trip easily. The cooler keeps ice for about two to three days outside of extreme temperatures. Two or three two liter bottles of ice are enough to keep everything cold for at least 2 says. If necessary, the ice can be supplemented with a bag of two from the motel to get you through the last day or two of your trip. I do not use the chemical ice packs (except one small one, see below), but they might last a little longer.\n\nNow just one thing to consider before you purchase this item. The cooler can get heavy especially when fully loaded. Of course it depends on what you put in the cooler, but I have loaded mine up to what was probably more then fifty pounds. That can be a lot of weight to carry especially longer distances. Unless you are a large burly man don't plan on carry this cooler, fully loaded, around all day long. (The plastic grips do a good job of stopping the handles from cutting into your hands when carrying and it is on the heavy side). To get around this limitation, I keep a small cold pack in the cooler and a small insulated bag I got as a freebie at a convention. Whenever I need to take something from the car to a different location and do not want to lug the entire cooler I just place what I need in the insulated bag with the cold pack.\n\nTIPS\n\n1. Don't waste your money buying bagged ice at convenience stores. Fill recycled two liter bottles 3/4 way full of water and freeze them. Use these bottles as ice packs. It will not only save you the mess of melted ice, but also a few dollars because you won't have to buy ice.\n\n2. Make sure to chill everything that will go in the cooler at least overnight. This will help extend the life of the ice in the cooler.\n\n3. It is useful to keep something like a bottle opener or cork screw in your cooler. Even a small folding knife can be a lifesaver when you need to cut open a package or some food.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis cooler is well worth the money. Yes, you can find cheaper alternatives in stores and online. But, the value of this cooler cannot be surpassed. You may save a few dollars by buying a generic plastic cooler, but those savings will quickly be lost with all your ice purchases and loss of food due to heat.", "summary": "Great Cooler, Excellent for Roadtrips", "unixReviewTime": 1379289600}

I have sent this pump to hell and back - several times.  We're campers and boaters and my kids are outdoor freaks - air mattresses, inflatable pools, bounce houses, intertubes, water islands, backyard, and on and on - too much.  I used to lug around an air compressor with me everywhere, and was surprised to find this thing pumps out substantially more air than a 120psi high pressure air compressor.  Like the other reviewer said - it's just a fan - not made for high pressure, but it IS made for high velocity.\n\nThis pump has ran like a champ since the day we bought it.  We take it on the boat, in the motorhome, and it has a permanent spot in my garage next to the compressor.  I use it for everything.  It gets tossed into storage bins, left outside, fallen on the ground a few times, rolls around in the back of the truck, take it down to the sand, etc.  It's been beat up about as much as anything could get beat.\n\nMine has an 18\" extender hose on it which looks like it's been removed from the product since I bought mine - too bad.  I always use the hose and I think I would be bummed out if I lost it.\n\nAfter 5 years, I can hear the motor finally conking out.  It's not dead yet, but I can't risk being stranded without it - it's way too valuable.  Because we do have so many inflatables and some of them are really, really big, I'm going to step it up and try out the Kwik Tek High Pressure this time around.  I'll keep the Coleman until it dies completely, but I'm curious to see if the Kwik Tek can fill the Coleman shoes.\n\nI feel an obligation to offer my support for this little champ.  It did really, really great, and if my Kwik Tek disappoints, I'm back to the Coleman for sure.\n\nIf you're looking for a GREAT pump and can't decide what to get, I highly recommend the Coleman - for the price, durability, and function, it's a winner.", "summary": "This thing is awesome - lake, river, mountains, camping, and around the house.", "unixReviewTime": 1337904000}

In these challenging conditions, the baking can have hot spots where four biscuits cooking at the same time might have two perfect and two burned.\nGetting the tops of food to brown without burning the bottom takes a lot of experience and is something I have not mastered.\nSo, the oven is not perfect, but that is all part of the camping cooking experience - to try to achieve perfection in more challenging environments.\n\nYou can enhance the performance of the oven by draping a couple sheets of aluminum foil around the oven when using it.\nThe Coleman oven does expand the camp menu significantly. Now you can have pizza at camp, which is a novelty. Instead of griddle cakes, you can have muffins. Instead of fried eggs, you can have quiche. If you have picky eaters or new campers, the Coleman oven can bring some familiarity and comfort by offering foods typically enjoyed at home.\n\nThe Coleman oven is a fun device that adds a bit of a thrill for both the cook and the outdoor diners.

I was certain that a little aluminum box could not function as an oven. But recently, we were embarking on a 10-day camping trip, and I was going to need to bake while we were there.  I am pretty adept at baking with coals from a campfire or a charcoal fire, but on the trip in question, there was a burn ban in effect.  What to do?  I got on Amazon and read reviews about the Coleman Camp Oven, and decided that if my original opinion was correct, Coleman wouldn't still be making this little gem.\n\nI purchased the oven and it arrived when promised.  We took it to the campground, and were totally amazed at how beautifully it worked.  We baked brownies, biscuits, potatoes, cornbread and even gluten-free hamburger buns and rolls.  Everything was wonderful. The oven was easy to set up and use.  But it is not like baking at home in your regular oven.\n\nTips you should know:\n  > Only use the oven on a camp stove.  Try to get your stove as level as possible.\n  > Start warming it up with a low flame, and increase the stove flame as the oven begins to pre-heat.\n  > Plan to use small bakeware.  Coleman suggests 8x8 pans. Here are some products that we found worked well:\n  *&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Nordic-Ware-Toaster-Oven-Baking-Sheet/dp/B00004RFS9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Nordic Ware Toaster Oven Baking Sheet</a>\n  *  Ekco mini muffin pan for 12 muffins\n  *&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Fox-Run-Set-of-Four-English-Muffin-Rings/dp/B0000CFME7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Fox Run Set of Four English Muffin Rings</a>&nbsp;(for the burger buns) on the baking sheet\n  *&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/MSR-Blacklite-Fry-Pan/dp/B000FBYNIE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">MSR Blacklite Fry Pan</a>\n  *  8x8 foil pan\n  > After your food is in the oven, you really need to watch the temperature gauge from time to time.  The longer it bakes, the more likely you will need to adjust the stove flame to regulate the temperature inside the oven.  This is NOT set-it-and-forget-it baking.\n  > We found that timing was pretty close to baking at home, as long as the temperature was constant.\n  > Try not to peek too often.  Peeking lowers the internal temperature.  Look when you need to & that's all.\n  > Clean up spills (outside and inside) as soon as the oven cools.  Don't let gunk bake on during the next use.\n\nThe oven folds up quickly when it is time to pack up.  We keep it in its original box, and it is ready to go!\n\nI still love the thrill of accomplishment of baking using a campfire, but this little oven is a great addition for those times when a fire is not convenient.\n\nMay we all have many years of excellent campground baking!

That's a serious camp kitchen even Alton Brown would appreciate. As far as this oven goes, it's always fun to use. I've had great success with tube cookies, rolls and croissants as well as brownies and quick bread mixes even at high altitude.  I've baked a breakfast casserole just below treeline. 6/13 we baked cornbread to go with the fresh trout.  7/6 I baked brownies with it outside because I didn't want to heat up the house. This is no Viking Range. This is a rudimentary folding metal box, but it works.  Baking with this can be an active sport and you have to pay attention.  The thermodynamic properties of aluminized steel are beyond the scope of this review, but suffice it to say that one should not initially turn the burner on full blast or the box will not heat evenly and could warp.  Likewise, one should not place this directly over a camp fire.  For campfire cooking, get a dutch oven.  You can make great things in those too.  For this oven, I keep the burner low at first and let it all heat up slowly to about 200.  I then turn up the burner and let it slowly rise to about 375.  It then requires adjusting the stove burner every few minutes to keep the temperature even.  By \"even\" I mean between 350 and 400. I haven't warped it yet.  I looked at the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Coleman-InstaStart-Portable-Oven/dp/B000W4TH30/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Coleman InstaStart Portable Oven</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Camp-Chef-Camp-Oven/dp/B0013LLSZG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Camp Chef Camp Oven</a>, but this simple box can't be beat for portability.  I can carry three burners, a griddle, pots, hoses, propane and this oven in far less space than one of those ovens takes up. Maybe this winter, I'll make a cover to increase the oven's efficiency.  I thought about using aluminized fiberglass&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/something-like-this/dp/B001G7BXJI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">~something like this~</a>&nbsp;or simply just laying a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Silicone-Bake-Mat/dp/B000FPZ2YO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Silicone Bake Mat</a>&nbsp;over it. In addition to the GSI pots and pans, we also have some silicone bakeware because it's lightweight and smashable. We don't bring this oven on every camping adventure, but there is something really fun about this little \"easy bake oven\".  P.S. It's generally a good idea to keep the camp kitchen away from one's sleeping tent.  That's not always possible in developed campgrounds.  We keep our camp clean, lock it all up at night and have never had a bear or raccoon problem.  It's work, but organization is the key.

I was camping in the Rockies recently, and had to set up my tent on very hard ground, and these were the best stakes for the job. I couldn't even get the little metal stakes that came with my tent to go into the ground, and the larger yellow plastic stakes got all bent up. I wound up going out and buying a dozen more of these big stakes, which are basically nails with green hooks on top. (The green hooks are kinda flimsy, unfortunately.)\n\nThe mallet is nice for pounding in the small metal or plastic stakes, but pounding the big metal stakes into hard ground did leave some scars in the mallet's rubber head. It'd be nice if one side of it had a metal cap or something.\n\nThe stake-puller is basically too weak to pull out any stakes that you can't just pull by hand, although it's nice to use so you don't strain your hands. It's completely worthless for pulling stakes from hard ground, and will just bend until it's wrecked. I'm going to buy a small crowbar instead.\n\nThe dustpan is pretty flimsy. Mine immediately cracked along its edge, if I didn't receive it that way. It's also pretty difficult to put back in the bag.\n\nAll in all, it's a cheap set, but you're basically just getting a decent mallet, 4 good stakes, and an occasionally-convenient stake puller.

It's a heavy, well-made burner best suited for car camping where size and weight are not big concerns.  A major advantage of this burner is the low cost and wide availability of the 16 oz. propane canisters that power it. You get far more bang for your fuel buck with this stove, as compared to stoves using the smaller isobutane canisters. At my local big box store, a 16 oz propane canister costs about $2.50, whereas an 8 oz. isobutane fuel canister costs $5.  Twice the fuel for half the cost is never a bad thing.  Propane canisters also last a long time and are widely available.\n\nLighting this burner is easy.  Simply turn the knob to release the gas and provide a spark (manually), and you're cooking. The simplicity of this burner also has advantages in reliability. As for cooking performance, this stove excels at boiling water and tasks that require a high flame.  The major flaw is that this stove doesn't have a setting that I would describe as truly low.  If you're cooking foods that are prone to sticking or burning on thin camping cookware, you will find that this stove burns too hot even on the lowest setting.  A couple times I've made pancakes on camping trips, and I had to hold my pan above the stove to avoid burning, even on low.  It hasn't been a problem on most foods, but the lack of a very low setting can be troublesome.  I'd recommend checking out the Stansport burner here on Amazon, or the Ozark Trail brand burner sold at Walmart.  I believe both will do a better job cooking at low temp.\n\nOther than that, this is an inexpensive, reliable, and well-made burner that works great. If simmering or low-flame performance is a concern for you, I would pass on this stove.", "summary": "Great burner for cooking at high temperature.  Not great on low", "unixReviewTime": 1407888000}

I've had mine four years now, and it still works like new.  I recently loaned it to a friend who says he is now going to buy one, so I thought I'd see if Amazon still carries it and I read some reviews.  I was shocked by some of the critical comments I read.\n\nThis stove heats water very quickly, even at high altitudes (though water will not heat as quickly at 10,000 feet as it will at sea level with any stove!)  Compared to a white gas stove or a Jetboil, this stove does heat slightly more slowly, but the difference is negligible and not worth the $100+ difference in price and putting up with the delicate craftsmanship of the others.  This Coleman is solid and durable.\n\nThe head has many small holes, or jets for the flame to ensure a regular, evenly-distributed level, adjustable with clicks on the dial from high to very low simmering to off, with a couple more stops in between.  The design of the burner shields the flame from any wind, so in all but the most windy conditions it works fine without any additional shielding.  Mine simmers perfectly, with a very small flame.  Some reviewers here complained that the simmer is too strong, so they may have a defective unit.  If I were to design a stove, I would design the flame control as utilitarian as this one is.\n\nThe burner easily separates from the tank and base to split up the load for hiking.  The tanks can be found for just a few dollars, and Coleman claims a tank will last for more than two hours on high or nine hours on low, which is plenty to cook many meals and heat water for cleanup.  I've used it to prepare all meals for a three-day backpacking trip for six people at 9,000 feet, and I didn't use up a single tank. I suggest starting with a full tank (or two, depending on length of trip) backpacking, and keeping partial tanks to use on camping trips, where having extra tanks is not an issue.\n\nFor the price, this is a steal.  It's a very good stove for backpacking and for camping, though a little heavy for the hiker.  Not a problem for a group, however, to distribute the load.  Remember, when you're a couple days in at 10,000 feet, you want a good, reliable and durable stove like this - and not a finicky white gas or special-canister, overpriced butane stove.", "summary": "Best Bang For The Buck Available", "unixReviewTime": 1396569600}

The discomfort it can cause is sometimes unreal. Also, the hoodie (that the blanket tucks into when stored) makes for a slightly smaller and less open-faced opening than I would like.\n\nFor picnics, I would recommend purchasing a small sized neet sheet to place the food on as there is simply not enough room for two people and food containers.\n\nThe choice is in your hands now, may everything work out and you enjoy this item as much as I do.", "summary": "Keep one at home and one in every car you own", "unixReviewTime": 1222732800}

Yes, the base is the size it is in the pic. The burner is wide so your pans don't fall off. And the regulator sticks out so it's bulkier to pack. It sits high (just like in the pic) so if somebody wobbles a picnic table it will tip over. And no, it's not designed for backpacking... (do people know they also have to pack a bulky bottle to go with it?)\n\nBeen using this for two Summers now. It's a breeze to set up. No built-in ignitor is fine by me - the less crap and gizmos they put on these things the less that will go wrong and the less you rely on said crap and gizmos. It will boil a large pot of coffee in 5 minutes at 10,000 feet. A 12\" pan sits just fine unattended on the large oversized burner but you have to stir more often from the middle - out. 10\" pans are perfect.

It doesnt fit over the case itself, but will keep the entire system dry in a deluge until you can break it down.\n\nI would have liked to have seen metal hardware, but the impact-resistant plastic slider, quick-release swivel and diamond-shaped plastic buckle work well for me.  Im not planning on taking the HWOD on a lengthy hike so Im good to go with this.  The double zipper (synthetic) glides easily and has silicone covers on the zipper pulls, which makes for easy handling.  Theres a textured, sliding shoulder strap that I can easily adjust.  The strap itself can also be adjusted, a great feature for an assortment of users.\n\nOn either side of the bag I can store propane tanks, two on each side, or a combo of one tank and matches.  The back of the bag has a large breathable mesh pocket on the back for whatever extras I might decide to tote along.  Its actually quite roomy and I can put quite a bit of stuff in there.  The fabric is water-resistant, but not waterproof. This case probably isn't something Id be leaving out in the elements, but will keep the Coleman HWOD clean and is perfect for storage.\n\nAs far as cases go, Id say comparatively the price point is quite good considering how well-made it is.  If I hadnt purchased this case, Im not quite sure where Id store the Coleman.  There are a fair amount of pieces that need to be tucked away and the case is perfect for that.  The inside of the case is lined and I can easily wipe it down.

Not a bad thing though.  If you want to be able to turn the water on and off throughout your shower experience without having to turn the unit on and off, you can install a valve on the hose.  But you must be sure to install a bypass valve that allows the water to go somewhere, otherwise you WILL burn up your pump.  The water needs to continually flow.  Best way for me was to follow example of a very helpful you tube vide (guy in garage) where he used an open mouthed jug instead of the bladder bag it comes with.  He rigged his system with a bypass valve that routed the water back to the jug when not spraying through the nozzle. Not only does this recycle your water so you don't waste any from letting in spill on the floor when not using it (soaping up), but it saves your pump AND sends heated water back to the water source where your thermostat senses it.  Guess what happens?  You burn less gas heating water because the reccyling effect sends hot water back to the source and you end up with a bucket of hot water pretty much set to the temperature you desire.  CAn't beat this product at all.  Read all the positive reviews that offer lessons learned.  If you follow their examples and advice, you will definitely enjoy this product.  Mine did not leak anywhere BECAUSE I did not block water flow.  Blocking water flow with a simple on off valve instead of a bypass valve causes pressure to build up in the pump and in the unit.  You have to imagine that building up pressure in anything is not good.  Be sure to rig a three way bypass system that allows water to flow in one way and out two ways (nozzle line or second line that runs back to water source or wherever else you want it to go.  Enjoy this product because you can.  Also, the best way to use this product for us was in a two-sided shower tent.  We had the unit propped up on a simple stool on the dry side, near the door, so we could easily reach out of the shower side and make water temperature adjustments.  Having it outside the stall like the guy in the you tube video did not work for us as we could not control the water temperature on the fly.  With a recirculating water setup, you are going to want to have this level of control because the hot water will return to the jug and you may get some of that back doubly hot unless you turn down your temperature setting just right.  Plus, the space a double stall affords just makes your outdoor camping shower experience that much more pleasant, day or night (battery operated lanterns inside stalls).", "summary": "Not a bad thing though", "unixReviewTime": 1444262400}

It worked fine right out of the box.  For my purpose (heating a tent or a small bedroom in case of a power outage), I'd buy it again (and the price is right).  BTW, the Winter temps in northwest WA are usually pretty mild at sea level, so although the 1500 BTU output isn't much, it is all I need.\n\nThe very first time I lit my unit, I was puzzled why it took 5 or 6 clicks of the insta-start spark to light it, even though Coleman predicts this in their instructions.  By telling you to start clicking the spark right after opening the valve, I suspect Coleman is making sure you don't let a large amount of propane build up before you hit the button.  In other words, I suspect it takes the same amount of time to click the starter 5 or 6 times as for the unit to build up enough propane to light.  When it does, there is a small poof of blue and yellow flame.  True, if you waited a few minutes after you open the valve to click the starter, one click might be enough to light the unit, but you might also lose your eyebrows (or worse).\n\nOne thing for sure... run your heater outside or maybe in your garage for a LONG time when it is brand new.  In fact, I'd say use up a whole container of propane to break it in.  The reason for this is that the smell this heater puts out when it is new is nasty!  Ever get a rug stuck in the rotating brush of your vacuum cleaner, and the rubber drive belt starts to smoke?  Well, it's like that smell TIMES TEN!  I couldn't find any mention of the odor or warnings about toxicity in the Coleman booklet, so Coleman must not think is is harmful.

These are very heavy-duty tent stakes, suitable for a very large tent, or for securing a tent that is going to be in very windy weather.  They are big and heavy, way too much for lightweight or weight-conscious camping.\n\nThat being said, in the three-odd years I've had these stakes, they go in and they stay in.  This is for hand placement or a stomp with a boot.  If you're using a hammer, and you run these things down into the earth, they are as secure as you can get, and it's going to take a tornado to take your tent away.  But, surprisingly, they have always come out very easily.  They usually come out with a simple hand pull, or I just hook one stake into the other, and they come out with this method.\n\nI have experienced absolutely no bending with these stakes.  They have not even had their blades bent or warped from emplacement or removal.  They are very tough, very sturdy, and will retain their shape.\n\nMy only complaint is that they stain very easily and quickly.  After one campout there was considerable staining on all stakes from contat with earth.  They always clean up easily in hot water with a quick brush.  They still work fine, and still have not rusted, but they are very blotchy, as the staining is black/dark gray.  This staining has had no effect on performance.\n\nBottom line: for car camping or other equipment-heavy camping, or for use where your tent or fly or shelter needs to be secure, this is a great purchase, well worth the price.

It is true that it takes some guesswork to assemble the paddles correctly. Basically, the instructions don't explain that the closed end of the poles is where you attach the paddles; this creates a seal and then water doesn't seep into the poles.\n\nAnyway, since it was the first time, it probably took 10 minutes or more to inflate but the process was very simple. The air chambers are numbered so you know which part to inflate first.\n\nIt's a little tricky closing the plugs without letting all the air out (because it is built to deflate quickly). My sister-in-law made the smart decision of keeping the pump running and then quickly pulling it out and closing the plug. In any case, it's very manageable.\n\nThen we took it out into the pond, on a day windy enough for whitecaps. We could not believe how well it tracked. It actually has two skegs, which my quite expensive, \"real\" kayak lacks.\n\nThe paddles do drip but again, compared to my hundred-dollar \"real\" paddle (the price of this entire inflatable package), they do an excellent job. Just plan to get a bit wet (bathing suit bottoms recommended!).\n\nMy 82-year-old dad, who has been avoiding tippy canoes and can't get in my \"real\" kayak at all, came with me and he LOVED it. It was so nice to be able to get him back on the water again.\n\nMy six-year-old did not come with me---it was really too windy---but I tried both the front and back seats myself and I feel confident that she will be able to sit very securely in the front seat. Even as the waves bounced us up and down the kayak felt very sturdy.\n\nI really can't say enough good things about this kayak.

As it turned out, I didn't really need to use it, but in case it rained I wanted to have it with me.\n\nAs usual, the shipping from Amazon was speedy, and I received the bag in under a week. Unfortunately, I wish I had taken more time to look at my local Bass Pro shop first. This bag is around a 20oz bag, which I found to be almost too small for what I needed/wanted it for. It's also a very stiff bag. The little loops that are attached are nice, as is the translucent see-thru nature of the plastic. But in terms of overall construction quality, it's not as nice as a 30oz bag I could have gotten locally for around $12.\n\nHonestly, I'm not 100% certain that this bag would be the best if there were a chance of it getting submerged or sitting in standing water. After putting items in mine and rolling it, I could still push air out. That tells me the seal wasn't very solid/complete. Conversely, I have a small \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/SealLine-Baja-Dry-Bags-Spring-2010/dp/B0009RNVPA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">SealLine Baja Dry Bags (Spring 2010)</a>\" bag that I can NOT do that on. And the bag I tried out at Bass Pro could have doubled as a pillow with the way it held air.\n\nIn the end, it's caveat emptor. You get what you are paying for with this bag. If you are looking for something cheap and simple just to keep the rain or mud off of your stuff, then this might be a good choice for a relatively low price. But if you are looking for something that is more durable and air-tight, I'd encourage you to take a look at some of your other options, both on Amazon and at stores like Bass Pro or Cavenders.", "summary": "An OK bag for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1256688000}

One end of the adapter is a POL connection. It is a male connection. You counter clockwise screw it into your 20, 30, 40, etc. propane tank.. The other end of the adapter is a male 1\" X 20 throwaway propane canister threading.

This adapter will fit into ANY female 1\" X20 throwaway propane canister threading and not just the 8 feet extension hose. I have the Bernzomatic 5 ft. extension hose and it works great.

The POL screw part is a loose sleeve with a fitted hex nut. It screws in and on easily on both ends. You might need a wrench but I had not problem tightening it by hand. If you only have the POL end of the adapter screwed in and you open the tank valve, no propane should be released.

I received it Wednesday in a very compact box and inside, it had the kayak, instructions, and 2 kayaking oars that came in 7 pieces each. These went together quickly, and come with collars that separate each oar into 3 pieces for easy transport and storage.\n\nWhen I unfolded the kayak for the first time I was really amazed at just how big it is. I'm 6'2\" and my wife is 5'7\". Both of us fit very comfortably and there is probably enough leg room for someone up to about 6'6\" or so to feel really comfortable. There is a storage area in the front and the back that's triangular in shape. We brought along some snacks and drinks in a plastic bag, but I'd be willing to bet you could get a small cooler in there as well.\n\nAs for performance on the water, it worked better than I had expected. We launched from the shore over some floating debris and the sides barely displaced 2\" of water with a combined weight of 320 between us. It was very stable to get into and out of because it's wide and has seems that allow the side air pockets to pivot and stay still while the bottom moves as you move around. It was a little slow over the water because of the same width and it's also because of the width that I have my only gripe. The included oars are a bit short for the size of this boat, which means you are going to get wet if you plan on getting anywhere in a decent amount of time... you are forced to swing the oars over so far that the opposite oar drips right on top of you.\n\nWe did encounter some boat wake, and it took that no problem straight on and at an angle. I would not be surprised if it even took a parallel wake without flipping. It just feels that stable. I wouldn't recommend taking it out in a lot of chop, however... the kayak does move and gyrate a whole lot when you encounter different levels of water.\n\nBlowing up and packing couldn't be any easier. I bought an Ozark Trail large volume hand pump from Walmart to make my life easier, and I was able to fully inflate the kayak in just over 6 minutes from empty. There are numbers on each of the 8 valves that tell you the order to inflate in. Deflating for me was as easy as undoing all of the valves and rolling the kayak one way, then unrolling and rolling the other way. It collapsed on it's own to a size small enough for even the smallest trunk.\n\nI expect to get a lot of use out of the kayak this summer. It's very fast to set up and a lot of fun... just remember that the oars are going to get you wet.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "05 19, 2007", "summary": "Fun and Easy!", "unixReviewTime": 1179532800}

It turns out to be one of the best $100 purchases ever, and I'm using it much more than I had originally thought. I love the ease of rolling it up, tossing it in the car trunk and being ready to hit the water almost anywhere. I've used it in the Gulf of Mexico, in the bay, and little inlets and it handles pretty well, even with a non-paddling passenger. It's a fun way to poke around the wetlands, do some birding, etc.--with its shallow draft you can paddle in literally inches of water. Because it is wider and flatter than most kayaks, the wind will push it a bit, but it's fairly responsive and maneuverable, even fully loaded. Definitely spring for the rechargable inflator, which does the job in less than five minutes. The paddles could be better, but they're OK for the money. This kayak is a great option for someone who'd like to paddle sometimes but doesn't want the hassle of storing a kayak, strapping it to the roof of their car, or dragging it to a launching spot.

Well, this past year, a friend brought along one of these and the difference was staggering. If you turn that dial as high as it goes, you can practically simulate daylight. He put it on a stand and we were able to spot a snake that was, ironically, closest to my lantern. Needless to say, I purchased one of my own the first chance I got.\n\nI prefer this model to the self-ignition version due to the fact that the more hands-on something is, the more proficient one becomes in using it. Also, it will be easier to spot when something is wrong with the unit this way. The last thing one wants to discover is that something has rendered their lantern useless that could very well have been predicted and fixed before the next outing.\n\nInsofar as the base goes, I have done away with the flaps that come with it and fashioned my own out of a paint can. I sprayed it with Rustoleum and then cut a hole in the top to barely accommodate the propane cylinder and flared out the base in order to create a near indestructible base that weighs practically nothing and can be strapped to the outside of a pack without worry about rust. I also went so far as to keep a carabiner on hand to attach to the handle and, along with some 550 cord, I am able to affix it to any tree, should the need arise.\n\nThis has come in handy for those times when I have lost a race against the sun and still have a couple miles to go before making it the distance I had planned to travel for the day before resting. When these times strike, I attach it to a propane hose and keep the tank in my backpack (to better accommodate the weight so I can keep the light held high for longer). I have even, from time to time, attached it to a stick to hold out before me to better show the terrain and judge elevation better.\n\nI keep another one at home (permanently affixed to a hose w/ a stand), along with some 20lb propane canisters for whenever the weather knocks out power. I'll have a strong light source to keep working and have even used it to show my way when shoveling snow at night.\n\nTo the point: This lantern is one of those purchases that will always come in handy. It can be used for emergency home situations and outdoor, alike. Keep an eye on the mantles and when they go on sale, stock up. You may never need all of them, but they will at least be around in case you do.\n\nFinally, a word of WARNING: This lantern can get hot enough to ignite or melt nearby objects. For this reason, it would not be very safe to use in a tent or around combustible items. I have seen people, pinched in an emergency, use this as a tent heater; needless to say, I'd have to be in a very difficult situation before I attempted going down that same route. I definitely wouldn't fall asleep in a tent with this on.", "summary": "Night turned to Day", "unixReviewTime": 1333843200}

For safety reasons it must be taken off, rested on its side, filled, then put back on. Its dead simple, two tabs and notches.\nWith routine maintenance I expect this nearly identical model to last 30 years or more just like the previous one did.\nHighly recommended for those campers who actually enjoy operating machinery.\n\n5 year UPDATE Ive used this several times a year, year round. The valves and gaskets are holding up, and it still essentially operates like new. The metal rusts where exposed, so I suggest repainting the bare spots as needed.

Everything I said in my original review still holds true!\n\nOriginal Review below is still valid\n\nI haven't had this stove long, but I just cooked dinner on it, and did a review.  Go to Youtube, and type in \"themarkfellows2\" and look for my review.  It will be uploaded tonight, and ready for viewing in the morning.  I cooked a large pot of Chicken, Egg Drop soup, and it performed great, with plenty of power from the main burner(I didn't use the auxiliary burner, but I am sure it is fine).  I boiled 8 cups of chicken broth, 2 cups of water, and cooked 2 pounds of chicken, and vegetables, in about 30 minutes.  Start to finish.  The stove, lights, and works very well.  The Auxiliary burner is easy to light, and extinguish.\n\nI used Coleman fuel that was AT LEAST 10 years old, and maybe 20 years old, and left first, in a porch exposed to cold, and heat, and sunlight.  It burned just fine.\n\nI have found Coleman fuel to be Extremely stable.\n\nPropane is more stable, and burns cleaner, but I just can not justify using those little 1 pound bottles, and then chucking them in the trash when they are empty.  It just seems really stupid to me to use those.\n\nIf they have an adapter to make one of those propane stoves use a 20 pound bottle, more power to you.  I will stick with liquid fuel if I can.  It generates much less waste than the 1 pound bottles, and you can get fuel anywhere.  Plus, this can run on gasoline if you wish.\n\nAnyway, back to the stove.  It is great.  It lights easily, has plenty of power, has great fine adjustment on the heat, and burns very steadily after the first five minutes, and the generator heats up.\n\nThis will be a fine stove for my car camping( I already have an MSR Dragonfly for backpacking).\n\nOne big plus was that it was manufactured in the USA.  That means a lot to me, over Chinese goods.\n\nBe aware though, the first couple times you use it, you will likely burn some paint off, so you will smell burning paint fumes a little, if you have the burner turned up high.\n\nAlso, the stove body gets hot, so keep stuff that will melt away from it.\n\nI put a video on youtube, where I cook a pot of soup with 20 year old coleman fuel.  Go to youtube, and look for \"the suburban hippie survivalist\" and look for my video on it.\n\nGood luck!\n\nMark :)", "summary": "Good little stove, with plenty of power", "unixReviewTime": 1333065600}

No problems with shipping or packaging.  I purchased a 1 gallon can of Coleman fuel at WalMart for about $7.  The stove came with a filter funnel which made filling easy.  The stove instructions were a little hard to read but this is a simple product.  I pumped the stove about 40 pumps to pressurize the stove.  I lit the stove and there was very high yellow flames initially so keep your windscreen out of the way so you don't overheat the paint.  I opened up both burners and let it rock for 3-5 minutes.  Soon the wild yellow flame disappeared and I got a nice blue flame.  I turned the stove off and it burned out in 30 seconds.  It is a small cooking area.  If you are hosting a large camp site and plan to be using very large pots and pans you might want to look at the 3 burner.  This would be fine for a small base camp with small to medium size cookware.  This would easily serve well for a 2-4 person camp.  I liked that the instructions were posted on a sticker inside the lid.  They show it being lit with a match but i think it would be safer and easier to use a long lighter if you have one.  WalMart had the stove for $78.00. with tax it would be about $85.00.  It was $88.00 online, $78.00 in store.\n\nOne last but important note.  The instructions say you can use unleaded fuel if necessary.  It is the \"if necessary\" language that bothers me.  That is legal speak for \"you can use unleaded fuel but we prefer you to use Coleman fuel.\"  If that is the case, you might be better off just buying the stove that operates on Coleman fuel.

Certainly much more so than the 1 burner camping stoves you see for backpacking etc. As far as the requiring a match, its actually just simpler that way.

And of course being able to run it on unleaded gasoline in an emergency is a very useful feature for earthquake/ emergency preparedness.  I have actually used my stove for weeks on end while camping. If you are in an emergency situation this will allow you to boil water and still make good hot food when your gas line or electricity is out.\n\nThere is enough space that you can use pretty decent size pots and pans. For instance when I make my spaghetti and italian sausage there is plenty of room to boil the water in a big pot while cooking up the italian sausage in a skillet right next to it.

I remember when I was much younger, waking up on camping trips to hear the sounds of cooking oatmeal, eggs, and sausage on that stove, not to mention hot chocolate. I must have one myself now that I am older and do my own camping more often than the family camping. She's 79 and still organizes a family camping trip every other summer.\n\nAnyways, this stove is very much like the old-school units, escept I think the steel is a little thinner. I think it is sturdy enough though. The Dual Fuel designation allows me to use less expensive gasoline instead of Coleman fuel. My experience with gasoline on this stove is the same as using Coleman fuel. It is easy to light, and as long as I follow the lighting instructions word for word, I don't have any issues with flooding burners or high yellow flames. I like how the windscreen really works, and how the tank stores inside and then the windscreen folds down and closes like a lid, making the stove look like a green metal briefcase.\n\nThis is a must-have for anyone who does car camping or state-park style modern camping.

Been using this one regularly for seven years or so and it's possibly the best single-burner stove I've used for car camping.\n\n Unlike most single-burners, its large footprint, rubber feet and low profile make it very stable, especially with larger pots & pans. This makes it safer than others; important if you've got kids around. Nothing more disappointing than having a nice pot of chili cooking and have it tip over into little Johnny's lap.\n\n Easy to set up and get cooking right away. No liquid fuel to spill, no odor, no pumping or waiting for a generator to heat up. I've used it in windy conditions and it's rarely blown out.\n\n Easy to clean. Many stoves have a lot of exposed parts on top that catch spilled food. This one doesn't. The large painted surface around the burner stays relatively cool, so I haven't had to scrub any burned food. It just wipes off.\n\n Very sturdy. I've used heavy cast iron pots without fear of crushing it. The pot supports go down to the feet rather than into the stove itself.\n\n A few tips:\n\n This stove can simmer fairly well at the lowest setting and has a large diameter burner that spreads the heat heat out better than smaller ones. However, a simple diffuser plate (many available here on Amazon) on top of the burner helps this (and most other type) stove keep from scorching food in the center of the pan. Very useful if using thin aluminum camping pots.\n\n A little powdered graphite applied to the threads of the propane fitting makes it easier to thread the bottle into it.\n\n Protect the fittings of the propane tube assembly form dirt/damage. I keep the assembly in a ziplock bag. Be careful not to cross-thread the bottle when screwing it into the fitting.\n\n Propane isn't as cheap as liquid Coleman fuel for the same heat output, but at ~$2 for a 1# propane bottle that will generally last for many hours' cooking, not bad. No need for the expensive little proprietary cans that other stoves use. Can also be hooked up to a larger tank if need be.\n\n This is a great item for anyone wanting to simplify their camp cooking.

So, I haven't actually used it. It does appear however, to be of the same quality as the two burner Coleman I do own. This 1-burner model is well made. It's definitely designed in a way that could accept either a small coffee pot or other camping pot all the way up to a nice sized cast iron skillet or a huge regular sized pot of water usually used for boiling spaghetti or the like. I went with this product because of its stability. I love the low profile and wide base. It will really give a nice pot of chili the stability you need when cooking and stirring. The other models that screw directly onto the burner seemed like they'd be top heavy or would need a really level surface to be able to relax a little while cooking. It's got a good weight to it - durable enough to know it'll support what you're cooking, but not so heavy that it's going to be a pain in the ass to take places. This is the perfect burner for the weekend camper, the car camper, the occasional camper....basically any camper that's not going on a 5 day backpacking excursion. It's also a good \"just in case\" burner in case you lose electricity or need something in an emergency situation. I also like that it attaches to the smaller gas tanks that are cheap and convenient to pack and carry. It may not be absolutely wind resistant, but its low profile gives someone with a little ingenuity plenty of options to fashion up some sort of wind barrier if it comes to that. I haven't actually used this yet, but like I said it looks and feels a lot like my two burner Coleman and that one has worked flawlessly for years without any issues whatsoever. It even has the same gas attachment as my other Coleman, so it looks like they just took things and reconfigured for a single burner model. I really can't foresee this model acting up, but I will update as I have a chance to. For the price, I couldn't pass this up. Great value. I only gave it 4 stars because I haven't actually used it yet. So that rating is based on my initial observations and my past experience with Coleman burners.\n\nWhile I don't own any 14.1 oz tanks, I imagine those would work just fine. The 16.9 oz are the commonly featured tank and I know those fit perfectly with this stove. I believe the bushings/threads are the same on the 14.1 oz tanks. I also know they sell 14.1/16.9 oz-to-20 lb tank adapters so that you can hook this puppy up to a 20 lb. tank. So, because the adapter is named with both weights on it, I'd assume both would fit this stove. Those are just my observations on the 14.1 oz tank though.", "summary": "Yep - this will do", "unixReviewTime": 1355356800}

One is that the unit requires a small extension tube to connect to the fuel tank and this needs to be unscrewed and carried separately. The bottom of the stove has lots of room but that is taken up by a rather useless piece of aluminum that could easily have been modified to allow the tank connector to snap into place, so it is not lost in moving the unit around.

I liked the idea of one like this versus ones that sit on disposable tanks since it looks more stable (as well as being able to connect it to a bulk tank if wanted with a hose).  Looking at the online pictures I liked the way this one looked with round bars for the pot support (versus bent sheet metal supports in similar ones) and thought \"That looks better if someone did try to carry such in a back-pack since it won't have knife-blade like edges easily ripping into things\".  So I ordered one up even with seeing some reviews of \"This is bigger than I expected\" thinking it may be ~8-10 inches across versus ~6-8 (and not seeing anyone giving dims on it).  The truth is that the main body is 12 inch diameter at the base, it is almost 14 inches across at the feet (the widest points) and the pot support bars will hold an 11 inch diameter pot with it sitting flat on the horizontal parts of the bars.  So maybe that tells you more about how \"Big\" it really is versus pictures of it alone (that are hard to scale with no comparisons).  This also explains to me why it goes for over $30 versus many single burner stoves going for $15-20 (that I wondered about too before ordering it).\nI'll keep it since having this may be as good or better than many 2 burner stoves (where putting a 11 inch pan on them ends up with almost 1/2 the pan hanging off the edges), but I hope this helps minimize surprises for others of you considering this.", "summary": "A \"Big\" single burner stove", "unixReviewTime": 1306972800}

Once its dissasembled in this manner you can throw it in the sink and wash it like you would any other pan.

I burn very, very easily. My wife goes outside for five minutes and gets a fantastic tan. I'm a little bitter about that, but hey, we all have our shortcomings. Mine is that I crisp instead of tan. Our new apartment is about a 15 minute walk to the beach, and with her being from Virginia Beach, she loves the water. I decided to search around and find something that might spare me the agony of sitting on the beach for more than five minutes, and I found this.\n\nWhy the green color is cheaper than the others is beyond me, but a slight discount is a slight discount, so I went for it. Maybe there's better colors out there, but given the sea of lime green beach shades I've seen so far at the beach, I'd say we're all cheap and want to save what we can. The design is a bit tricky for me. I've put together various tents my whole life, and this one is a bit of a challenge. Personally I think the fabric tube for the cross-tube that goes longways across the shade is much to narrow, and it makes it tricky to get the pole to successfully stay in one piece while you're trying to set up the shade. I'm sure the more I use this the more I'll figure out its quirks, but I wasn't particularly pleased spending a massive amount of time putting this small thing together (and ripping some of the mesh tube) when I've put an 8 person tent together in what seemed like a much shorter amount of time.\n\nThe quality of the shade (other than the narrow pole tubes) is great. We spent several hours in the shade and it was very comfortable. The attached 'flooring' is a nice touch, though sand will get everywhere and if you're wet from the water when you sit down, it'll pool and sand will stick. I think next time we'll place towels down first. The stakes were great quality and I'm thrilled they were metal instead of plastic. The included bags to store everything were also well-made, and with some patience (aka giving my wife the tent and bag) the whole thing did end up fitting back into the storage tote. I will mention that even with the window in the back and the entrance to the tent being open, it does get pretty warm in there. It wasn't unbearable, but I did end up ordering two small battery-operated fans anyway to help circulate some air. I'm sure the majority of people won't need to do that, but if you're like me and you sweat and become very warm easily, then you may want to invest in some cheap fans.\n\nI'm super happy with this so far, and it has absolutely made my trips to the beach much more fun and much less painful, so for that, I'm very grateful!", "summary": "Thank you for saving my skin from certain combustion", "unixReviewTime": 1500595200}

It's well-made, and designed.\n(but the mesh sleeves for the poles should be solid. The curved mesh catches on the metal ferrules, and separates the links).\nWe've been using cabana's for almost 20 years, and love it! This is the biggest? (and 6\" too big for the beach we are headed to, in height and width. Beach police, beware!). If it's too high, I will scoop 6\" of sand out, below it.\nA TRICK for setting it up, solo - take at least 3 medium rubber bands along. When you get the rod through, band the rod to the tab with the grommet on it, so it won't pop out as soon as you turn your back, to work on the other end. SO much easier. I struggled in the living room, on the test run, before I remembered this. The dogs simulated the wind, and other problems on the beach...\nAnd I'm so glad they didn't send the one with the big lantern printed on the sides. That seemed a bit much.\nFor all those who don't like the mesh sleeves - you could cut a long strip of nylon fabric, the length of the pole sleeves, and sew it into a tube - which would go inside the mesh sleeves. You may need  to sew it to the ends of the sleeve, maybe more than that. A pain - but it would eliminate the mesh problem. A small rubber ball, stuck on the fwd end of the pole may help, too. (but the problem is when the ferrules catch, and the segments separate).\nAFTER using the tent, and seeing how wrong the mesh sleeves are for the poles to go thru, I went to Lowes and got 5' of 1/2\"OD plastic waterline. (not pvc). And I glued a cap on one end. Now, I start the tube in the sleeve, then push it the rest of the way through with the pole. Then, pull the tube out the other end This will save the mesh. But really - don't they make designers try these things out??? The mesh will quickly puncture, with the poles, as designed.\nThe tent was nice, with no problems. (you might want to put the filled sand bags in zip-lock bags? They don't hold sand that well). The carrying bag was well made, and the tent fit back in. But what would it cost them to add an inch of material, to make it easier?\nAnother tip - a strip of plastic or cardboard, for when you zip the bag up. This will stop the zipper from grabbing the tent, as you need one hand to pinch the sides together, and one to zip.", "summary": "Set-up trick- and water line", "unixReviewTime": 1500595200}

We didn't want to keep wasting paper, and plastic products. I would give this a 5 star rating but the plates and some cups came chipped with the enamel already wearing off. We contacted amazon and they sent a replacement fast. The replacement arrived today, and the same issue on some of the plates and bowls this time. The plates this time also came with a thick \"drip like gobs\" on the tops of 2 plates. They stick up about a quarter of an inch and run about 4 inches around on the plates. I'm thinking these are just going to be something that will always have an issue, and over time need to be replaced. Our last set was many years old, the enamel wore off after years of use and being banged around eventually started to rust. That's my concern with these ones, and why I wanted them replaced right away. The silverware in this set is wonderful though. They come with a carry case for them, and each have their own place in that case. The knives were great and even cut through grilled steaks with ease, very impressed for what seemed like a butter knive. I have to say though for coleman I was not too impressed with their quality,  it seems to be lacking from what I remember about the brand. I was shocked to turn over each plate, bowl, and cup and see a sticker that said China ok the back. I had assumed that coleman was still a product made in the USA. I was sadly mistaken. I looked up coleman to see what had happened to the quality of the products and this is what I believe has happened.\n\n\"The Coleman Company's headquarters are in Wichita, and it also has facilities in Texas.

Don't expect it to heat a large room or large tent.  But, for the price and the operating cost, you can't beat it.  I also recently ordered an adapter that allows you to refill the 1 lb bottles from a 20 lb tank.

I used it in a well-ventilated 4-person (medium-sized) tent.  The first 2 days were cold and rainy, and I was VERY glad to have brought it.\n\nNow, this heater is not going to make your tent into a sauna on a very cold day, so don't expect to get in the tent and lounge in your skivies like you might do at home!  But after burning for about 10-15 min, it should raise the temperature in your tent several precious degrees making it bareable; even comfortable.  For instance, it did keep me from having to wear my heavy coat while inside the tent, which pleased me.\n\nSince it would certainly heat a smaller, less-vented tent better than a larger, more-vented tent, your results may vary.  As for me, the results were not dramatic, but certainly noticable, and well worth the money spent.\n\nNote: This kind of catalytic heater requires those mini propane tanks.  It works by a chemical reaction between a meshy platinum filter and the burning propane gas, so while there's no obvious propane smell and no open flame, there's still a very hot surface that could catch objects on fire if they are placed directly in front of it for too long.  FYI, when you first light it, you may indeed see an igniting flame, but that is just upon start up.  Once the starting flame vanishes, put your hand gently over the heater - if you feel it eminating warmth, you'll know you've started it successfully.\n\nWarning: Just as the instructions warn you, I do NOT recommend leaving this heater on through the night when you and your family are asleep.  It is both a breathing hazard, and an obvious fire hazard.  But warning stated, I did just that and I didn't have a problem.  I slept very comfortably on a couple cold nights and I didn't die in my sleep. Again, your results may vary.\n\nHowever, I should note that my own tent is extreamly well ventilated, with the entire ceiling being mesh under the rain fly.  In addition, the night was windy, and I could actually feel a breeze of air circulating in my tent.  In truth, if I had brought a less-ventilated, cold-weather tent with me that weekend, the heater may not have been needed at night, but since I was stuck with a drafty tent, I took the calculated risk that this would also lessen the threat.  In addition, I took every possible precaution to ensure that nothing was near the heater before going to sleep.  Even so, it's a risk that I could not blame anyone for not wanting to take.  Also, if you do this, expect the propane tank to be empty by morning.\n\nAll in all, other than the obvious handle-with-care factors, I could not find a downside to this product.  In fact, I could not imagine cold-weather camping without it.  P.S. They also sell a slightly cheaper version, which is the same in every way, except it does not have the self-starting switch, and you start it manually with a lit match.", "summary": "Pleased with performance.", "unixReviewTime": 1165449600}

These retail at most sporting goods stores for between $80-$100.  The optional piezo-electric starter is not needed if you simply keep a lighter handy.\n\nI've used one of these while motorcycle camping for a couple years and it really works well.  It produces enough heat to raise the temperature of my 3-season, 4-man tent about 25 degrees when it dips below 30 outside, even with two screen walls.  That makes the difference between being really comfy and sleeping well, or being restless and waking throughout the night.\n\nThe heater will operate at full power for ~10 hours on one propane cartridge (I've run it that long), so you don't have to worry about it running out of fuel at 4:00 AM.  It operates silently but the heating surface does get very hot.  It will instantly melt/char nylon or other fabrics, so you have to very carefully place this thing away from tent walls, sleeping bags, inflatables, pets and clothes.  It also needs good ventilation, as it consumes a lot of oxygen.  Respect it and be smart and you'll be safe and warm all night...  Coleman understandably recommends not sleeping with it operating, but that's why we buy these things.\n\nI highly recommend that you test run it for a couple hours before using it in an enclosed space.  When new, it can produce a disagreeable odor, kinda like burnt metal and paint.  After being broken in - it's fine.\n\nThe plastic body which surrounds the heater is bulky.  The earlier version of this with a simple wire prop stand was much more compact.

I'm assuming for several safety reasons including possibility of tipping it over. But I bought this item to use at night while camping since that is when it gets cold mostly.\n\nI would recommend looking at the Mr. Heater one as well for around the same price which looks sturdier and has safety features built-in and is approved for indoor use.\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Mr-Heater-F215100-3800-BTU-Indoor-Safe/dp/B001CFRF7I/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1407387059&sr=8-2&keywords=mr+heater\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Mr-Heater-F232000-Indoor-Safe-Portable/dp/B002G51BZU/ref=sr_1_1?s=home-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1406819767&sr=1-1&keywords=mr+heater+buddy+portable+heater\n\nAs far as other safety issues: there are concerns of carbon monoxide poisoning with any device like this, but rv-roadtrips websitie explains the safety an risks involved with catalytic heaters. Which from what I have read, catalytic heaters do not burn with an open flame and this reduces the amount of carbon monoxide and other toxic fumes emitted compared to an open flame heater. BUT, it is NOT the existence of carbon monoxide or toxic fumes which is the danger when using a heater like this indoors, it is the potential for the LACK of oxygen since this also consumes oxygen. So still having a well ventilated space to allow for oxygen to flow into your space is still a must.\n\nsafety info here: http://rv-roadtrips.thefuntimesguide.com/2012/02/catalytic-heaters.php", "summary": "Could have better safety features", "unixReviewTime": 1406764800}

It's the same color as the darker one in the close-up of the valve, and the valve is identical.  I actually paid about ten dollars less than Amazon's posted price at the time of this review.\n\nI'm a bony guy, and really wanted something with a little more loft than my Thermarest SOLite pad (which is a little on the large side when rolled anyway, even though I bought the short version) for bike camping trips.  It had to be reasonably light and packable, and I figured I'd give this a shot, since I could return it if it didn't work.\n\nMy expectations, I admit, were not actually very high.  I've been disappointed by many sleeping pads in the past, and would actually have just purchased one of those small floatation-device style air mattresses if my hubby had not firmly suggested that one of these might offer better insulation and so forth.  I was willing to give it a try, but still worried that my boniness and side-sleeping tendencies could be problematic.\n\nIn practice, this pad significantly exceeded my expectations.  That said, there's a bit of a process involved in getting it to work right:\n\nA) Pre-Inflate.\nAs the manufacturer suggests, before your first camping trip, unroll it, open the valve, and let it sit for as long as possible -- twenty-four hours if you can (I bought mine the day before my trip, so I had to make due with six-ish).  Then deflate it, roll it, close the valve, and pack it.\n\nB) Don't Wait 'Til You're Ready for Bed\nWhen you make camp, set your tent up, unroll your pad, open the valve immediately, and let it do its thing.  Of note, we rolled into camp on our second night only a couple hours before bed.  I set up my tent and pad right away and it was fine.\n\nC) Give It An Assist\nPerhaps most importantly -- give the pad several good puffs by mouth (this, by the way, has been recommended for every single self-inflating pad I've considered -- including much more expensive models).\n\n--\n\nThe style of the valve makes this a bit challenging, but you'll get the hang of it quickly.  You'll want to give it a little more air than you think you need, because it will lose a little as you're screwing the valve shut.\n\nSome users find the tufted design of this pad uncomfortable.  I, on the other hand, feel that the tufted design is exactly what makes it so very comfortable for someone like me.  Where a non-tufted pad might be compressed flat at my bony points, the tufted 'billows' in this pad offer support and relief.  On its first night out, I shoved it into my sleeping bag and slept better than I sleep at home.  That's not hyperbole, by the way -- I really mean it.  I slept better than I normally do at home, even after a comparably-challenging day on the bike.\n\nThere are pads in the world that pack smaller, and there are probably better pads -- and if I were backpacking instead of traveling by bicycle, I might want one of those.  However, for less than fifty bucks, a little finagling makes this pad work just fine.\n\nPros:\n-Tufted design works well for bony people\n-Holds air once inflated\n-Deflates easily and packs reasonably small, for the price\n-Built-in compression straps are great\n-For its price point, offers exceptional comfort\n-Attached pillow can be inflated by mouth or left uninflated.  Your choice.\n\nCons:\n-Some users don't enjoy the tufted design\n-Not entirely 'self-inflating'\n-Inflates a tad slowly\n-Not ideal for backpackers (doesn't pack small enough)", "summary": "Very Good for Some People", "unixReviewTime": 1339027200}

Green", "reviewText": "Upsides: It works.\n\nDownsides: The InstaStart thingy doesn't. No matter how many times I press the button, I see the little spark but apparently not enough propane is in the vicinity of that spark to fire it off. I use a long-snout butane barbecue lighter to light the thing without being barbecued.\n\nIt's not very adjustable. There's low heat. There's high heat. That's it.\n\nThe metal grill on the front gets very hot. You must be very careful where you place this thing so that said grill doesn't contact you, your tent, your dog, your upholstery in the small van you're trying to heat up, or anything else flammable. You'd think they could at least put some sort of flared guard or bumpers around the front to help keep stuff from coming in contact with that metal grill, sort of like the \"bumpers\" on chicken house heaters to keep their metal grill from contacting stuff if the heater is knocked over, but apparently that'd require too much thought.\n\nThere's only one safe way to place this heater -- on its side with the legs extended, as shown in the product photo. You can't stand it up like a candle, it might fall over and then that metal ring around the front (which gets very hot) would contact something that you probably don't want contacted.\n\nThis doesn't put out much heat on high heat but still drains a 1 pound can of propane within four hours. No problem, you say, you'll just hook it up to the 20 pound tank for your barbecue and have plenty of heat for all night camping for a week? Uhm, no. a) there is no way to hook a 20 pound tank to this heater, and b) if you did rig up a hose of some sort, see the part about only one safe way to place this heater -- by removing the rear \"leg\" (the 1 pound canister), the heater is now in an attitude that is unsafe. Coleman says \"don't do it\" and they're right -- this heater simply is designed wrong to be safe when used with an external propane tank.\n\nThere's no safety cut-off to turn off the heater if it gets bumped and falls over from the pictured attitude, which as I noted is the only safe attitude. So don't leave the heater alone with a dog  or large cat that might bump into it and make it fall over, or you might come back to a smoldering tent and barbecued Fido/Fluffy.\n\nAll in all, this heater works, but it's profoundly mediocre. I've used it in my garage to supplement an electric heater that struggles with cooler temperatures, but due to its limitations never used it for camping as originally intended, and probably won't ever do so. In particular, the very hot grill on the front is such a safety hazard that I refuse to use it anywhere but on the concrete floor of my garage, where if it falls over all that'll happen is that it contacts non-flammable concrete.\n\nI'm now researching better options for a tent heater, because this just isn't acceptable to me. You'd have to haul along a metal roasting pan and a piece of fiberglass insulation to make this safe to use in a tent (the pan to hold the heater, the fiberglass insulator to go under the pan to insulate it from the tent floor), and at that point you're into a realm of clunkiness that makes me say, \"eh, time to do something else.\"", "summary": "Profoundly mediocre", "unixReviewTime": 1325462400}

For years, Coleman pressure lanterns (and a few hurricane lanterns) lit our nights on the other side of the world.\n\nThese days, as outdoor lovers -- and prepping for emergency power outages, short or long-term -- we decided to add a couple of these lanterns to our equipment. We love the fact that there's been a breakthrough in fuel supply. These also readily burn regular \"car\" gasoline and that makes them extra useful, and certainly worth a few more bucks. What you save on gasoline by the gallon alone is worth the money (yesterday, the price of a gallon of white gas at my hardware store was $13).\n\nIn general, with all our equipment, we burn gasoline that is treated with&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Sea-Foam-SF-16-Motor-Treatment-16-oz/dp/B0002JN2EU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sea Foam SF-16 Motor Treatment - 16 oz.</a>. This is so much better than the competitors' gasoline treatment-for-storage products, and keeps all your gasoline engines starting and running better. It came to us recommended by a highly experienced small engine mechanic, and our engine headaches largely disappeared after that. We use it regularly in all our equipment, truck and car. Treated gas burns great in this lantern, and I can even leave fuel in the tank, ready to go in an emergency.\n\nWe bought this with another great \"blast from the past\" -- the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Coleman-Guide-Series-Powerhouse-TM-Dual-Fuel-TM-Stove/dp/B00006I56J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Coleman Guide Series Powerhouse(TM) Dual Fuel(TM) Stove</a>. It's another classic, now improved by being able to burn gasoline as well.\n\nThis lanterns comes in a strong hard shell, which makes taking it camping extra-easy.

How stereotypically hick of me :)\n\nHow I used it in context to this review:\n- I used it in my Primos Ground Max Eclipse Hunting Blind (http://www.amazon.com/Primos-GB2500-The-Eclipse-Blind/dp/B001P5G6TI), which has the dimensions (L x W x H): 77.0 x 77.0 x 70.0 while hunting deer.\n\nPros:\n- Heats well for the reasons I bought it.  I keep it right at my feet and it heats up my feet and legs warm which in turn keeps me warm all over.  Does not keep the hunting blind warmed up as I have the hunting windows open preventing any real heat build up in the blind.\n\n- It is very simple to operate.  You turn the knob to high for about 30-45 seconds so propane will feed out and then you press the electric striker to fire up the heater.  I have seen other portable propane heaters that need a match or that force you to prime the device for 1 minute, then you strike and hold the knob in a pilot light ignition position for another minute, then you reset the knob and turn on to the desired heat level.  That is too much trouble.\n\n- The heater is very quiet.  An animal within 5 yards will likely not hear the sound. The closest encounter I have had is a deer 20 yards away and it did not hear or smell the heater.  Even the strike of the ignition switch is not much louder then when I bump my rifle against my chair leg or my shooting stick.\n\n- Works well on high and low settings.  I used it on both settings in 12F temperature, where everything was covered in frost, and with 15 mph wind blowing from the north.  Had no issues keeping my feet and in turn my body warm.  When my fingers got a little cold I just put my hands down between my legs to catch the rising heat and they warmed up nicely.\n\nCons:\n- Has a very slight propane burning odor on high setting.  It was only noticeable when I bent down to warm my hands and the heater was on high.  I did not really notice it when the heater was on low or when I was sitting completely erect in my chair.  If you are hunting you should be upwind of your prey anyway making this slight odor a non-issue.\n\n- Takes 30-45 seconds to start up.  I would stop the heater after I would warm up and then start it up again later when I was getting chilled.  I would become impatient waiting the 30-45 seconds and click the starter a few times making noise and taking my attention away from hunting, etc.  This is basically a \"me\" problem and could be solved by just being more patient.\n\nConcluding Statement:\n\nI have not used the heater in a great deal of situations so I cannot give you any information on the life, durability, and exact efficiency of the heater.  All I know is that it works well for my hunting needs and I would buy another if I needed it.  I also think that it would keep my feet and legs warm even in an open tripod hunting stand or a tree stand.\n\nFor non hunters this would work fine for direct heat in a camping or emergency situation.  It would not effectively heat an uninsulated space larger than the dimensions of my blind.\n\nI hope this information is helpful :)", "summary": "Hunting Related Review of Coleman BlackCat EI Catalytic Heater", "unixReviewTime": 1294099200}

Using unleaded gasoline, two are reasonably bright-ish in an orangey sort of way (but still don't put out as much light as I remember the green Coleman Fuel Only lanterns producing, and the light is NOT bright white), but the third is only about two-thirds as bright as the others no matter how I tweak it or what variables I change.\n\nI've tried all the big-name unleaded gasoline brands as well as the cheapies - 10% ethanol blend (which is about all they sell in and around Mount Goatmore Texas) and pure gasoline when I can find it - and it doesn't seem to make much difference.\n\nThe dual fuel lanterns work just fine with Coleman fuel, (but then what's the point of paying the premium for the alleged dual fuel capability?) and work almost as well with a 50-50 mix of Coleman Fuel and 10% ethanol unleaded gasoline, which is the route I'm going. Their light output with the 50-50 mix is still not quite bright white, but it IS brighter and less orangey than using unleaded gasoline alone.\n\nI'll likely have to dig down to the bottom of my camping box and see if I still have any of the lantern mantles from the 80s that were made with thorium and were BRIGHT - BRIGHT - BRIGHT and see if that helps any.\n\nThings to consider:\n\n1. If you're going to store it fueled up for emergency use, store it 3/4 filled with Coleman fuel and NOT unleaded gasoline.\n\n2. Buy the hard plastic storage case if it is not included as part of a package - worth every penny.  Make sure the bottom tabs are properly secured when you close the case.  I've never had a problem with the case bottom coming unfastened and dropping the lantern (I have these three lanterns, two green Coleman Fuel lanterns, and one 1975 red single mantle lantern - all in Coleman plastic cases), but other reviewers have experienced this.\n\n3. A long-nose disposable butane utility lighter will make lighting a snap, and will store inside the hard plastic storage case.\n\n4.

We are pretty serious about camping and I know a thing or two about Coleman liquid fueled lanterns, so I wanted to share my experience with the \"Dual Fuel\" model. It's a liquid-fueled, two sock mantle lantern. It burns either gasoline (regular unleaded) or Coleman's camp fuel (a classified mixture, probably mostly naphtha and some additives for storage life). You have adjustable light outputs and runs on air pressure. It's incredibly simple and there are few moving parts, so it's incredibly reliable. You can also repair it if something breaks or wears out.\n\nIt's made almost entirely of steel (with the exception of brass generator and pump parts, and the brass fuel cap, plastic fuel control knob) that's been coated in enamel (the chimney and top cap) for long life and heat resistance. The fuel tank is painted, heavy gauge steel, and the rest of the lantern (globe holder/base, heat shield, valve shroud) is stamped galvanized sheet steel. It will last a long time if you take care of it.\n\nIt's simple how it works. The pressurized fuel is squirted up the brass generator to a burner at the top. The fuel is sprayed out of the generator and disperses in the burner. The operation depends on high temperatures to work right so it has to warm up (hence the mantles being close to the generator). The heat vaporizes the fuel into a gas and it passes down the burner stalks and is ignited, which burns very hot and makes the mantles glow.\n\nIf lighting for the first time, you need to burn-in the mantles. Make sure they're tied tightly to the burner stalks. Doesn't matter how they are positioned. Fill the fuel tank (don't overfill it or you'll get leaks and it could catch fire when you light it), cap it. Unscrew the pump 2 turns and pump it up 30-50 times. Make sure your thumb covers the vent hole on the pump knob. Don't over pump it. When it gets stiff, stop. If you're burning in the mantles, light them on fire. I use a barbecue lighter to reach through the hole on the globe support and light each mantle. Let them burn until they are mostly white ash and while they are burning, open the fuel valve until you get fire. Don't turn it up high, keep it on low until the mantles are completely burned and are white. You'll get fire coming out of the burners and that's normal until the generator gets hot and vaporizes the fuel. It takes about a minute for it to reach operating temperature and the mantles start glowing on their own and the fire stops. You might have to pump it some more while it's lighting for more pressure.\n\nThat's it! It can be kind of intimidating at first with the fire coming out, but that's normal and will go away. Don't worry it won't explode. Just don't turn the fuel valve on high while it's doing that or you could get big fire. Once you've done it a couple times, you get used to it.\n\nIt's really bright on full blast! Will light up a campsite no problem. Brighter than an LED lantern, and the fuel tank will last you about 8-10 hours on full power. I have run it two evenings and nights before and only used 3/4 of the fuel so it lasts quite a while. It can burn either regular unleaded gasoline or Coleman's own fuel. I prefer gasoline because it's cheaper (about $3.50 a gallon opposed to almost $9 for the other stuff). I noticed it doesn't run as long or get as bright on gasoline, but the difference is made up for in the cost savings.\n\nIt's very durable. The only real issue I had was from taking them razor clamming and getting ocean water on them, which rusted the exposed metal and made a real mess of the lantern. It still worked fine though after some cleaning. If you properly maintain it, it will last for decades. The only consumable parts are the mantles and possibly the rubber seal in the air pump piston, which can dry rot over time if not kept oiled (use a medium oil, you want something viscous like just regular general purpose oil. I use Hoppes oil). Everything else lasts a long time, the life of the lantern. If something does go bad, you can order a new part from Coleman. I rebuilt another one of these (not dual fuel) with off-shelf parts and some parts I had to order from Coleman it works great. It's also cheap to fix. On the downside, not really a fault of the lantern, is that you can't take it in a tent with you like an LED lamp. It makes carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide on gasoline, plus it gets real hot. It makes a great hand warmer though. It's also fragile due to the glass globe and mantles so you have to be a little careful transporting it.\n\nThe plastic cover is nice, but make sure the locking tabs are pressed into the base to keep it from falling out. Plus it can hold mantles in the space under the fuel tank.\n\nPros:\n\nVery bright\nLasts forever\nUses cheap unleaded gas\nEasy to maintain\nLong run time\n\nCons:\n\nCan be intimidating the first time you use it\nNot cheap\n\nIf I had a choice between an LED lamp and this, I'd probably choose both. LED for in my tent and the gas for outside. It's not cheap and is designed for outdoor use only, but you can't fault it. It is super bright, will last for thousands of hours and is cheap to run. Gets my high recommendation.", "summary": "The Classic. Super Bright and Reliable with Economical Dual Fuel Operation", "unixReviewTime": 1410134400}

I'd love a bigger broom though.  If this is all you have, you'll do a lot of uncomfortable stooping and sweeping even a small tent will take forever- it is very small.  A short broom that you can use on your knees, or bent over while standing, and using this as a dust brush will be better.  I love the dustpan- it has a little indent so that sand and other small particles are less likely to fall out the front of the pan.  The broom and dustpan get 4 stars (5 for the pan, 3 for the broom).\n\nThe mallet is OK.  Nice, heavy rubber mallet.  However, it isn't all that heavy duty, and after several uses, it is clear I will need to replace it at the end of this camping season.  The mallet is 3-3 1/2 stars.\n\nThe stakes, before I used them I thought they were great.  The whole setup is quite inexpensive, and these are some nice (looking) heavy duty stakes.  The flimsy stakes that come with most tents are only acceptable in perfect weather, and having this kit in my trunk with these stakes gave me peace of mind.  Then, last weekend, it was very windy when I put up my tent and I didn't think the stock stakes would hold, so I used these.  They did their job well, they held the tent and stayed sturdy despite some pretty nasty winds...then I tried to break camp on Sunday.  Well, these are 10\" nail style stakes.  They hold well.  You need some real leverage to get them out.  The nail head offers nothing.  The plastic at the top broke.  At that point, any hope of ever getting these out of the ground were gone.  I had to work my tent loops up and over the stakes and leave the stakes in the ground as there was no way I was ever getting them out.  I'd suggest holding on to these for nothing but emergency use, and buy a set of sturdy aluminum stakes with a metal \"loop\" at the top like the Kelty \"No Bendium\" stakes or with the nylon pull strings like the Coleman Heavy Duty stakes or MSR Ground Hogs.  The stakes are only 2 stars (2 and not 1 since they do work well as heavy duty stakes in a pinch, but, especially in hard ground or heavy roots, you'll never be able to recover them).\n\nThe stake puller is OK.  It seems like it is a bit flimsy.  When using the cheaper pegs that come with my tents it does a fine job pulling them up.  When using longer pegs (like the aforementioned stakes that come with this set), it did do some bending.  It is still useable, but I think I will be looking for something heavier duty. 3 stars.\n\nSo, overall, it is an OK set.  It probably serves best to keep it in your trunk at all times in case you need it and forgot something when packing for camping.  Price is good, so if you are camping and forgot something, and need something now, and this is all the stores have, you'll be fine with it to fill in for your regular gear.  All the items seem a little flimsy for long-term use.  Good in a pinch, not so good for  your go-to gear.", "summary": "Buy items separately, spend a little more, and do better, but OK for quick, budget buy", "unixReviewTime": 1311379200}

However, after our first weekend of using it we had some rain. The box would have been ruined. The downside to the plastic case is that you cant put the lantern in it while it's still hot. After it was time for bed I had to wait for it to cool down (in the rain) before I put it in its case. A vented metal case would be much better. As far as the complaints about the case not latching properly, I can see why it could be an issue. You have to carefully snap the hooks completely in place or the bottom may fall out. This wasn't an issue for me. I can see the snaps wearing out after some use though and maybe some of the case come with bad latches.\n\nIf you are looking for a good lantern this may be it.\n\n9/28/2013 update:\nThis lantern is still working great after three years of use.

Blocked the sun well, too. The well-designed back door is important for air flow. It seems well-constructed, overall.\n\nYou may never get it back into its original bag ever again, by the way. This is a common problem with tents, but this one is really bad - especially considering you'll be trying to fold it up on a (sometimes windy) beach.

I found it somewhat tricky to get small enough to get back into the carrying bag, even following the directions. I was able to ultimately get it zipped into the bag, but it took a bit of wrestling.

It takes a few minutes to set up, I'm sure It'll faster as time goes by.  The quality is definitely Coleman.\nWe took this to the beach on a very sunny, but windy day.  The set up was a challenge as the wind kept us on our toes.  The anchors were useless with so much wind, but we had coolers and bags that we used to weigh everything down.  We spent most of the day, half in and half out playing card games, reading books and enjoying the beach.  It was perfect for 2 adults and a 9 year old.  But I did spend some time people watching.  What I saw made me love our shady tent more! I watched as people clung to their umbrellas as they tipped and flopped.  I watched as peoples towels were blown over and hat flying off in a swoop.  And I watched as people tried to eat without getting a gust of sand to add to their snacks.  Without the sides to protect us from the wind, we would've taken part in that mess.  Instead, we just got to kick back and enjoy the day.\nThe size is way smaller and lighter than an umbrella with a good anchor would be AND it actually fits back in the bag (feel like that never happens).

So far, it has held up to our use pretty well.  It can be a little tricky to put up and will probably be aggravating for you the first time you set it up.  I suggest practicing before you go to the beach.  After becoming familiar with it, I can put it up by myself in about 10 minutes.  It helps to have an extra hand at the beach especially because it is more windy there.  When we purchased ours and set it up the first time, we noticed two small holes in the side of it.  I used some seam tape on the holes to help it from tearing or opening up more and that did the trick for us.  It's pretty roomy and a bit bigger than most of the instant shelters that I have seen.  The front can be zipped up and there is a back window that can also be covered.  I wanted this one mostly because of those features as it would allow for us to change clothes inside and not have to use the dirty public rest rooms that are at the beach.  It can get hot inside especially when the back window is closed but with the front and back open, it provides good wind flow through the tent.  There are netted pockets in the corners of the tent and it comes with small sandbags to assist in holding it down.  Directions for putting the tent up can be found sewn to the inside of the tent bag and they are pretty easy to follow.  The tent also has guy lines and stakes included.\n\nOverall, we are pretty pleased with it but it does take a little longer to put up than some of the \"instant\" shade shelters.

I had a \"camping\" themed Christmas this year because I wanted to stock up on supplies to take my own family to the great outdoors.  One of the items I asked for was this set of enamel plates from Coleman.  Upon inspecting them, I noticed a lot of enamel paint chips in the bottom of the box.  Two of the cups have large sections in which the enamel coating is missing.  This doesn't look like a packaging or shipping defect...it looks like poor quality on how they were coated.  Some of the bowels and plates have runs in the coating as well...but at least it is covered.  What surprises me is that all the contents in this box was hand packed.  It is made in China and it looks like they would at least throw the bad cups out when they were packing them in the box.  The section in which there is no enamel is pretty darn noticeable.  Everything else seems fine.  My box might be a fluke but it was pretty disappointing to see that the quality was not what I expected.  The runs in the paint coating and the uneven layers make me think that this are not going to last very long.  The silverware seems to be ok and I like that it comes in a protective pouch to keep it organized.

It's difficult to hang high enough and the nozzle wastes water as you slide it in/out to turn the flow on/off (a push-button would have been better).  Some brands of these bags have built-in chemical thermometers which change colors to indicate temperature, but the way I use this bag it isn't necessary.\n\nAs an easy and cheap way to heat up water, this is great.  Fill and leave in a sunny spot.  The water can actually get too hot, so check it before letting the kids bathe.  Add cold water until acceptable -- cooler than you'd want at home, in order to allow more people to shower per bag.  It saves a lot of time (and fuel) over heating that much (cold) water on a stove.\n\nWe dispense a third to a half of the heated water into a collapsable bucket and add cold/hot water (e.g. from stove) to bring it to a comfortable temperature.  Use a cup to scoop the water for bathing.  This method not only conserves water, allows accurate temperature control, but allows you to ration the water.  It would be difficult to pour boiling water in the bag directly if it wasn't warm enough (e.g. you don't get back to camp until sunset and the water has already cooled somewhat).  I've found that using the nozzle, one person may consume 3/4 the bag (one big friend used the entire 5 gal).  By splitting and using a cup, 2-3 adults can thoroughly bathe with 5gal.  When rationing smaller amounts, we tell folks to bring their water bottle (cold water) with them in case they run out.\n\nOur family of five is served with a single 5gal bag by adding cold/hot water.  We keep the kettle on while folks are bathing and can all shower one after the other with no waiting for the water to heat on the stove.  We use a full-size house kettle, not a dinky camping kettle.\n\nI also own a Zodi shower (propane water heater) but don't even use it anymore as this simple low-tech method is sufficient, faster, and packs better.\n\nFor the shower tent, the pop-up style one didn't last; we now use one with proper steel poles and it's much better, albeit large to pack.  But whenever there's a strong wind, the pop-up wouldn't hold up.  Also the popup seemed colder because the wind seemed to pass through the flimsy nylon too easily.  I don't remember what brand we used to have for the popup, but here's the shower stall we use now (recommended):&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Texsport-Instant-Portable-Outdoor-Camping-Shower-Privacy-Shelter-Changing-Room/dp/B000ITVSSQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Texsport Instant Portable Outdoor Camping Shower Privacy Shelter Changing Room</a>", "summary": "Works perfectly well the way I use it (read description)", "unixReviewTime": 1501718400}

It does self inflate.  The problem  is what you do after they self inflate.  You can leave the valve open, but then you have no padding.  Or you close out the valve, and you trap the air in.  The problem is that the air rushes around to where there is no pressure on the pad, and you again have no padding, but this time you have ballooning where the air rushed to.  Basically your padding becomes a foot support.\n\nThese were returned the next day.  I do no recommend this product.  If I were to make a recommendation to the manufacturer, I would tell them to find a way to isolate the air so that it actually creates padding where it is needed.  One way would be to create chambers so that air movement would be restricted.

I did what everyone else probably did...looked at the Yeti's and dreamed...and drooled. Then got a brisk slap across the face from my wife when she thought I might actually pay $600 ON A COOLER. Those Yeti's may be amazing but those prices are just absurd and cannot be justified by anyone who isn't literally a mountain man or a hunter who needs ice not to freeze for 10 days. Most of us normal guys who go weekend camping, don't fall into either of those categories, and so we turn our Yeti search into a \"what cooler is also awesome but doesn't cost me my first born child\" search.\n\nI've only ever owned Coleman and Igloo coolers and so that search began with those two. When I was underwhelmed with what Igloo had out there, I made the switch to Coleman and was immediately impressed by this cooler.\n\nMy search criteria where as follows;\nMetal hinges (had an old Igloo with plastic hinges finally blow out on me, granted it was a 30yr old cooler so props to Igloo)\nMetal handles\nSolid handle and/or locking mechanism\nHard lined and o-ring sealed\n\nThe Coleman Steel-Belted Cooler fit all of these criteria and was available for the modest price of $80. I deemed the 54 quart to be of substantial size based on the \"can capacity\" that is listed in the description. I love that Coleman knows their customers and knows we will want to know how many beer...I mean soda cans, that the cooler can fit.\n\nTrust me folks, I've beaten this thing up to heck and back on my camp trips and it has performed admirably. It can take a hit and keep on going, washed of easily with a hose, the hard lining wipes out quickly with a paper towel and it kept my ice frozen for 2 days straight.

The blue panels are diamond-rip stop polyester taffeta, and the charcoal parts do not appear to be rip-stop.  It's filled with 2 lbs 14 oz of \"Coletherm\" hollow core poly fill insulation. The net pack weight (the bag in the stuff sack) is just over 4 lbs.  I bought two, and one weighed 4 lb 0.5 oz and the other 4 lb 1.8 oz on a postal scale.  The stuff sack weights 2.5 oz, so the sleeping bag alone weighs just under 4 lbs, which is a good rule-of-thumb maximum limit for a sleeping bag to take backpacking.\n\nIt easily can keep you comfortable down to the 15 degree F rating. This bag is very compressible for it's loft.  The size in the included stuff sack is 10\" diameter and 14\" long, which most people will find to be an odd size for backpacking. However, it will fit (stuffed) into 1100-1200 cubic inch backpack compartments.  It easily fits in an 9\" x 24\" compression sack (not included) and squeezes down to approx. 9\" x 17\" pack size if you want to attach it outside your pack.\n\nFor the price/weight, this bag is a great buy for both general camping and light-to-medium backpacking for 3-season use by Boy Scouts.  Although it is true you can get goose-down bags for the same temperature range that are about 1 lb lighter and more compressible for hard-core backpacking, I'm generally opposed to down bags for Boy Scouts for several reasons:  a. down is outrageously expensive, especially given the likelihood of some rough treatment and short lifespan, b. a down bag is useless if it gets wet, and c. they require special cleaning or special soap for home washing.\n\nMy only complaints are that the shell isn't 100% rip-stop material, and the included stuff sack is an odd size, but at a price around 40 bucks, both can be forgiven.", "summary": "Good all-purpose scout bag for price", "unixReviewTime": 1257897600}

No, really I am basically a beginner on a tight budget so I'm on the prowl for deals. I scoured Amazon and I settled for this Coleman Crescent bag, because well, Coleman is a name I've trusted for years, I'd never heard of the  other brands, and I really didn't know exactly what I was looking for. Not long after I ordered the bag I realized it was supposedly for \"tall\" people, which I certainly am not. Then after talking to my Uncle who has been backpacking for 20+ years, I started to worry about the 5.2 pound listed weight of the bag. All my fears were for naught though because when the bag arrived I immediately saw that it wasn't the same bag. Yes, it was a Coleman Crescent, but it was blue with a completely different design on the front, it was normal sized, and it weighed less then 2.5 pounds. It easily fit into the stuff sack and fit perfectly into my 35.00$ Cuscus Backpack. I will warn you however that this bag looks like it will only fit into bigger packs, as in 85 litres and higher...Needless to say I spent the entire month of August humping this bag into the mountains up here in the great white north of Washington State.. It probably only dipped into the low 40's or high 30's at the lowest, but I was so hot some nights I had to strip off thermals in the middle of the night. As a matter of fact, every single time ive used this bag I had to partially unzip it because I woke up in the night too hot.\n\nSo to recap... (1)The bag isn't too expensive. (2)The bag they send you is better then the bag described. (3) It is fairly lightweight, and should fit into or under your large pack, or easily strap onto an external frame (I've done both with it). (4)It keeps you warm at night.\n\nWinter is around the corner so I should test the 15 degree rating as I backpack deep into fall, but I'm guessing it will do alright. The only knock I have is that there isn't any room to move your legs. I know it's a mummy bag and all, but dang, the legs are a little too snug.

We bought two and have used them as beach shades, as shelter during sporting events, and even as a tent during weekend camping trips.\n\nMany of the concerns expressed by reviews posted here could be addressed by reading the directions which are cleverly stitched right into the inside seam of the convenient 2' x half foot-sized carrying bag.\n\nThis is not billed as a pop-up tent. You will need an unobstructed 20' X 15'-wide space. Assembly first requires linking the one collapsible 14' main pole (grey) and two collapsible 9' crossover poles (black) before sliding these poles into their reinforced sleeves.\n\nThis is also not billed as a 1-person job. Once the tent poles are inserted, one person must support the tent while the other person fits the end poles into the web strap grommets. The tent then snaps into place and you will be astounded at how big it is. My 4' 6\" son can stand up inside of it - you won't feel claustrophobic inside this shelter.\n\nOther features include the rear vent and mesh flaps and a vestibule-style front entrance and four interior mesh pockets. I prefer&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/plastic-stakes/dp/B004D8MZ6C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">plastic stakes</a>&nbsp;to the enclosed metal ones. Our family of five gets a lot of use out of these multi-use, attractive, sturdy and generously sized shade shelters. Highly recommended.", "summary": "Gimmie Shelter", "unixReviewTime": 1433203200}

The place to stash gear is kind of small, but if you keep everything in a drybag, you don't have to worry about it getting wet and the cargo net should keep it secure.\n\nPeople have mentioned that the paddle can break easily.  In my opinion, that's probably a result of not pushing the metal ends all the way into the black plastic handle parts.  If you push them in all the way and tighten them down, there will be plenty of \"purchase\".  I can't imagine the paddle breaking under normal use if it's put together all the way.  A longer paddle would be nice though because it will drip on you.  By the way, if you don't inflate the backrest all the way, you can make it a little more comfortable for just lounging.\n\nThe only improvements I'd like to see are another cargo area behind the seat, larger tracking fins, more attachment areas so you can tie off to other inflatable boats and a longer paddle, but as-is, it's still a great little inflatable boat and lots of fun to use.\n\nI've owned this boat for probably 6 or seven years now.

It's sooooo darned sexy !!\n\nOK, so we have had ours about seven years or so. We bought it when we were still tent camping, and now we use it with our pop-up camper. We could not be much happier with any cooler. You need to make one improvement as soon as you buy this, but it's so inexpensive, I still have to give this 5 stars. I'd give it 6 if I could. Go to your nearest big box home improvement store and buy a small roll of white adhesive backed 1/4\" X 1/4\" foam gasket by Frost King or similar manufacturer. Clean the groove in the lid with a solvent like Mineral spirits or similar. Peel the backing off the gasket and stick the gasket into the groove in the lid, working your way around to  the back where you started. Cut the gasket so its essentially one continuous seal, leaving as small of a gap between start and finish as possible. Now when you close the lid you will have a virtually air tight seal.\n\nWe go camping a week, or sometimes eight days at a time. Before we leave I go to the grocery store and buy 2 five lb. pieces of block ice to put in the bottom. If you have the freezer space, you could make some block ice at home and save the 4 or 5 bucks. After placing the block ice one either side of the bottom of the cooler, I add our weeks worth of food.... bacon, dogs, burgers, bacon, milk, butter, bacon, steak, bacon, you name it ! Then on top of the food I add regular ice, which I make at home, though sometimes we buy it bagged at the store. This cooler keeps ice 8 days or more this way....... no kidding ! I'm so completely impressed. I have left the cooler closed after returning home and had some of the block ice still in it over 9 days.\n\nYes, I also grew up camping with a 1960s original steel belted Coleman cooler and, yes, I'll admit the quality of the vintage coolers was better. Thicker steel, better latch, screw on O-ringed drain cap, and built in bottle opener. Believe me, I will get that ole Coleman from my big brother one day !!

It is roomy for two adults. The large rear window has an insect screen and can be opened for air circulation. When fully closed, there is enough room for one adult to get changed.\n\nThe windy day exposed a couple of flaws. First, if it's windy you'll need better pegs. The six pegs provided would be adequate for firm soil, but not sand. Second, I'm not sure why but the two guy ropes would not stay tightened (even when there was no wind). The nylon friction devices slipped far too easily on the cord. I've never had this problem before on any other tent and may need to buy replacements.\n\nThis shade tent was difficult to put up single-handed. I am an experienced camper, and over the years have owned a number of tents with the shock-corded pole design. All of the others (including my current three-person made by Coleman) I could/can erect unassisted in a few minutes. I think the biggest issue with this tent is that the sleeves for the poles are mesh, rather than solid material. This makes sliding the poles in and out a real hassle; the pole joints continuously snag on the mesh, so you need an extra pair of hands to help guide them through.\n\nOverall I'm happy with my purchase because once the tent is up it does its job very well, and I have no doubts about its quality and longevity.", "summary": "Nice design, but not totally user-friendly", "unixReviewTime": 1409702400}

I caught a really good sale elsewhere Memorial day weekend.  But on to the review.\n\nI was a backpacker in high school and college and a little beyond.  But I've been away from it for a couple of decades.  Bear canisters didn't exist way back when so, I'd never used one.  And I never had a problem with bears in the the White Mountains of NH where I used to hike.  But I did have plenty of problems with mice around shelters and chipmunks and squirrels and raccoons.  Annoying little buggers.  We also have coyotes, fox, bobcats / lynx, the very rare reported cougar sighting, and brainless golden retrievers on the trail.  By far, I worry more about rodents than bears.\n\nSo when I got into backpacking again, I did a lot of reading to catch up on equipment and clothing trends.  One thing I found is that many areas and national parks around the country are now requiring some form of bear resistant protection for your food.  Hmmm, never even crossed my mind.  Apparently black bear populations are doing really well here in the Northeast and human / bear interactions have increased to the point where it's not all that unusual to get a visit from a lazy thief looking for snacks.\n\nSo I looked around at bear canisters and quickly narrowed my choices down to two options, the Bear Keg and the Bear Vault BV500.  I finally chose the Bear Keg.  Why?\n\n1.)  Size: Both are large.  The Bear Vault is 700 cu in or 11.47 liters.  The Bear keg is just slightly larger at 716 cu in or 11.73 liters.  But call the size a tie.  Both can handle food for two people for 4-5 days.\n\n2.)  Access: Both have an opening of almost exactly 7\" which is fine for getting stuff in or out.  Again, no significant difference.\n\n3.)  Weight: Here we get into the biggest difference between the two options.  The Bear Vault is made from polycarbonate and weighs 2.5 lbs.\n\nThe Bear Keg is made from some other polymer but they don't state exactly what and it weighs in at a whopping 3.5 lbs empty.  So the Bear Vault wins on weight which is a biggie.\n\n4.) Locks:  Here's the second big difference.  The Bear Vault uses a screw on lid with plastic tabs that need to be depressed in order to rotate the lid.  But people report that depressing those tabs requires a leaning curve.  And they say that when the plastic is cold it doesn't flex very well.  Also cold fingers are apparently hard pressed to operate the tabs.  But most importantly bears in the Adirondacks of NY, about two hours from my home have apparently figured out how to use the tabs just fine.  The Bear Vault has proven to be defeatable by real black bears.\n\nThe Bear Keg on the other hand uses three rotating latches that require some sort of tool to open.  A coin, a key, a knife, something with a thin straight edge.  The locks are simple, easy to use in any weather, and reliable.  But best of all, bears haven't figured out how to defeat them as long as you close up the keg properly.\n\n5.)  Color:  No, I'm not gonna get into a discussion of trail fashion here.  The Bear Vault uses clear polycarbonate which provides a really nice side benefit.....you can see what's in the canister and where it is in the canister.  This cuts down on digging, dumping, and repacking.  But a clear canister can be a lot more difficult to find in the woods.  What if a bear plays with it for 15 minutes and moves it 100 feet from its original location.  Clear or black canisters are a lot tougher to see when you don't know where to look.\n\nThe Bear Keg on the other hand uses an opaque day glow yellow polymer that stands out like a sore thumb against a green, brown, and grey background in the woods.  It also had a band of reflective material around the middle in case you're searching for it with a headlamp at night.  The convenience of a clear container does me no good if I can't find the container.  Also, these bear canisters are not so huge that it's very difficult to find stuff in them.  And it gets easier every day as you consume the food in them.\n\n6.)  Price:  Both the Bear Vault and the Bear Keg have the same list price and both can be found discounted to near the same price online.  So price is not a discriminating factor.\n\n7.)  Attaching To A Pack:  The Bear Vault has dimples and ridges molded in for grip.  These allow it to be cinched to a pack with paracord or a velcro strap.\n\nThe Bear Keg is smooth and slippery all the way around with an oval shape that's fatter at the center than the ends.  That makes it tougher for a bear to manipulate but it also means it's tougher to attach to a pack.  For that reason, They sell a nylon carrying case for the Bear Keg but that increases the cost and drives up the weight even more.  Not a problem for me, my pack is a 110 liter Kelty Red Cloud.  I carry everything inside my pack.  It's easier than lashing stuff to the outside.  If you intend to lash a canister outside your pack the carry case is a must have.  But DO NOT place the canister at night with the case on.  The nylon bag provides a bear with a convenient carry handle to cart off your bear keg, thereby defeating the whole idea of protecting your food supply.\n\nSo in the end, what made me buy the Bear Keg over a lighter alternative were better security, easy to use locks, and the high visibility color.  I couldn't find any place in the lower 48 where the Bear Keg is not certified for use.  On the other hand, the Adirondacks near my home won't allow the Bear Vault because bears have learned how to defeat the locks on it.\n\nI docked the product one star for weight.  This is one of the heaviest options on the market.  I'd love to see them get the weight down a pound or so without compromising volume or security.  But maybe that's a tough wish to fulfill.\n\nPS - Either of these canisters makes a serviceable camp stool for eating, lacing up your boots, washing dishes, or washing clothes.\n\nHappy trails and be safe out there.", "summary": "Good security, easy to use locks, and high visibility overcame the high 3.5 lb weight for me.", "unixReviewTime": 1496275200}

This was before my wife was even pregnant.  Fast forward to a few months ago, we were concerned about sun exposure with our daughter (who would be 4 months old by the time we would use this tent).  Our pediatrician gave us 2 guidelines.\n1. Limit all sun exposure, if possible.\n2. If #1 is not possible, then use baby sunscreen (but try to not use it until she's 6 months old).\n\nBy those 2 guidelines, I started searching all over for some kind of protection on the beach.  I originally saw the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Sport-Brella-Umbrella-Portable-Sun-and-Weather-Shelter/dp/B002CLQ1T4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sport-Brella Umbrella - Portable Sun and Weather Shelter</a>&nbsp;at a local store.  They had it set up on display but there were a few things I didn't like about it.\n\nFirst, it seemed too low on the ground.  I know that 90% of the time I will be sitting down in it but it just seemed too low when using beach chairs with a fairly tall adult.\n\nSecondly, there is no \"bottom\" on it.  It's open to the ground.  So whatever you place the Sport-Brella on, you need to lay down some towels, tarp, or something else unless you want your butt on the ground.  In my case, it would be the sand.\n\nLastly, I didn't like that the Sport-Brella didn't have the ability to close.  It's wide-open design meant that the usage for shade was limited to the sun movement and there was no privacy.  Meaning when my baby is trying to sleep or if I'm changing her/changing my clothes, then it's wide open for everyone to see.\n\nSo that's when I started looking for alternatives and saw the Coleman Beach Shade.  After reading a couple reviews and seeing pictures of other buyers (who also had babies) with it, I was sold.\n\nThe tent is plenty big enough.  Fully assembled with the front flap down & anchored (as seen in the picture) it can easily accommodate two adults and a baby with plenty of space for a diaper bag, cooler, etc.  With front flap up, an adult and a baby can easily lay down on their backs with it.\n\nWith the design, you get plenty of sun protection via the shade & SPF fabric.  The ability to open the rear for venting air or even as an exit is a nice touch.  It doesn't get too hot in there and while on the beach, there was a nice breeze flowing through the tent.\n\nAlso, I *LOVED* that it came with both stakes AND sandbags for options to anchor the tent down.\n\nMy only complaint about the tent is that when assembling, it can take a little while to put together.  When trying the first time, it can easily take you 20 minutes to put it together.  It definitely becomes easier if you have a second person.  I've assembled/disassembled this tent at least a dozen times now and although I get better at it with each try, it still takes time to put together.  I've shaved my time down to about 8-10 minutes.  With the tent, you get 3 poles.  The 2 shorter black poles run from front to back.  The long gray pole runs across the two black poles.  Once the poles are installed, you fit each end into a grommet at the base of the tent.  The problem is that the long gray pole gets caught on the mesh fabric regardless of whether you're assembling or disassembling the tent.  Part of the reason it gets caught is because the poles can collapse.  This is part of the reason how/why the tent can fit in the carry bag.  When shoving the rod through the mesh (or pulling), sometimes the pole collapses and you have to fix it.  This is why it's so hard to put the tent together.  And because of that, I dock it one star.\n\nOverall I love this tent and would gladly recommend it to anyone looking for shade on the beach... especially those with babies!", "summary": "Purchased for My Infant - Excellent Tent But A Little Hard to Set Up", "unixReviewTime": 1404086400}

The handles are also metal but with plastic grips. The cooler's appearance is stylish. Also, there is NO bottle opener on this version of the cooler. Some reviews allude to the presence of a bottle opener on the outside of the cooler. There is certainly not one on the version I ordered.\n\nFUNCTIONALITY AND USE\n\nHands down this is the best cooler I have ever owned. I take a lot of road trips and travel a lot for work and used to carry along an old generic plastic cooler with me to keep snacks, water, and soda. This cooler has replaced my old beat up travel buddy. It fits nicely in the back of my Ford Escape and has more then enough storage space for meats, cheese, bread, yogurt, fruit, beer, and ice. I can stock it with enough food for a 3-5 day trip easily. The cooler keeps ice for about two to three days outside of extreme temperatures. Two or three two liter bottles of ice are enough to keep everything cold for at least 2 says. If necessary, the ice can be supplemented with a bag of two from the motel to get you through the last day or two of your trip. I do not use the chemical ice packs (except one small one, see below), but they might last a little longer.\n\nNow just one thing to consider before you purchase this item. The cooler can get heavy especially when fully loaded. Of course it depends on what you put in the cooler, but I have loaded mine up to what was probably more then fifty pounds. That can be a lot of weight to carry especially longer distances. Unless you are a large burly man don't plan on carry this cooler, fully loaded, around all day long. (The plastic grips do a good job of stopping the handles from cutting into your hands when carrying and it is on the heavy side). To get around this limitation, I keep a small cold pack in the cooler and a small insulated bag I got as a freebie at a convention. Whenever I need to take something from the car to a different location and do not want to lug the entire cooler I just place what I need in the insulated bag with the cold pack.\n\nTIPS\n\n1. Don't waste your money buying bagged ice at convenience stores. Fill recycled two liter bottles 3/4 way full of water and freeze them. Use these bottles as ice packs. It will not only save you the mess of melted ice, but also a few dollars because you won't have to buy ice.\n\n2. Make sure to chill everything that will go in the cooler at least overnight. This will help extend the life of the ice in the cooler.\n\n3. It is useful to keep something like a bottle opener or cork screw in your cooler. Even a small folding knife can be a lifesaver when you need to cut open a package or some food.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis cooler is well worth the money. Yes, you can find cheaper alternatives in stores and online. But, the value of this cooler cannot be surpassed. You may save a few dollars by buying a generic plastic cooler, but those savings will quickly be lost with all your ice purchases and loss of food due to heat.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "09 16, 2013", "summary": "Great Cooler, Excellent for Roadtrips", "unixReviewTime": 1379289600}

It arrived on time (as usual), and we did a dry run in the back yard.  I figured that was better than breaking up in front of her family at the beach if it were really hard to put together.  One pass over the instructions -  which are cleverly attached to the case so they can't be lost - and I was on my way.  It probably too me ten minutes the first time, but it wasn't that difficult at all.  The most difficult part was putting it back in the case.  But we all know that these things never go back in there the way they were.\n\nBeach day came a couple of days later and it was time for the true test.  I was worried about the stakes not staying in the beach sand, but they performed fine.  It was a little tougher to assemble on the beach than it had been in the back yard due to the wind and sand, but I had experience on my side and it was up in no time.  We convinced the kids that filling the included sand bags was a game, so that pretty much took care of itself.  I did end up spilling one of the sand bags inside of the shade.  I wish the drawstrings had some kind of tension closure.  I think next time I'll bring Ziploc bags to put inside of the sandbags.  Or I could just be more careful.  There were other variants of this nearby on the beach, so I got to watch their experience.  They mostly went up faster, but seemed to not store as compactly.  They also either did not offer as much coverage, or didn't have the complete zip up feature like the Coleman did.  I ended up changing inside of this one which was a neat feature.  The kids enjoyed getting inside and zipping it up also.  Though, out in the sun it got very hot very quickly with the zipper closed.\n\nI can see how the wind could be an issue, .but if you open the back window it seems to pass through.  Overall the shade was awesome and just what I needed.  Almost everyone ended up in it at some point.  One of the kids took a nap in it (when the others weren't using it as a beach fort).  My girlfriend took a nap in it, I spent much of my time avoiding spontaneous combustion in there.  It did fill up with sand pretty easily, but it's the beach... what are ya gonna do?\n\nI have four improvements that it could use:\n1. Two more stakes to hold the front flap down - I'll probably end up buying some because i didn't like that it was just loose.\n2. The lack of side windows made it a little isolating when inside the shade\n3. The guides for the poles are mesh which makes them hard to thread the poles through (though  I can see some benefit of mesh)\n4. Sandbags that seal better\n\nAll of these are minor, and this is an awesome product.", "summary": "Exactly what I needed.", "unixReviewTime": 1403481600}

On this occasion the winds were blowing 8 mph with gusts of 15 mph. I set my lunch pack just inside the screen door to weigh the fabric down as I went through the steps I had practiced during the test run. I experienced zero issues. I used the spikes which were okay. It's important to angle them with the wind. I think I will tie ribbon on them like another user suggestes for next time so they don't get lost, or if I decide to use the sand bags I will bring ziplock bags to keep the sand from sifting out. There are mesh pockets inside the tent for said bags but I think other people have tied them to the outside of the tent and buried them. This setup took under 10 minutes. I think the more patient and methodical your strategy the quicker it goes up. If you happen to have ill tempered kids I would increase the difficulty 5x per infant, 20x per toddler, 10x per child... maybe.

The next time we used this we immediately it started leaking.

Since I'm still in the midst of my vacation I'll have to find time to reach out to Coleman to see inquire what or how they'll address this.\n\nUpdate 08-26-15: After our first go round with this wash basin in 2011 I reached out to Coleman explaining the problem we encountered with the wash basin leaking and they replaced it as a one time courtesy (be aware, it doesn't carry a warranty).  Fast forward four years and the next time our family is camping and we open up the still new in package wash basin we received from Coleman we received in 2011.  Immediately out of the package it starts leaking at the same points the previous one leaked which leads me to believe it's a flaw in materials used to manufacture the wash basin.

It folds into a trinagle about 6\"Lx4\"Wx2\"H and, when extended, is about 10\" long. It has a ripple on one edge that is supposed to represent a saw built onto the blade. This shovel is very good for chipping ice in the winter time when you get your vehicle stuck. It is somewhat adequate for shoveling snow, it gets the job done but that is not what it was designed for. Have two vehicles and have one of these shovels in each. Great for when you get stuck in any other type of soil/terrain other than snow. It is great for gardening, camping, and hiking. If your are in a combat situation, this shovel is great for digging that hasty fighting postion (its intended purpose) and then improve that position with a larger shovel. This shovel, also, is great if you got to do the poo thing because you can dig a hole and fold the blade to a 90 degree position, lock it in place, set the handle on the ground with the 90 degree shovel standing up, and sit on it to use as a seat. Unfortunately, you can only place one butt cheek on the blade, that is all the room you have for. It also makes for a good, sturdy weapon against critters and such, when extended. It comes with a plastic container that attaches to your utility belt or backpack. The uses for this shovel are only limited to your imagination. The only thing that I can really say bad about this shovel is that make-believe saw on one of the blades. It is worthless and is a big joke.

Riemer", "reviewText": "I've been wilderness camping for over 26 years.  When I first started (as a Boy Scout), a folding shovel was high on my list of \"must have\" camping gear.  After purchasing one, however, and carrying it with me on a number of outings, I soon came to a different conclusion.\n\nWhy do most people want to carry a shovel? I usually hear three reasons: 1) to dig a trench around a tent, 2) to shovel ash out of the fire pit, and 3) to dig a scat hole (a hole for depositing excrement).  Let me address those three items, and then address some different types of camping or outings that may further influence your decision.\n\nTRENCHING AROUND TENTS\n----------------------\nSimply put, this is an outdated practice that causes erosion in campsites.  Trenches eventually fill and overflow, carrying off soil and altering the conditions in the site.  In fact, most campsites (and all National Parks and wilderness areas) prohibit trenching.  If you really want the floor of your tent to stay dry on the inside, purchase a tent with a tub floor (where the seams are raised off the bottom of the tend) and a good rain fly.\n\nSHOVELING ASH\n-------------\nWhile a shovel can be used to shovel ash out of a fire pit, so can small gargen trowel, a metal cup, a metal plate, or even a frying pan.  You're likely already going to be carrying a cup, plate, or pan, so there is no need to carry the extra gear (the shovel).  A large stick can be used to stir coals in an active fire, and the cookware can be rinsed with water after using it to dig out the fire pit.\n\nSCAT HOLES\n----------\nWhen digging a hole for human waste, you typically need to turn only a few inches of soil.  I've found that a garden trowel does a splendid job, and it weighs only a few ounces compared to the 2.4 lbs. of this shovel.\n\nDIFFERNT CAMPING METHODS REQUIRE DIFFERENT GEAR\n---------------------------------------------\nLet's face it, it makes a difference if you are driving into a campsite rather than hiking in.  If driving in, you are less concerned about how heavy your gear is, so a shovel like this one may be a nice luxury.  If backpacking or on any wilderness excursion where you are carrying everything you need, you feel every extra ounce you carry.  In such cases, a gardening trowel makes more sense.  You can get one made from composite plastics that is very hard and durable, but weighs only a few ounces.\n\nIn my years of experience, I found that the weight of the shovel was not worth the benefit I received from it while on wilderness treks.  However, I love keeping one of these in the trunk of my car to help dig out if I get stuck in the snow.\n\nThe Coleman folding shovel is a nice little tool.  You just need to decide if you want to carry it with you when you spend time in the wilderness.", "summary": "Great for the car--do you really need one for camping?", "unixReviewTime": 1232323200}

I vowed I would never go through that again.\n\nI went on a search for a army-like folding shovel, without the cost, as I would only be using it to clean fire pits upon arrival and departure. However, I also needed something that was easy to pack away, as I drive a \"sport-wagon\" style vehicle.\n\nThis shovel is \"perfect\" in nearly all ways. I say nearly because no product is perfect, and there will be some flaw that I dwell on (it's a bit difficult to fold initially, but you get the hang of it) that someone else won't. It fits perfectly in my vehicle's rear storage compartment, tucked above the wheel-well.\n\nIt feels sturdy, as if it was made with good materials, and I can say that it will survive many a camping trip in the future.\n\nThis shovel is not meant to dig foxholes or trenches, it just wasn't built with that in mind. It was meant for simple to moderate tasks, and if I could improve on one thing (that isn't the folding), it would be to add a pick to it, as it could then be used to help drive stakes for tents.\n\nOtherwise, it is a good buy, compare its cost to the big box retailers!", "summary": "Great Size, Foldable, Good Price!", "unixReviewTime": 1211414400}

I am 66 years old and have arthritis in both hands, so that should give you some idea of how easily it folded.  I also noticed that the three sections of the shovel wiggle at least 1/4\" back and forth even when securely locked open.  I have not attempted to actually dig with the shovel, since I am afraid that doing so will cause the three sections to fold up during use, and I could end up with injuries.\n\nTOTALLY DISAPPOINTED, RETURNING THE PRODUCT FOR REFUND.

Baker", "reviewText": "I played bocce at the beach for the first time a couple of months ago, and I was hooked.  I went home and immediately did hours of research to find the best one for the price.  This set won out in the end.  So I played with this one and another Sportcraft (100 mm black / red) one, and the quality was there for both of them, but I am satisfied that I ordered this set because of the 4 colors and the slightly larger (109mm) size.  Let me be brief --\n\nPros:\n1) high quality material\n2) weighted really nicely, nice size too\n3) 4 colors, then each 2 bocce balls of the same color are differentiated by different markings, making it possible for up to 8 different people to play. I have needed 8 balls a couple of times, so this alone has made this set worth it.\n4) Great pallino and measuring device\n\nCons:\n1)  cheap bag.  I've seen better from cheaper sets at the store.  The bag will not likely outlast the set.\n2)  Paint wear pretty quickly.\n  --Pro:  who cares?! It adds character!\n\nI enjoyed my set so much after the first few uses, that I ordered one from Amazon for my father's birthday.  He loves it, and he will be able to play it with his grandkids which shows the versatility of this game.\nBonus tip:  Free trial of Amazon prime got it to me next day with just a few bucks more.  Well worth it!\n\n****UPDATE****\nI have now owned this set for almost five years.  This is a product that has been so good, I felt obligated to revise my review.  This set has seen countless games, on the beaches of Florida, to the mountains of Colorado to the sand dunes in Southern Utah.  Bocce has become easily my most favorite outdoor game.  My wife just commented today, \"you have made a lot of friends with that game.\"  It's true, it's a great game because people don't need experience to play or have fun.  Anybody can just join in and get the hang of it.\n\nI have only owned this one set, and it has held up beautifully.  The balls now all have \"character\", with the paint being severely dulled and worn, but it doesn't affect gameplay at all.  Just as predicted, the bag is about dead, but just refuses to bust open.  It is ripping at the seams.  I'm not sure what I'll do when the bag breaks.  Maybe I can have the company send me a new one. The balls have no chips or cracks after many hard hits on rocks, concrete, and against each other, so I expect them to continue to last.  I have played with 3 other sets (not sure the manufactueres).  This one felt like the best size and weight for my throw, and the materials feel better than most.  Bottom line, the game of Bocce is tons of fun, and this set is the best I've played with.\n\nI have had many times where more than four people want to play.  Usually it is more than four but less than eight.  This is tricky, because then each person would really only have one ball to throw.  Although that is still fun, part of the skill of the game is to throw your first ball and then adjust for the second so that you get better.  If you only throw one ball, it takes away that aspect.  So I am going to get a second set so that everyone can throw at least two balls.", "summary": "Recommended for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1282867200}

As we live 1.5 hours or more from the closest saltwater beach, when we go, we stay all day.  After setting this up, folks who were leaving, stated that if they had a shelter like us, they wouldn't be leaving.  The temp was in the high 90's with nary a cloud in sight.  A great day to test out our shelter.\n\nPrior to purchasing this, we used two beach umbrellas and would need to move with the shade all day -- but if you're on a real crowded beach and your neighbors are real close, you have to move your umbrellas all day.  Either way, it's annoying, inconvenient, and can be downright dangerous if you've fallen asleep.\n\nThis eliminates almost all of that.  I say almost as we still needed an umbrella in front until later in the afternoon when the sun was mostly behind us.\n\nWe enjoyed the partial privacy afforded by blocking our view of our side neighbors.  It was very nice to take a nap and not worry about the sun moving OR feeling as though you're on display while you sleep.\n\nWe only used stakes around the edges of the shelter, we didn't feel we would need tie-out lines.  At times the wind was extremely gusty, and although we didn't use the tie-out lines, the shelter didn't go anywhere -- many beach umbrellas became projectiles and our own umbrella turned inside out -- so the wind was very strong.\n\nWe also liked having items in the shelter that were kept sand-free.  It was nice to have everything contained within the shelter.  And if you're like us, and like to go for long walks, it's nice to know that your stuff isn't exposed to everyone and the sea gulls.\n\nWe had the back window open and rolled up, for ventilation, until the sun moved back there.  Then we unhooked it, and let it hang so we'd be shaded but still have ventilation.\n\nWe are more than pleased with this shelter.  It's easy to set up, roomy, stays put in gusty winds, is easy to take down, and doesn't weigh much.

There are three poles, each about 6 to 8 feet long assembled.  The poles slide into mesh sleeves, which are less durable than nylon fabric, but prevent sand from filling the sleeves.  Just take your time during tent assembly and disassembly, do not force the rods, and the mesh should not be a problem.\n\nAs for the tent itself, it is quite large, easily fitting two adults, possible three.  In the back is a door/window with a solid panel and screen, depending upon which zipper you open (there are two on the back door, one for the nylon flap, one for the screen).  The large front door also zips shut for privacy/changing clothes.\n\nThe carry case is also nice and well made, with handles, to carry everything in a compact form.\n\nThis tent is a really great item, and I will update this review should there be any issues, which I do not foresee given the nice quality of this tent.\n\nThe tent is made in Bangladesh.\n\nUPDATE: MAY 5 2013\nWe took this to the beach, where the conditions were windy.  Set up required two adults to fight against the wind.  Total set up time must have been 10 minutes, however, once set up it provided shelter from the wind and sun.  We stayed all day at the beach until almost sunset, and without the tent the wind and sun would have forced us to leave much sooner.  Some strong gusts did occasionally push the tent sides in a bit, but they popped back out as the wind subsided.  On windy days, I would not leave the tent without a person inside to prevent it blowing away.  The included sand bags, which we used, would not have prevented the tent from blowing away.

Perhaps I got a defective unit?  Consider finding a way to keep the internal gaskets/o-rings lubricated.  Maybe that would cut down on leakage.\n- With the weight of full fuel can, it's easy to torque the two-piece design, which causes fuel to leak at the internal seal.\n- I still lost a bit of fuel while filling appliance, much less than pouring directly from a can, but enough to be annoying nonetheless.\n- No filter as far as I can tell.  That's not a problem if I'm using brand new, fresh fuel, but if I'm using older fuel (which could have contaminants or gelled globs), I could end up with a clogged appliance.\n\nI think I'll try purchasing another one to see if it's better than the first leaky one I used.

We had bought it so that my 6 month old wouldn't get too much sun when we are at the beach. I'll start off by telling you the features that we like about it.\n* It produces a good amount of shade\n* It's nice looking\n* It could double as a camping tent for a child or small adult without gear in a pinch\n* It has a floor that extends out passed the canopy.\n* If set up correctly, it is rock solid against even moderate wind. We have not been out in a storm or really heavy winds but you probably wouldn't want to be at the beach bad weather anyway.\n* The back flap can be tied open, zipped to a mosquito net, or zipped with a nylon flap.  Very versitile.\n* It packs away in a nice small, light package.\n\nThe only thing that I don't like about it is that they used a netted material to make the sleeves that the poles slide through.  I understand why they chose it and don't really know if there would have been a better material to use.  They used it so that it doesn't get full of sand and for it to dry very if wet.  However, 90% of the time assembling it you  will spend it dealing with the couplings and ends of the poles getting gigged on the netted material. If your not careful I can see how it would tear quite easily.  You have to be patient and take your time  sliding it through while helping releasing the snags as they present themselves (cause they will).  It seems as if the slower you try to do it, the faster and easier it will go.  Even with one person. Isn't that the case with most things though?\nI like the sandbags.  If you fill them up all the way and burry them in the sand the tent will be rock solid. The stakes are pretty thin and will not work in the sand obviously.  They don't seem like they will take much hammering unless it's really soft dirt.  Try attaching the filled sand bags before setting it up so you won't have to fight the wind.  Then move it where you like it and then burry the sandbags to really anchor it down.  That's how I do it and it works great.  Once up, you will love it.

For effective venting with the tent all closed up, I kept the back window unzipped at the bottom, and the front flap unzipped at the top. Even in Maui, the moving air kept the interior of the tent cool enough for comfortable napping.\n2.

Setup was a snap, about 5 minutes, and the tent was the perfect size for us.  I put our bags inside, and towels down for the baby to roll around on.\n\nI will say that if you don't open the vent in the back it does get very hot.  At certain times of day, opening the back flap let the sun in, but it was essential to get a breeze through there so the baby didn't overheat.\n\nWe only used the stakes 1 day (it was really windy), the rest of the time we used the sand pockets and it was very secure, especially with our bags and towels inside.\n\nIt's too low to actually sit inside -- we sat right our chairs on the outside of the tent in the shade, and it worked great.  I bought one for my mother and her fiance as well (he's 6'2\") and they both fit comfortably in regular folding chairs.\n\nPutting it away was pretty easy as well, we folded the tent, rolled it up, tied it, and shoved it back in the bag.  My mother spent a lot of time making it look nice and neat, but it does not affect setup and frankly I'm too lazy.  :)\n\nIf you have little ones, or plan to be outside and need some shade, I highly recommend this tent.  The baby spent most of her time in there and it was a lifesaver -- she didn't get burned at all and had a safe place to play.

Lowest the temps have gotten is in the 20's and one night it was snowing, but I stayed perfectly warm in a tent with this sleeping bag. I'm 5'9, 200, and there is plenty of room inside it for me. I don't feel cramped and my feet do not touch the end. The bag fits snug around my shoulders (but not uncomfortable tight) which helps keep in warm air throughout the night. On a few occasions, I've had to unzip the bag during the night to let cool air in. My only complaint, and it's not enough to drop a star, but the carrying bag this comes in is very small. It sometimes takes 2 people to put this sleeping bag back into the carrying case.\n\n*** Update ***\n\nAfter using this bag a few more times for camping, I've figured out how to properly roll it up so it goes into the carrying bag more easily. Start at the top of the bag and fold it in half length ways. 3/4 down the bag where it tapers to a smaller size, leave that part unfolded. As you roll the bag up, the small end should be the same width as the top half when its folded. This will reduce the thickness of the bag when rolled up, and it will go into the carrying bag much easier.\n\nAt first, I would fold the bag in half lengthways, all the way down, then roll it up. This was making it too bulky to fit properly in the bag and would take 2 people to put it in. Now, I can roll it up and have it back in the bag in about a minute.\n\nI've attached some pictures that show the dimensions of the sleeping bag rolled up in the carrying bag. This may be helpful for anyone that is planning on using this bag for backpacking, but not sure if it will be too bulky. Also, so you can see how the size of this bag compares to a larger sleeping bag, I took a picture of it laying on top of a Teton XXL sleeping bag.\n\nDimensions:\n - Length from end to face opening: 73\"\n - Width at the shoulders: 30\"", "summary": "Kept me toasty warm in 20 degree weather!", "unixReviewTime": 1498435200}

I found with this bokken over my wood bokken that it was lighter then I thought it would be more like a live blade but less like a wood bokken ( but hurts the same). My personal opinion of it, it is not great for endurance drills so that your arm muscles use the weight of the wood in both the cut and the ready stances to build up for a live blade and the faster cut with the live blade from using the wood bokken, but as I said this is very minor difference that most that buy this as there first bokken will not know. I still have and use my wood bokkens for drills and solo training, but when it comes down to sparing I use this mostly because of  the fact of I have had a Japanese White Oak bokken shatter on me that was a $50 dollar bokken, and everyone thinks that price is everything... I will NEVER give anything 5 out of 5 to be honest, nothing is perfect, but this is really really close to a VERY good all around bokken.\n\nUpdate\nI have had the same one I ordered here now for a few years, I have beaten the (put choice word here you wish to use) out of it, even against wood bokkens. other then a few dents along the front edge that it has gotten because of this, it still lives.

This is the 1st polypropylene Cold Steel product I've ever owned, so I was quite surprised & impressed on how sturdy it was, being made out of hard plastic; yet it gave a bit of flex, but in the end retained it's shape. {My mind wondered off today and it slid outta my hands and created a small dent in the wall (lol) good thing no one else was in the room.}\n\n-> First thing I noticed (out the box) was the 'Tsuba' and the 'Tsuba Ring' (not sure of the technical term for the rubber ring) came in a separate plastic pouch with clear instructions and pictures for assembly. Just note that it'll take some muscles to assemble the Tsuba onto the bokken. I left mine off for storage purposes.\n\n-> Gave it a few nice hard whacks during the day today, & it didn't deform at all until due, to my retarded-ness, it slipped out of my hands and flew into a wall. Gave my wall a nice little dent and had a bit of plastic curve over on the tip (like how the edge of a knife curves due to use), not really noticeable but it's visible under close inspection. Also, unlike a wooden bokken, when it breaks it won't splinter.\n\n-> Haven't gotten to really putting it under a ton of use and pressure, but for the price of $20.80 (at least that's the price of my purchase) it's totally worth the cash.\n\nTotally recommend this product to anyone looking for a quality bokken for either their training or just as a decorative piece for the wall.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUPDATE (March 6th, 2015):\nI've put the tsuba and the rubber ring that holds it in place on the bokken a day or two ago just to try out how that felt. Today, just got back from work, thought I'd play with it a bit, took it out and found out the Tsuba Ring broke on me. If I had to describe how it broke, I'd say it was more like someone took a knife and cut it down one side, the break is clean & smooth.

Me and my wife have been smacking these around about as much as you would in a tournament, and they are barely even scuffed.\n\nThe only removable part would be the handguard, or tsuba (but this is Murica, so I'm gonna use English).  The handguard is pretty tough to slip into its place, but not impossible.  The O-ring keeps it on really well, too.  ALMOST no slippage, although after a couple of bouts it does come out of place a very little bit.\n\nThe grip is really comfortable.  HOWEVER, when your hands start sweating it does get a little slippery, but I would recommend gloves and other safety gear anyway, so no complaint here.  It also weighs and handles really closely to my katana, and it has the proper amount of flexibility as a sword should.  If you were to get struck by this in training, there wouldn't be as much damage done as a wooden bokken, although you will feel it for sure (especially the fingers, but that's what gloves are for).\n\nAs a whole, I'm really glad I bought these.

I estimate it takes up 30L of space in it's stuff sack.\n\nSecond off, this bag is heavy. It's heavier than my tent, heavier than my backpack. It's actually the heaviest thing in my pack. That's somewhat to be expected as a cheap zero-degree bag, but let's observe that...\n\nThis is not a zero-degree bag. I took it on several camping trips with a low of 32F. It is only comfortable if you're fully dressed: multiple layers, jacket, two pairs of socks and a beanie. This last trip I went without the jacket and only wore one pair of thick wool socks, and was miserably cold all night. Note that this was 32F, and had the aid of a thermal reflecting sleeping pad. The description boasts comfort down to 15F. I'd argue probable survival at those temps, but not a cozy night.\n\nI was prepared to make some sacrifices in weight to save money and still be warm, but in the end I was disappointed in all regards.\nI would rate 1 star, but I must admit that it is warmer than my 40F Summer bag, and at least on this last trip I didn't die or lose extremities to frostbite.

I expect these to last a long time and be warm enough for anything except winter camping.

In early spring and late fall the temperatures can get pretty low. I had decided that I wanted a mummy bag previously and began searching for something around the 20+ degree range. I stumbled upon this bag and given its price thought that it would make a good purchase. I believe I made the right choice.\n\nPros - This bag is warm. While the description states that it is a \"0-Degree\" bag, I would not suggest using it in that type of weather. A lot of individuals see that and believe that they could sleep in 0-degree weather comfortably. That is not the case. My guess is that this bag would be comfortable around 30-degrees. I have not yet had it out in weather that cold so I cannot say for sure. Furthermore, in weather that cold I typically place a couple of body or hand warmers in the bag with me. You could also use a sleeping bag liner which would make this bag warmer as well. For most individuals camping in typical camping weather, this bag will be more than enough.\n\nIn order to reach that 0-degree rating, the bag has a considerable amount of insulation inside of it. This makes it fairly comfortable to sleep in. I use a self-inflating sleeping pad when I hike. The combination of the bag and the pad made for a relatively comfortable nights sleep.\n\nCons - As stated above, the warmth and comfort is achieved through a generous amount of insulation. This also results in the bag being fairly heavy and bulky. You will have a difficult time attempting to stuff this into a backpack (I use a Teton 5200 and I cannot fit it into the sleeping bag compartment. Instead I put it in the main compartment and put my clothes in the sleeping bag compartment).

I was initially looking to buy an inexpensive sleeping bag for my brother since he didn't have one, but I ended up giving him my old Wenzel bag and decided to purchase a newer one for myself.  I didn't want to spend a lot of money, but I didn't want something that was only going to last for one season before falling apart either.  This Coleman bag fit the bill nicely.\n\nSince I was pretty much looking to use this particular bag for car camping excursions or short backpacking trips, I wasn't as concerned about the weight or bulk of the bag as I normally would be.  I like the Coleman brand in general, and while it's definitely not on par with the higher end brand names like The North Face, Marmot, etc., their products do serve their purpose as long as you understand and accept their limitations for what they're worth.  This bag is probably too bulky for any real backpacking trips, but throw it in the car and it's great for car camping and base camp.  I liked the look of the bag and especially the extra \"toe space\" this bag provided.  After hanging the bag up for a day and letting it air out (just to ensure there would be no chemical odors and to allow the bag to \"loft up\") I jumped in and my brother and I each tested it out and compared it to my old Wenzel Windy Pass 0-degree Mummy Bag from 2008.  While both bags offered similar features and comfort, I much prefered the zippers on this Coleman bag and found the anti-snag feature interesting.  Overall, I found this bag to be comfortable and worth the price.\n\nTemperatures on our camping trip dropped down to the low 50's at night so I can't really attest to how warm the bag COULD be in colder weather, but it was perfectly comfortable on this particular trip.  Initially I found the bag too hot and had to unzip it open, but eventually zipped myself back in as I cooled down and ended up sleeping very well each night of our trip in long underwear in this bag.  The stuff sack included with the bag is rather large, and I'm not sure why other reviewers found it difficult to pack it back in.  I carefully rolled my bag up and packed it in an even smaller compression sack in effort to save space in my car trunk (there were 4 of us camping with all my gear packed in my Mazda3, so space was at a premium) but it would have been a cinch to just stuff it back into its own included carry sack.\n\nOverall, a good purchase but like others have said, probably not the sleeping bag you'd want to bring with you on backpacking trips due to its size.  Great for car camping, base camp, sleepovers, or any other times that space and weight are not an issue.  In those situations you'll probably want to get a higher end sleeping bag for that purpose.", "summary": "Good sleeping bag for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1324166400}

It's NOT awesome for backpacking. TOO huge. TOO heavy. But I figured it was a short hike so I could manage.

The next trip was even less work. We slept on the side of the road in Big Sur. That night I zipped in and hunkered down and the next morning I zipped out but barely. The zipper was caught and it just wasn't going anywhere. And that's where it's at now. The zipper is just broken. No reason for it at all.

My waterbottle and my dog's water bowl both completely froze throughout as did the condensation on the outside of my tent, and my car was a big ice block when I got back to it in the morning.  The bag actually did pretty well.  I pulled the face hole as tight as I could and just cuddled down inside the bag without sticking my face out (it was too cold if I put my face out).  I have Raynaud's disease and my hands/nailbeds often are very cold and turn blue in cold weather from poor circulation, but they were nice and warm inside the bag without extra gloves on.  I was impressed by that.  Overall I was ok, but not as warm and comfortable as I would have been at home in my own bed of course.  It did it's job and kept my appendages warm enough and me alive in what could have been hypothermia conditions without the proper gear.  My only real gripe about this bag is that it is huge when it's rolled up.  It's too big to fit into the sleeping bag compartment of my NorthFace backpacking pack (so I imagine it's too big for any), and it takes up a very large portion of the pack when stuffed in the only way it will fit.

The reason is that underneath the handle is a very small piece of metal that connects to the blade itself. (Called the Tang) In a real martial arts sword, the tang is normally a thick piece of metal that is almost the thickness of the sword itself. If you swing a wallhanger too often or too hard it can break at the tang, and fly off and hurt someone.\n\nIf you want to learn more about how dangerous these wallhangers are do a google search on the words: anatomy of a wallhanger\n\nAny sword designed for real martial arts practice- like Iaido, starts at $250 not $15, and should be bought at a reputable Iaido store. (sorry I am not allowed to recommend web sites here).\n\nSo be smart, either hang this sword back on the wall, or throw it out before your baby brother/sister hurts someone.", "summary": "Dangerous", "unixReviewTime": 1148688000}

Just keep feeling how easy it is to move and adjust them as you slowly tighten more and more and they will be perfectly adjusted. The slightly parabolic view helps get a wide angle view of traffic.

The Mirrycle is engineered with male hex bolts that screw into micro-tapered female brass pieces that become tighter and tighter as you screw the hex bolt in place. Yes, it is a bit difficult to screw the hex bolt into place with the hex key (provided) but what you get when you're finished is a rearview mirror on your handlebar that does not jiggle. Yes, it bounces as the handlebar bounces--can't avoid the physics of bicycle riding--but all the jiggle in the mirror is eliminated.

The glass mirror pivots and stays where you want it, until it gets bumped too hard, where it will swing away. Nice feature to prevent breakage.

As mentioned by numerous reviews, the screws drive hard to the point that you think you're actually cracking the plastic plus the included Allen wrench requires some strength to turn. But not to worry. Read the instructions and theyll confirm the hard drive and that you will not crack the plastic. I didn't try WD40 or any other lubricant so cannot say if that would ease the assembly.\n\nI installed the Mirrycle onto a GT hybrid bicycle and after using a Dremel tool to create an opening in the end of my handle grip I found the handlebar opening accepted the smaller of the two wedges for mounting. I chose to follow the alternative down and under installation mentioned on Amazon reviews which is quite clever and works very well however I believe you may get a better site picture using the normal above and to the side installation which would facilitate not having to move your eyes so far from your frontal path to do so. The primary disadvantage to the normal up-and-out installation is that the mirror really sticks out there very exposed and if/when you dump your bike or ride close to any shrubs, etc., your mirror will be the early casualty, plus the storage shed where we keep our bikes is small which would necessitate tucking the mirror in upon each return. Do whichever works best for you.\n\nFrom the lower mounting position I could see both myself and directly behind me but I don't believe that provides the maximum field of view. On my initial trip I stopped a couple times to adjust the mirror in a similar manner to what you would do with a car, i.e., if you can see part of yourself/your bike in the mirror, tilt it out just a little further until you cant and that should be about right. Once adjusted properly you only need to tilt your head a tad one way to see either part of yourself directly behind the mirror or a tad the other way to see much more of the road to your direct left.\n\nI was amazed at how solid this mirror rode exhibiting absolutely no jitter or vibration. The large convex shape  offered a wide, clear field of view which allowed me not only to see what was coming from behind me but also what was to the near left rear of me as well.\n\nThis was only my first day with this product but Im impressed with the quality and the flexible mounting options it offers.", "summary": "Recommended", "unixReviewTime": 1489795200}

Not surprising, I guess, since they pretty much nailed it the first time. The mirror is large enough to provide an excellent view of the whole road behind. Unlike smaller mirrors, or helmet-mounted mirrors, this model doesn't require your head to be in exactly the right position to see the road behind you. No way cars will sneak up on you with this model. Installation is very simple, and adjustment is almost as easy as adjusting side mirrors on a car (although you'll probably want to use a tool to really tighten it into position once its angled exactly as you want it). As I mentioned, durability for me has been outstanding. The arm holds the mirror out a few inches from the end of the handlebar, which is great for visibility, but if you ride narrow trails with trees or cliffs really tight on the sides, there's a chance you'll scrape the mirror on obstacles from time to time. I've had this happen, but I just twist the mirror back into position. Great visibility, outstanding durability, inexpensive.

I tried grinding the starter thread because it would not start more than a 1/2 turn.\nThen I remembered what I had read when I ordered it and looked at the instructions. The tight threads are this way by design. This allows you to adjust the mirror while riding so that you can get it exactly where you want it. The alternative would be very difficult. You would have to adjust then ride, then adjust and re-adjust every time it would get moved. Or the screws would back out when the mirror gets turned.\nThe mirror will allow you to see oncoming traffic on both sides of the road or, regardless of whether you riding with or against traffic, because it has a wide field of view.\n\nAn excellent value for the money. The only thing I would like to see different is the type of plastic. The plastic in the mirror mount I bought is hard and probably brittle. I suspect it will break if I drop the bike or otherwise strike the mount with any appreciable force. The brittle, hard plastic is no doubt necessary to facilitate the tight threads so the female threaded portion won't come loose or break free inside the plastic when tightening.\nA think a better but no doubt more expensive design would incorporate some flexibility to avoid breakage.", "summary": "Well designed, a smart purchase.", "unixReviewTime": 1470787200}

I feel much safer riding, this mirror gives me a great view of what is behind me without constantly having to look over my shoulder.  It actually works better than I expected, but to be honest, for the price I did not expect much, so I was pleasantly surprised. (Which is always nice)\n\nWhat you should know:\n\nAs much as I like it, you should know that the instructions are not very good and when assembling it, it felt like it was going to break.  The screws don't seem to be a very good fit.  Don't get me wrong, they do fit, it does end up okay, but it was VERY hard to tighten and it kept feeling like it was going to crack or break while putting it together.  The instructions were not very clear, but I figured it out.  Once installed, it seems great.  I have only had it on for about a week or so, but so far, no complaints and I am very happy with this purchase.\n\nPS: Some people said they had to mutilate their handles to get it on.  That was NOT the case for me.  I have a Trek mountain bike and the end of the handle had a plastic cap I was able to remove very easily and the mirror mount fit in perfectly and tightened on perfectly.

There are really only two small issues that keep me from giving it 5 stars:  It's nearly impossible to adjust the mirror while riding--there are cap screws holding everything tight--so it took some trial and error to find the best position.  And because it's small and right on the end of the handlebar, it took some experimenting to find a position that wouldn't show my a lot of my forearm at the expense of overtaking vehicles.  But knowing what I know now, I'd gladly buy it again.", "summary": "Good little mirror", "unixReviewTime": 1438646400}
