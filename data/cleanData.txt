I own several watches two of them Invictas one a Black Face Professional Diver and the other a model that looks like a Rolex Yacht Master with rose gold face and bezel Both to these are automatics and have been running well for over two years now I recently splurged 2K and purchased a Tag Heuer Aquaracer Calibre 5 automatic that looks almost identical to this Invicta I proudly wear the Tag daily but if I am going some where a little gamey I wear an Invicta looks just as nice to the unknowning and if lost stolen broken or taken in a robbery it is no great loss The only problem with the Invicta is the bracelet isnt 110th as nice as the real McCoy and the power reserve is limited I have to reset and rewind almost daily when waking up if I am wearing one while the Tag will stay running for a day and a half when fully wound Invictas are truly the King of the Throw Away watches 
For the price you cannot beat this automatic watch The picture does not do justice The blue is stunning I have received several compliments whenmi wear this watch Goes well with casual or business wear 
I havent owned this watch for too long but I will give my impressions and if necessary update it later on For my sports watches I use Timex for my every day watch Ive been using a Traser H3 P6600 httpwwwamazoncomTraserMILGType6P660041F1301dpB003WD1894refsr11ieUTF8qid1331357599sr81 I love that watch and Ive used it for everything surfing running swimming etc The only problem is that it is very tacticallooking and not very dressy Thats why I bought the Invicta 9094 After resizing this with a hammer and pin tool httpwwwamazoncomWatchLinkRemoverHammerHolderdpB003YJ4RYOrefpdsimmisc3 which was 542 with free shipping I put it on and showed my girlfriend a picture of a Rolex Submariner next to my watch She was impressed with how similar they look Here goes my proscons Pros Amazingly good looking looks like the Rolex beautiful blue face Less than 100 Automatic no battery required but if you dont wear it it will stop Features Luminous hands and numbers rotating bezel Cons Havent beaten it up enough yet to say anything bad about it 
great product accurate description and a fare price i love the brand they make excellent timepieces like the look the feel and mostly the price 
This is the second watch of this particular model I bought The first one has been running great for the last two years and I had no hesitation in buying another one for my dad Unfortunately I realized something was wrong with this watch the moment I took it out of the box All Automatic watches need a couple of turns of the winder to get them started The winder on this one offered no resistance what so ever That in itself was a clue to a bigger problem Once the watch gets an initial wind it supposed to be able to wind itself as you move around This watch stopped within 5 minutes I wore it for two days trying to give it enough wind to keep it going but it still stopped 30 minutes after I took it off Since the first watch wasis running flawlessly its safe to assume that this is simply lack of manufacturers quality control Therefore I will be ordering a replacement once my purchase has been refunded 
Excellent product I am very happy with the purchase arrived quickly and was what I expected The watch is very beautiful and elegant was a great gift 
I purchased this for my husband as an anniversary gift He is so pleased and cant stop looking at it When Iasked him for a comment to include here he saidOOO La La This watch is authentic and accurately describedpictured by Amazon Packaging of the watch itself was meticulously done The band clasp front  back were all encased in a clear protective film It was easy to check the quality and try on the watch prior to removing any of the protective wrap I highly recommend this piece for purchase 
got this last week liked it so much I got 2 more I have about 60 invictas have not had a bad one yet This one looks great and is keeping good time 
A little history first about 5 years ago I bought an Invicta 8926 to get started in the world of automatic watches It lived up to the rave reviews I had read online and I was very pleased with its quality and performance However 5 years is about the shelf life for any automatic watch before an overhaul is necessary it employs a mechanical engine after all This costs anywhere from 150 to 200 and its a procedure just as necessary to keep a Rolex running well as a Seiko or well an Invicta Along with needing routine servicing my old Invicta had become pretty beat up from years of hard usecamping hiking rafting swimming and so onand much as I like the watch I just couldnt justify spending two to three as mucch on repairs as I originally paid for the watch So I decided to get a new Invicta but wanted something a little different than the classic Submariner look and thought Id take a chance on this model Ive had it for a week and am very impressed The scalloped bezel and markings on the bezel insert are derived from the design of Omega dive watches and so offer a variation on the Rolex theme The 9094 is not exactly original but it is unique insofar as it combines features from several classic dive watch styles Also as far as I know the gleaming rather than brushed center links of the bracelet are a feature unique to Invicta dive watches I think its a great touch It also looks like Invicta has made some improvements over the years in terms of design The crown guards are much less clunky than on my 8926 and it sounds like the rotor spins much more easily The latter is just my impression Also the face of the 9094 picks up the light beautifully and like other reviewers I have to say that pictures simply dont do the watch justice Its running very accurately a bit fast perhaps but this is par for the course for mechanical watches and it should settle down in the next couple of months I have one complaint the bezel was pretty stiff out of the box but a couple of drops of TriFlow lubricant placed in the seam between the bezel and the body of the watch loosened it up nicely All in all I highly recommend this watch At 70 and with free shipping its an astonishing deal for a high quality timepiece 
This is my everyday watch It is good looking wellmade for the price and durable thus far Only con is that it seems to gain couple seconds a day therefore at the end of the month it is about minute or two fast  I suppose its better than being slow but this is expected from a nonquartz movement type of watches that use unadjusted automatic movement Its a tradeoff for not having the need to replace the battery every few years If you are like me and like to wear different watches for different occasions automovement watches can be a pain unless you invest in autowinder or two I disagree with some people I think Invicta watches in general I have several Invictas have decent bands that are nicely finished and have sufficient heft to them Compared to comparable Seiko 5 automatic watches Seikos have cheap light weight rough feel to them although the Seiko 5 are also a good choice for a daily beater  their bands tend to give out long before their automovements do These Pro Diver series that ape RolexOmega design are the ones that put Invicta on the map in the watch world Although the style is easy to copy customer service apparently is not as noted by many user here and other watch forums But then if I get several years of troublefree use out them Im happy If you want the legendary service you gonna have to pony up for a real thing Rolex through its authorized dealer 
the watch works great and looks great only problem is it runs fast about 30 seconds a day 
This is cool Keeps the dust off of my board but the color in the picture is NOT what was shipped to me Either way it serves its purpose 
This is a great lowcost solution for protecting your 10 footer from dings during transit and from the sun while at the beach Mine came in different colors that what is shown here but a quality product overall 
Great board sock Fits well over my sixties style ten footer with the fin in Has a nose guard for added protection 
This watch is very nice looking and has a solid feel to it So far its keeping very accurate time It is a bit chunky so if you have overly small wrists it may be a little bit big but I have smaller wrists 675 inches and I can get by wearing it Three negatives it is a hair puller and the edges could be a bit smoother and the clasp is impossible to open for me unless I use something sharp to POP it open I have fingernails and its still difficult to open Overall a great watch for the money and the packaging is beautiful EDIT on a side note do NOT expect good service from Invicta They do not answer emails do a search they are known for ignoring emails Once the sale is made they could care less so be prepared The koolaid drinking Invicta lovers either A had to never deal with them on a service issue or B are so brainwashed they look the other way I sent them over 10 emails over a 2 month period and not ONE reply I am not alone These companies that do not reply to email should just get rid of their email system ShopNbc also has a special email address for Invicta customers and same thing no responses whatsoever I had to email Citizen twice and both times I got a response in less than an hour From now on I will only by from companies who respond to a customer Just a forewarning 

looks good in my trunk of my car I might use it when I get my property in the woods came as advertised but for a light tree branch if you are trying to climb to higher structures make sure you are using a bigger rope in my case I will be using for throwing safety lines in small exercises 
Absolutely love this grappling hook Nice rope nice metal and the hooks fold down for easy storage 
Okay 
HIGHLY DANGEROUS do not buy I owned one of these for all of one day Fell apart on me as I was climbing a tree with it The hooks slide on to a bolt and the top of that bolt unscrews andor just pops off while you are climbing This item will get you hurt How have they not been sued yet 
Fantastic product Worked exactly as described Shipping was fast Packaged nicely Great seller great product 
Purchased these for friends Theyve spent hours on our dock treasure hunting the bottom of the lake Fast shipping 
it grabs on to things pretty good the rope is super skinny so its hard to climb things and so i cant really find much use of it anymore 
THANKS FOR FAST MAILING AND LOVE IT THANKS FOR PACKING GOOD 
Junk Very tweaked Purchased this to pull branches out of a small pond Broke on first use 
just what I needed to pull a big fir limb off a roof  
It works just fine it seems I wouldnt call it anything special The only reason for three stars instead of 5 is just because the hook comes out of place too easily and I am hesitant about using it with some weight because of the stories I heard from this specific one 
Made in China need I say more 
Amazing product 
IT WORKS ITS MAGIC AND IM HAPPY ABOUT THIS BUY 
Kid like 
Right On 
Strong and well built 
Works as it should 
its OK pretty cheap really but if you need a way to grab and pull on something like a tree limb it works good I wouldnt use it to climb up 
Another gift I got for my friend as part of a ninja theme hes too large to use this properly but maybe one day it will save him from trouble or hell save gotham or something 
Great hook easy assembly and simple use I do feel the rope is a little thin though Makes it harder to climb without a carabiner 
So far so good Used to drag debris from stream 
I used this to climb trees and accidentally left it out for a few months returned to find it still in good shape and perfect working order still 
Like it 
Good 
This is so cool Perfect for adventurous boys 
Alright I was definitly hesitant buying this One for me and my friend so i Bought them Your going to need some type of grip shoe and gloves cause damn its hard to climb using this so we knotted the rope 1 per every 4ft and 6 inch works good and i still have also good weapon ever in case of an emergency 
Great for kids my son loves it 
It doesnt fold quite as easily as expected and the rope is very thin and hard to climb also the black paint from the rope got all over my hands and legs 
Bought this while black out drunk wasnt disappointed Came in the mail and I had no idea what I had ordered When I opened it I laughed for a while Put it together and its a quality grappling hook has a nice weight to it so you can toss it pretty far Had to put a different rope on it because it was slick nylon cord and hard to grip 
Very dangerous since this is only strong enough for ninjas who weigh below 70 lbs which make them close to starving A starving ninja is useless in combat especially against a blind Sumo warrior 
This is an awesome thing to show off I havent used it for anything yet dont really plan to However I pride myself on being prepared for anything so when the only tool for the job is a grappling hook Ill be ready 
first off the mural hook folds up so that both hooks are parallel to each other when you need to turn it into a bureau hug you simply screw it all the way up and then it locks the string is a little thin for my taste for climbing so I tie small knots in it to get a better grip its got great lengths to it not that heavy is very well made I couldnt believe when it came the price that I paid for it it could easily have been 50 or 60 if I was looking for one of the flea market 
I got a great deal on this used It should work as specified Heavy so I wouldnt want to carry this around with me for any long distances 
This is dope as hell 
Fun My son age 9 enjoyed playing with the metal grappling hook with sturdy rope too 
looks cool but i cant even assemble it the holes are too big and there not even threaded so i cant assemble it i would try to make the threads myself but like i said the holes are too big so even if i did it wouldnt even work This is a SCAM and a piece of garbage waste of money DO NOT BUY THIS 
I bought this to attach to my full body harness backpack system I keep it in hand while walking trails in areas with sink holes If I am about to slip or fall into a hole I can throw this around the nearest tree or tree roots so that I will not fall far into any hole making escape much easier 
I use this to clean moss from pond You need to add extra cotton rope and attach to bank Use knots about 10 times as moss sticks to them Also clean 2 prongs and rest slides off Look for tadpoles and return 
he loves it bought this as a gift and he has climbed every tree in the area including the tree with poison oak strong reliable when the hook sets correctly he took several attempts before he got the hang of it loves it 
I bought this so I could achieve my goal of becoming Batman Im one step closer All I need is to get in shape and to get a batmobile and Ill be all set 
I keep it in my car for emergencies or as an anchor for climbing I weigh 150lbs If you weigh more dont use it for saving yourself If you want to be a PSEUDO Cracker Ninja then it is worth it 
I bought a pair of these for my wife and I to keep with our bugout gear Great for scaling walls then hooking your gear and dragging it up and over Folds almost flat when not it use Plenty strong to hoist my 165 pounds 
wicked little grappling hook quick shipping hook itself seems pretty sturdy but the rope is junk buy yourself a good length of line from harbor freight 
Baught this for some back yard fun So far its been fine No broken screws or bent pieces Really happy with the build quality Rope isnt the greatest but if your auctually planning on using this to climb I would recommend on changing it any ways 
This is heavy so not a cheaply made hook It was bigger heavier and more durable than I thought it would be Works great and made my 10 year olds day 
This is a nice product with strong quality rope that has supported my weight of 235 pounds with no problem 
Bought this as a Christmas gift for my son Hes been asking for one for years He loves it Climbs on everything now 
i use it at work for when a branch falls out of reach it has made my job easier also good for dragging branchs out the water would not trust it with alot of weight or even me scaling a wall like a ninja 
its ok for the price of the grappling hook  its acceptable for the price  not sure if it will work 
Does the Job Great for the Price Working As Expected Would recommend to a stranger friend family member old high school sweetheartetc 
I feel like a ninja now kidding Last year a wounded deer drowned in my pond and I swam out to pull it out nearly froze my  off No more with this thing 
Threw it up and bent on the first try a few more throws and the entire core bent It landed on grass each time and I probably threw it upwards of 30ft I bought thid to get a copter out if a tree no good 
Bought this for my mom for retrieving lures in the lake that get caught on stuff Good strong rope and gets caught easily on just about anything Arrived much sooner than expected Appreciate the low price and shipping 
I EXPECTED MORE OUT OF PRODUCT HOOKS DO NOT FOLD AROUND SHAFT DONT RECALL ANY INFORMATION FROM SELLER CONCERNING HOW THE HOOKS ARE FOLDED IN RELATION TO THE SHAFT ALL THAT SAID IT SEEMS TO BE BUILT FOR ITS PURPOSEWILL DEFINITELY INFO SELLER OF ANY NEGATIVE LOADBEARING RESULT AFTER REASONABLE LOAD TESTING I DO FEEL CONFIDENT THAT IT WAS A WISE INVESTMENT FOR THE PRICE 
I really like it just what I wanted looks good works good and I like having a push button to operate 
Works exactly as described Machining could be a little better but overall this item will perform exactly as described Works for me 
But Im using this to lumberjack with Those pesky trees that lean the wrong way This and my 361 will help em down MY way Four stars because the acorn nut on top is crap and the cap blew through Was going to use jam nuts to secure but decided I dont need it to fold so I eliminated the spring and put in spacers instead Yes it folds nearly flat The whole thing is now wrench tight on both threaded areas and feels really solid For my purposes white or orange rope would have been great But Ill just change it the first time I saw through it DO NOT TRUST THE NUT as is But Id buy again at the same price 
so far it has done its job contrary to other negative comments i have not encounter any problem so far 
This is definitely cool something Stewie Griffin would possess in his box of things I want one but Im certain it wont hold my 300lbs of big bones and muscle LOL For the price I wouldnt risk anyones life with it 
I used this hook about 10 times snagging beaver cuttings from my pond It worked great The rope is tangle free too However when I encountered a clump of bull rush roots it did hook it firmly but when I retreived the hook it was bent at the joining bolt I since welded them together thus eliminating the colapsing feature I havent had any problems since I would be pressed to say that it would not bend it you tried to scale a wall though 
Husband likes the fact that it folds down and came with the rope too Gives him a little extra that way Said its great having it with the other items I got for him to add to his repelling and climbing gear 
bought this for kids to climb small walls Wouldnt put much more than 100lbs weight on it Rops is only not quality climbing rope Wouldnt buy again for 19 1015 is more like it 
I can say this is durable and works well My genius husband tossed it about 20 feet up into a tree and climbed up as far as he could He weighs about 210 and it held him fine We had to get a ladder though to get it down since he had thrown it too far out on the branch 
Fun to mess about with something like this except if youre caught climbing around at night police will classify this as a burglary tool and a weapon The rope is much too thin to climb so this has almost no practical use Only good as a decoration or costume piece for halloween 
I love this grappling hook Its better quality than I expected for the price Im not going to try to climb with it but I wouldnt hesitate to try it seems so sturdy The only think Im wanting to know is how to tie the knot like the picture Im stuck with a ordinary double knot here But seriously just buy it 
Cheap and easy to use while hiking and climbing Make sure others are clear when you throw Worked great at Devils Lake WI and Starved Rock IL 
but not bad for a small cheap anchor or for grabbing hold of debris to pull it clear searching for IEDs Dump the rope and use 550 parachute cord It will also pull down barbed wire from the top of a wall or you can use it to open a gate without exposing yourself Dont try hooking it up to a vehicle though cuz then it will come apart It folds to make a nice flat package but it definitely aint a SMALL package 
The item was very useful last week when I was trying to gain access to a balcony so I could see my girlfriend Unfortunately she was in the way when I threw it up It stuck even after she angrily pitched it across the street On the negative side she broke up with me On the plus side Im now in a relationship with the girl who lives on the fourth floor across the street Thank you Ninja Gear 
No its not titanium alloy or militarygrade aircraft aluminum but it works The rope is garbage for climbing but you can use it for something else and I got some good rope for pretty cheap at Home Depot This hook works welljust dont throw it too hard against a hard surface as it may bend a bit If youre going to be doing tossandclimb with it I recommend wrapping the hooks in a layer of cloth so as to reduce the shock on the hook if it makes a sharp impact and to reduce noise All in all a good cheap fun little tool Ive scaled a few different buildings with it I do recommend tying rungs every 2 feet or so in your climbing rope to make it easier to climb 
This item is amazing I love it Ive used it for everything from gathering firewood from a dead tree with branches high outofreach to ziplining 
As expected So perfect 
My 7 year old son is hitting balls against the garage wall and these are perfect They bounce well but wont break anything when he misfires The 3 packs are expensive but the 60 pack is a great deal Wish there was a dozen pack for a reasonable price 
they are the best type of tennis balls to use for jrs and those working on fundamentals in their forehand and back hand strokes 
I was surprised how responsive this ball is I use it to practice my Pickleball strokes and volleys on the garage wall Well made very predictive bounce No sign of breakdown of material yet Great investment 
Excellent buy and can be used for a variety of uses 
Excellent to hit against the garage door 
Best foam balls for outdoors  indoorsperioddont look anywhere for foam balls to play tennis They are pretty durable and almost same size as regular tennis ball compare to other big foam balls 
I originally purchased these balls as a learning aid for our young children but as it turns out I use them myself more than anything because Im able to hit them against a garage door and they dont leave any dents or marks Ive hit them with my hardest serves and the balls hold up just fine and the garage door still looks brand new These are great for being able to get some hits in when nobody is available to go to the courts with me 
Second time we have bought these for our now toddler was an infant These balls are sized perfect for little hands bounce enough and are built for a long time of enjoyment For something under 10 these cant be beat 
You cant really see but these are the smaller version of the foam balls that you would use with a Quick Start tennis program I just really have one question why are these balls so expensive everywhere I mean you have to buy them they are essential for me to teach beginners as a beginning tennis instructor but why are these balls 3  each everywhere So a 3 star review because I think these balls are great from a developmental perspective for a beginning tennis player but the price is crazy 
I purchased these balls after using them at a city court where an instructor was using them for some lessons He let me use them after watching me try to teach our five year old with regular tennis balls These are much lighter than a normal ball and they move at a pace that allows young kids to actually react to the ball and hit them over the net They have really been fun to use and both our three and five year olds are able to hit them They are expensive but have been worth it from an instructional perspective 
Affordable and very very functional I use these for indoor tennis same rules but on a smaller court and I love them They are super easy on the elbowsshoulders and you dont have to hit them hard at all Great symmetry they fly straight and have a good outer shell As a PE teacher is this so important foam balls do not hurt when they hit someone in the eye even girls Also they are good for floor hockey lacrosse and baseballcatch I recommend these for any tennis enthusiasts or someone looking for a good quality foam tennisbaseball 
Was looking for something to help ease the discomfort of scoliosis in my lower back while I lay in my hospital bed which is for a long time since Im bedridden Someone suggested putting a foam tennis ball under the area of my back where the discomfort occurs So I came across these foam tennis balls I purchased 3    theyre just soft enough but hold their shape well These foam tennis balls solved my discomfort problems associated with my lower back scoliosis perfectly I need this particularly specific item because my physical health problems dictate it My physical issues are due to a neuromuscular diseasedisorder supposedly supported by MDA that is both debilitating and degenerative It involves the progressive loss of coordination and muscle strength leading to motor incapacitation and the inevitable confinement to a wheelchair In my experience MDA is a JOKE I have learned that MDA attempts to make everyone believe that they are out to help people like me but instead exploit us for their own selfish monetary gain During my lifetime of 45 years realistically MDA hasnt done anything for my diseasedisorder  not even a simple treatment 
Nothing came off onto the food They did what they were supposed to do and everyone was happy especially the wife 
Love these cables Only improvement would be to make the plugs more compact to work better in stereo cabinets without a bunch of extra space behind the receiver 
These are awesomeLove of the velcro that holds the knicker at the top of the calf My other sets use a loop and closure that always seems to come undone So these are the best knickers I own 
very good material size fits well and so cool people love them and so do I I dont play golf these take the place of cargo shorts so buy them you wont be sorry worth every penny 
I bought these tubes because there light and WOW are they thin or what Well the only draw back is I put them on with my 700cc x20 continental 4000 gt black chilli powder tires which maximum pressure is 160 psi Well I filled them up to about that pressure and accidently steped on a pothole and poped You know how it poped The tube whent trough the protective rubber my rim had and went trough the litle hole where the spoke is located Too much pressure for a thin tube maybe But its still a great comp tube 
I have been riding on these tubes for two years now about 5 thousand miles and got my first flat with them earlier this week and it was a pinch flat when I hit a large pot hole going about 22mph Im pleased with them I race on them No problems I ride a trek madone 52 and weigh 145 pounds 
Well I do like Michilin products and they have worked well for me I do use these on my road bike and they seem to work fine I have had one legitimate flat on these splinter on road went through tire and straight into tube and have also cause flats on these by manhandling the presta valve when filling tires in a hurry If you are not so careless these are really good tubes otherwise get the cheaper heavier not by very much to the average guy more sturdy Michilin AirStop tubes 
I bought two of these at Performance bike shop because they were on sale Smooth stems looked nice Both of them came apart at the seam One lasted a few miles from home another lasted little longer but otherwise more walking distance to home I had a patch kit and a pump but no use At least I got refund when took them back to the store I explained the store clerk what had happened and he wasnt even surprised I had different brands of tubes mostly cheap store brand in the past but nothing compare to this I was very surprised because this happened to wellknown name What I learned from this 1 Dont buy anything says ultra light 2 Dont buy anything only because its a wellknown brand name it was probably made by another company I weigh 140lbs so the weight wasnt an issue just in case you are wondering I inflated it 120psi Size of the tire was 700x20c You can avoid pinch flat snake bites by inflating the tire to certain pressure If the tire picks up a broken staple it gets flat but you can patch it When the tube comes apart you cant do anything specially if the spare you happen to have has the same defect Ill never buy it and I dont recommend this to anybody 
So far so good with my first trial of these tubes Ive only gone a couple hundred miles on them but I can say with certainty that the smooth valve stem is an absolute must I tried them because of that after 3 flats in a row on Bontrager super lights all failing at the valve stem area I recommend based on performance so far No flat and they hold air well I run at 110 to 120 psi 
Great tubes Ive been through a few and they hold up fine under normal wear and tear Bought more 
Good tube but note that the valve stem is smooth  some pumps like my Joe Blow do not like this and the attachment slips off before I reach 115 psi I will have to order more carefully 
Simply the best tube Never a valve stem blow out failure unlike other brands 

the best butyl tuve the service very fast 
Michelin tubes have never let me down in terms of quality Ive purchased expensive tubes that have of all things failed at the valve junction where it meets the tube this is has never happened using Michelin tubes excellent price and relatively affordable 
Id like them a lot more if theyd said on the site that the values are fixed I brought these for some Zipp 60s and wont work as I cant add a valve extender 
Good tube What I use in my deep dish wheels because Michelin AirStops arent made in longer lengths 
Flat within a month I only ride 3 miles a day on flat roads only This is an absolute waste of money 
Theyre light but thats about it 
As advertised Will review further after use 
The condition is very good stuff 
The Michelin 700c 52mm Presta Valve Inner Tube is a good tire light holds air well no flats yet knock on wood 
These are nice light tubes and theyve held up well so far My only complaint is that they seem to lose air at a fairly quick rate I have to check my tire pressure before every ride even if its only been a day or two since the last ride This may just be a function of the thinner rubber for the ultralight tube but its still annoying 
these are my favorite tubes I prefer a threadless stem so that my pump head doesnt get chewed up and go for the longer ones to fit my 40mm aero wheels Other than that theyre as reliable as any tube and perhaps a little lighter I dunno Its a tube theres only so excited someone can get about a tube 
Even though these are ultralight tubes there have been no problems with flats They do loose some airmaybe 2 PSI overnight but as I always check tire pressure before leaving and generally dont ride for more than 45 hours at a time thats not a problem I prefer the 52mm valve length and can seldom find them at retail without threads aka French valves so its nice to find them here 
After running threaded presta valves and basically ripping apart the pump head I discovered these smooth barrelled presta valves and they are the only tube Ill run now 
I have a Road Race cycle self built These inner tubes last much longer compared to the standard Michelin inner tubes 
I purchased this tube as a spare for rides After replacing a flat loading the CO2 cartridge to proper pressure and setting off this tube burst within a mile Needless to say Im buying my tubes from local bike shops now 
This is lantern is easy to use easy to maintain and throws plenty of light with respectable run time Nosier and not quite as bright as a white gas lantern but the convenience and durability more than make up for it If you take pride in good gear this lantern wont let you down I would also like to recommend buying an outdoor grill that uses the same propane tanks as this lantern They cost about 399 in CA Great combo Keep the wind in your face and happy hunting 
I purchased this product mostly due to the carry case I wanted something that would store the lantern well and protect both the glass and mantles from breaking due to being thrown in the back of the truck with a bunch of other stuff that could end up on top of it or bump against it while we were driving 
This lantern works great will light up a big area of your camp site would not use it in a tent it gets to hot 
Love the box love the easy to use lantern Its great Id always had the knock off brand of lanterns that you had to put back into that flimsy cardboard box and hope that it didnt break This box is a great thing You get what you pay for when it comes to lanterns 
I previously had one with an ignitor and expected this would have one too I was dissappointed to realize I needed matches or a lighter to get this one going but its not a big deal Afterall it is camping and having an ignitor is for amateurs The case keeps it dry and protectedgreat for storage The lantern itself works great and the light is bright Be sure to push the handle down when the lantern is sitting as it will heat up fast if left up Also use in ventilated tents as it warns of exhaust although I didnt notice an odor or exhaust from propane I believe the one with the ignitor might be a little more  It was pretty convenient so Id look for that one if I was going to buy another 
I really like this chair The frame seems solid so far yet the chair is pretty light to carry The seat is comfortable and is very wide  much wider than most portable chairs The side table is a great addition although I do wish it were made of a more weatherproof material  the table will want to be protected from the rain 
I ordered two of these chairs from Amazon last week and they arrived two days ago My wife and I took them fishing last night We carried them down a steep hillside something I would not have tried with a heavier chair We caught three large Trout and the entire day I felt like I was sitting in my living room These chairs are very solid This was a good buy 
This chair is comfortable and kind of large The table is sturdy and has a cansized beverage holder The frame is rust proof aluminum which is a plus The only downside is the covering for the arms keep slipping off the foam pads underneath Im going to try some waterproof adhesive on those Other than that this chair is great Its very light so it easily straps to whatever load youre hauling to the campsite 
This is your standard middleoftheroad propane lantern Two mantles adjustable output plastic case plastic base with feet It is nothing spectacular but I give it 5 stars because it does exactly what it is supposed to do with no problems It is as bright as you will ever need One propane canister lasts around 8 hours Mantles last forever if you dont disturb them The case is a must Anyone who has owned a propane lantern without a case is familiar with having to buy replacement globes all the time The mantles can be lit by basically anything with a flame A cigarette lighter does the job fine as does a wad of lit pine needles or a twisted paper towel or a match or whatever Lighting it is no problem whatsoever The hiss is typical The construction is tough 
I purchased this lantern at a local chain retailer about a year ago for our first father and son camp out It worked perfectly then just as it does a year later It produces enough light to illuminate a large campsite but can be turned down to a low glow if desired The case is a nice touch an protects the lantern in transit Ive used it both on the small canisters of fuel from Coleman and on top of one of their propane distribution trees with good success We wouldnt go camping without it 
My wife wanted one of these for camping and as an avid camper I couldnt figure out why We have several camping chairs most of which are MUCH more comfortable than this one but this has one HUGE benefit the tablecup holder Anyone who has used camp chairs before knows that the cup holder on a folding chair tends to be only useful for water bottles and beverages in cansshort bottles Even then they only offer limited stability This chair while not the most comfortable out there has a rigid table surface which is great for setting drinks and food on One thing to note It folds FLAT  it does not collapse vertically like most camp chairs do so take that into consideration as well 
I purchased 2 chairs primarily for use by my husband and me at the back of our tent during craft shows we sell handmade gourd art and woven baskets The chairs are handsome comfortable convenient and very sturdy I was able to place some tools on the side table and work on my craft during the quiet times I highly recommend these chairs for anyone who wants a comfortable chair that has the convenience of a side table with cup hold which incidently has a slot for a coffee cup with a handle 
We needed to replace some camping gear for next summer Amazon had good prices what we needed and they arrived faster than expected Its a lot easier than going from store to store 
Pros Easy to light with long match mantles stay functional for a good while can be BRIIIIIGHT or nice  dim if you just need a small light but dont want to burn a lot of propane We ran our lantern for probably 9 hours over two nights using varied brightnesses dim for most of the time to BRIGHT for about an hour and a half and I still have about half a can of propane With the carrying case it is a heck of a deal 
Picked this one up after that last camping trip where I found I had plenty of propane but all my lanterns run on batteries that were all dead Decided that this was what I need to solve that problem but the store didnt have the auto ignite model in stock Plenty bright and easy to use but I worry that I might break a mantle lighting with matches The only reason for the four stars is because in my opinion you should opt for the same lantern with auto ignite Dont get me wrong this is still a great lamp 
Theyre tennis balls Vacuumed sealed Bought for my dog because ALL doggie tennis balls sold in pretty shops are too rubberized halves heels together by felt Needed real tennis balls so they would last longer Does the trick 
With these balls you are paying a premium for the US Open name I would rate these above average for comparably priced balls but they seem to lose their bounce fairly quick 
This bag is great for my boys Comfortable and warm Just all around good durable bag 
I dont play tennis These are for our 3 dogs to chase They live them and are tough and hardy 
Very good 
If you have a 2 or 3 burner Coleman Propane Stove this is the Griddle to buy It has legs that fit the diameter of the burner grates I mean it will not move once its placed on the grates and its not made of that cheap thin aluminum Its made of Cast Aluminum which cooks your food evenly Also this grill has a fantastic grease reservoir If the griddle doesnt say cast aluminum then youre wasting your money Or you can purchase a cast iron griddle which cooks well and evenly also but they are heavy and dont have the legs that fit into the stove burner grates The one below is an example of what not to buy  
My son found it to be roomy cozy and warm I thought it was a great value 
I cant give a firsthand report on this bag since I gave it as a gift I havent heard how well it works It did arrive as expected 
Purchased for my daughter9 and she loves it Perfect size and weight easy to roll and stow very warm and comfortable lining Perfect for short trips and light campingovernights Its the perfect upgrade from the Disney Character sleeping bags without spending a fortune Not tested outdoors yet but find me someone who wants to during a Michigan winter Great value A word of cautionthe color is much more blue than the photo represents Otherwise for the  it is perfect 
We bought 4 of these bags  one for each of the family Myself the wife and a 5 and 4 year old These sleeping bags are excelent value for the price Perhaps not suitable for a more gonzo backpacker  or technical trekking but fine for most family uses The cloth interior is quite comfortable and each bag comes with a convenient packing sleeve 
everything is good 
Yep The dog loves them Those pet store balls are too hard and dont get a good bounce on them Gotta have the real thing Tennis Really People use these for a game Who knew  
as expected 
Good quality Shipped on time 
I bought this for use with an older model 3 burner Coleman propane stove  and as others have said it fits perfectly Cooks very evenly and I highly recommend it 
Works great 
Although it says all Coleman 2 and 3 burner stoves it is NOT a great fit on the compact that I own Yes you can kind of jam it into place but it wont be stable and the windbreaks dont fit After looking at it for a while I decided to make some minor modifications I ground off about 18 of each outside foot tab on the griddle and it now fits down inside the frame of the stove as it should little too wide before I also used a nibbler to trim a notch into each windbreak panel so theyll fit around the corners of the griddle and tuck into their retention slots With those mods the griddle works like a charm and my first set of steaks came out great thumbsup from the wife and grandkids As other reviewers have noted the nonstick makes for easy clean up even better with grill spray before cooking After some experimentation I found that about 34 heat on my little stove is the best for meats This equates to about 10000 BTU 
Heavy duty and fits perfect on my coleman two burner stove 
We used this daily on our camping trip in the fall and it worked perfectly 
Love it 
Good price nice item Seem to be holding up well for casual rec play which is all I do Would hold up better if the dog werent helping 
When tent camping alone this little fan works wonders It doesnt crank out a lot of air but it does get things flowing pretty good considering how small it is It beats lugging around a portable standup fan and having to fight with it all night This fan stays tucked neatly out of the way on the dome of my tent I wouldnt suggest using it if you have more than one person in your tent with you especially if you AND your guest get hot fairly easily If you are alone however this little fan can keep you relatively comfortable all night Its a campers dream for a little relief but it isnt much help if youre camping in an area that stays rather hot in the evening 
They hold up so well for tennis or throwing to the dogs 
Not a lot to rate on tennis balls but these have the US Open logo and they look good 
I love it 
Bought to use in dryer with down jacket Worked great for that Can no attest to tennis playing 
Obviously you wil need to level your stove to use the grease trap function Or to fry eggs The nonstick surface is extremely slippery If you accidentally turn off the flame while the griddle in on you have to take the griddle off If its hot or has food on it thats a hassle I see no reasonable way around this issue Just take note 
Sothis is the second one I have purchased The first one walked off after I brought it on a Cub Scout campout I turn the heat up just a little on my coleman 2 burner stove I cook the link sausage and then the pancakes If you turn the burner down as far as you can without putting it out It heats the griddle perfectly and you wont burn the pancakes I have never used any pam or olive oil and nothing sticks to it After I let it sit for about 1520 minutes I then wipe it down with a wet wipe and it is ready to go next time Definitely worth the money I do wish it had a carrying case though 
Looks like am going to like it Love the way you can stick it to the side of the tent 
Of all the Coleman tent fans this one is the best It ran all night and it was very quiet It pushed a nice gentle breeze Unlike the other Coleman tent fans it actually worked on the second day of ownership I may order more of these 
I bought this fan to keep me cool in my tent It sucked The fan is liken to those personal fans that you can buy at the Dollar Store 
I like the idea of it magnetizing so that it can go anywhere Its difficult to get this to stay upright without it sagging from the wall of the tent though THe battery case is damn heavy The case also cracked right away making it difficult to keep the batteries in Sadly I think coleman is no longer the name it used to be 
I bought this fan and it broke trying to get the battery cover off I was going to return it and accidentally hit send replacement I let Amazon send me a replacement and I got it in 2 days The new one works perfectly Good job Amazon Im a satisfied customer 
Muck smaller than expected The fan works great and powerful with one D battery 
Not easily attachabletoo heavy 
5 stars Absolute piece of garbage please dont waste your money Too heavy with batteries considering there are 4 D cells this underdelivers any significant air movement Cheaply made plastic housing broke in less than 24hrs VERY DISAPPOINTING and Coleman should be ashamed to put their name on it 
Tough to use Impossible to position and hardly moves air Expected better from Coleman 

The fan doesnt push alot of air Its not badly designed particularly but I dont think it will make a difference on tent airflow 
I like this new addition to my camping gear I sleep alone in a twoperson tent so I focussed the breeze on me alone Its great for that It was probably 85 degrees at night when I tried it It was just enough air flow to keep me cool enough to sleep It used a D battery which is a bit heavy but an Energizer brand battery lasted for three nights and kept me cool and the inside of the tent dry This fan should be considered a personal device and not for a big tent Unless you can place it four feet or under from you dont buy BTWit has strong magnets and a metal plate that goes on the outside of your tent so you can put the inside fan part anywhere you want I had no problem with mechanical issues 
I had one of these for years and finally broke it You have to get inventive to mount it I would never attach it directly to a tents outer materialflysheet 
Happy 
I have a very small trail tent The fan was only three feet above my face and I could barely feel the breeze of the fan It did help with air circulation slightly but not enough for the trouble or money It broke after maybe half a dozen camping trips or so 
Coleman products have been around since the early 1900s and was the name in camping when I was growing up One of the largest outdoor gear companies I have bought and used Coleman gear for many years I was able to use this set several times during a one month stretch this summer and I have to say I am impressed with the set The quality is good and the pouch makes it always easy to locate for meals Although slightly thinner than a home flatware set they are likewise lighter I recommend this set with confidence 
I love camping accessories that save space and time This set does both The quality and portability are really great You can even fit a few extra things in here They did a good job making necessary tweaks to conventional form of spoons and forks in order to get them to roll into the carry case  the forks and spoons are a little flatter at the business end and straighter from the handle to the tip than regular utensils  but this is only so much as is necessary for compactness I bought this set based on reviews  including a video review The video highlighted one drawback that I agreed with  the Velcro fastener on the soft carrycase prevented rolling the set up as tight and compact as was possible It looks like theyve addressed that by adding tiestraps Allinall this is a durable compact and lightweight set good for any style of camping 
Since I overland in a popup truck camper I need everything I bring to be as compact as possible Space is very limited This set was a perfect match for my needs I dont have to worry about the silverware rolling around in a drawer and the case will keep them clean compact and organized The quality is sufficient and certainly a bargain for the price 
For roughly the same price maybe a dollar or two more you can get the Coleman Max Flatware Set instead It has a flap to cover the utensils from falling out the utensils are better made and the case is held closed by velcro instead of the strap I had these first and then returned them when I found the Max Just a much better product 
Coleman means camping but this flatware set is made in China They look nice but have rough edges but are stainless steel The bad part is Meijer sells these sets for 999 regular price The handles are black hard plastic and easy to hold and the forks spoons and knives are full sized and not the dinky ones campers seem to always buy 
Do know that this flatware may not be red once delivered mine was black If that matters to you at all but mine was to match my blue enamel dining set while camping and I am a Glamper so it matters to me I design camping photos for publication The flatware goes back Update June 15 2012 The Seller through Amazon said they will not pay for the return of the black flatware because its Amazons fault it is pictured red So not only did GoCampingCheap charge me 800 to ship it to me but they also made me pay 813 to send it back The flatware only cost 1299 I paid 1600 in shipping charges total on a 1300 purchased Do not purchase from Standard Camping Supplies or GoCampingCheap same companyor you will regret it if the product is delivered wrong or if you dont like the product accordinng to them 
My husband laughed when I bought this fan for our tent But when we laid down at night with this little guy running he changed his mind Now granted this isnt like having a big box fan or oscillating fan blowing air right on you and I didnt expect that But it is like having a gentle breeze blowing through your tent all night We had to sleep with the rain fly on since there were rain showers all night and this fan kept it from feeling like we were suffocating It was just enough to move air around and make it comfortable And it is really quiet so we didnt hear it at all 
Works great in tents for dogs that suffer from gas problems but it eats up batteries like a hog 
The back battery will break on you sooner than later I was trying to put a battery in for the first time and it started cracking Although it can still be useful and worth it There arent alot of options other than this anyway for the size and price 
I have taken this on three camping trips so far and I like it a lot Its important to attach it near a tent support because the batteries make it rather heavy It works well and makes my tent much more comfortable in hot weather Not loud at all 
I have used this a few times camping on the Gulf Coast This fan is heavy and bulky but moves enough air in a tent to make a difference It will easily run overnite with a D cell 
This was just what I needed and very inexpensive This keeps all my lines on the boat very organized Recommend it 
This is good basic flatware for the great outdoors Its not flashy but it does the job and does it pretty well My set had no problem with gaps in construction As far as people complaining about the case I havent had any problems with pieces coming out during transport If you do its simple enough to simply roll the case tight and put a rubberband around it The best features are that this set is reuseable thus saving on litter and cheap thus saving on the wallet 
Coleman generally has decent camping gear but this was not as well made as expected There are gaps between the utensils and the handles which will allow bits of stuff to get in there and hard to clean They generally didnt have a great feel to them not being of high quality I am returning them They are decent but not great 
These are too heavy and one of them was really noisy for a tent The other one was quite silent so I suppose it was just a defective one 
I got this for my tent but it wasnt worth it I thought that it would be handy to have something that I could attach from the outside of the tent via the magnet but I I didnt like it I would not recommend 
We use these fans when camping or boating during hot weather and theyre great The D cell batteries make it a bit heavy but they run for three or more full nights before new batteries are needed The only issue with this fan is that the battery compartment connection is plastic and flimsy Because this connection is also what keeps the fan connected to the magnetic portion it can fall apart Weve had to secure it with electrical tape which requires a new application with each battery change 
Great for keeping the tow lines for our jet ski toys from getting tangled Bright colors make them more difficult to lose 
Cool wrapsused all of them No problems currently Just will need to see how long the velcro lasts 
this fan definitely moves around some air and the batteries last a good amount of time this fan definitely helped keep me cool in the tent i will be getting a couple more to make a nice breeze in the tent 
going to buy a better one went camping lakeside in June Temperatures in the 80s at night Fan didnt help much Was also difficult to hang from our tent ceiling Magnet comes out too easily 
Good items of this order really love this item next time i will re order for sure and i will promote to my friends 
Use these all over boat They keep everything in order 
These things come in SO handy for keeping ropes wires etc organized  tangle free Velcro closure makes storing things quick  easy 
Cannot have enough of these around 
Wrapped my ropes Work has a cock ring to 
super 
Handy items to have around 
Great to have 
Works great for smaller tents Nice for some circulation in a hot or muggy tent Wish it had variable speeds 
I bought this fan for a week of camping in the Ozarks I was absolutely thrilled to see the unit ran all night for the first two nights on a single battery As a precaution I changed the battery on the third night The unit was not working in the morning Assuming it was a bad battery I changed it It slowly began to run and just stopped I was unable to get the unit to run any longer than a couple of minutes at a time and then only by spinning the blades to get it started I gave up after the fourth night and eight batteries later We disassembled the unit and bypassed the switch Still nothing By squeezing the motor we got it running well Clearly the motor wasnt up to the task as the brushes were most likely gone This was unfortunate as the unit provided a decent flow of air and was quiet enough to sleep with However the tiny motor is not good quality Also it costs just enough to be frustrating but not enough to go through the frustration of returning 
This is a good light that puts out a nice amount of light and doesnt kill batteries too fast because of the flourescent light Good for blackouts and a nice handle 
Love these to keep ropes and extension cords together 
ok product used on my boat and if exposed to sun to long like some boats are they dry rot faster that expected Thank you 
GREAT 
These are great and easy to keep ropes tied up tight We use them for our ropes on the boat and they work great 
I bought the Coleman Tent Fan for a recent camping trip The fan runs on a single Dcell battery and is pretty simple one onoff switch and a flexible rubber fan blade The magnetic mounting plate is a nice and simple solution the plate goes on the outside of the tent wherever you choose to locate it and the fan goes on the inside with the magnets holding it securely in place You have to literally twist the metal plate to remove the fan from its position so it wont easily fall at random The fan output isnt as much as I had hoped for In a 3person tent the Coleman Tent Fan will provide a nice breeze Its strong enough to circulate the air in and around your tent but not strong enough to say blow your hair back in the wind My only other complaint is that the price is a little high for a molded plastic fan Its useful but if you want a fan that will cool you down in hotter temperatures try something larger than this 
OKso this is not some high velocity fan but for the size price and convenience it is great I have used two of these on opposite sides of the tent and they work very nicely You cant expect huge air volume what you can expect is a reasonable breeze and you definately get that Actually the slight hum from the whril of the soft fan blades helps me get to sleep Getting the battery in is a bit difficult and the instructions are not very clear You really need to pay attention to the side tabs and make sure you know which is part of the housing and which is the part that will open up I also am a bit worried about the magnetit is a bit offcenter and may not be affixed well However it has held up so far It is very nice to have an item that actually works uses only a single battery and is not bulky or heavy 
Still have to try this out in the tent this weekend It was a trick getting the D cell battery in this thing but after pulling tugging cussing and busting out a butter knife I finally got it open I slapped the battery in and fired it up She moves some air This can be mounted on a wall with screws attached to a metal surface placed on a metal tent pole or sandwiched between the tent material with the metal base I live in Florida so hopefully this will keep me cool on those hot summer days Hahahaharight It only has one speed and is a little heavy for those wanting a light load 
Great for family camping where you can afford the weight from carrying batteries The output from this fan is adequate for one person so if you have kids plan on one for each of them The down side to that is these units do have enough weight that they can present issues when you use more than one per wall Overall a good product 
I sleep like a baby in it I have back problems and toss and turn in bed In my hammock my back pain just goes away 
Thank you 
Love this product 
Given as a gift 
I find many good uses for these velcro straps organizing rope and cords anchor points inside car for dog leash holding attachments to field bags and more This is a great little product that seems to create new uses the more I use it I recommend having some around theyll show you their value The construction quality is good I really like this simple product 
These are good quality and work well to hold ropes together The only negative is that the velcro does not extend far enough to allow closure around a relatively small circumference 
I have been looking for something like this for years I was worried that they wouldnt secure a small diameter item such as one 25 extension cord but it works great for anything from that small up to a 50 air hose and larger I will be ordering more of these to have on hand Very handy 
I originally bought these to keep the ropes on my boat straightened out I have found so many other uses in the garage and house that Im going to buy more They keep your ropes extension cords lights and hoses all in order You cant have too many of these around 
these straps work well for the price you are paying for them Would be nicer if they were wider and had stronger velcro 
I guess there are people who want to have a fan when they go camping I am not one of them However I am bald and hate that sweaty time after a workout when you just cant seem to cool down With no hair to wick out the sweat it can take some time to look like you didnt just get out of the shower Most locker rooms dont have enough fans either This thing is perfect I keep it in my little locker and pop it out and point it at my head when cooling down The magnet is plenty strong In fact set it on the gratey part of the locker to get if off easier Since I only use the fan for about 15 minutes each time I figure the one fat D battery will last months 
I bought 3 of these fans and in all cases the magnet had unstuck from the fan body rendering them useless on the campsite which was when I opened them for the first time only a visual inspection was done prior Luckily I had some tape to hold them together and was able to improvise The fan worked well and there was no complaints operationally I strongly recommend that you physically check the item and check it before reaching the campsite 
I bought one of these lastsecond for a camping trip It works pretty well Theres just one fan speed the button is good it moves a good amount of air but you cant get too far from it and its relatively quiet The magnet on the bottom is MASSIVELY powerful for such a small lightweight fan I guess Coleman was worried a weaker magnet would cause this unit to fall off of things too easily The metal plate is great for securing the fan to a tent wall and the magnet redily locks onto metal tent poles or whatever Ive used it for probably 150 hours now and have only gone through 2 batteries so its pretty energy efficient My only complaint is that the material the main housing is made out of isnt as durable as it should be especially with that big magnet working on it There are two notches in the plastic base that the batterydoor which also holds the magnet uses to close One clip is broken on mine because the magnet held while the unit came away when I went to pull it off a tent pole Thats why only 3 stars If Coleman made this out of more durable plastic or built a more durable closing mechanism it would be better But hey its cheap for what it is Still worth what I paid for it 
I bought 2 of these fans about 5 years ago At first we only used them at night I was AMAZED that I could run it all night it is COMPLETELY SILENT on a 4 night trip and it was still going strong Ive since bought 2 more as gifts Sometimes I attach them to the canopy over our picnic table or just carry them We use these fans on every trip and I never worry about them falling or breaking or running out of juice I dont know what others are doing with their fans to have such poor performance I keep mine in a coffee can between trips in a hot attic wo battery of course and they work time and and time again with no problems I just pull off the propellers and put the pieces in the can Simple With the magnetic grip you can attach it right to the gear loft and enjoy a great breeze just like having a ceiling fan I love them By the way you might think open blades are a safety issue but they are very gentle and stop the instant they encounter an obstruction Ive stuck my fingers in them many times as have my children and they have been totally harmless The blade stops instantly and it doesnt hurt one bit Its kind of a good party joke The magnet is super strong and holds tight I wish I had these when my kids were in strollers 
I almost didnt buy this fan after reading some of the bad reviews on Amazon but I needed a fan and needed it fast so I thought what the heck Many of the bad reviews point out that the fan is not strong or doesnt blow a lot of wind Well yeah but It runs on 2 D cell batteries and runs for quite a whole on those batteries which is good I found if you wanted air for just one person this fan was excellent at doing that So if youve got 3 or 4 people in your tent you will need 3 or 4 fans and position them over each person The magnet attachment feature works very nicely and holds securely and is also easy to take off when youre done and tearing down camp The small footprint of the thing is nice too Its not too heavy and doesnt take up much space So overall read the reviews on Amazon but realize that for the price and size of this thing it works well and does its job just dont expect huge industrial fan type performance 
This is a review as well as some suggestions for the other reviewers 1 The rainfly does cover the windows if you align it  center it correctly 2 It has excellent vetntilation The cealing does not have a closeable nylon covers inside the tent This is because it is a 3 season tent If you were able to close it to keep dust out you would find that the tent would be wet from condensation inside on the inside So the cealing is mesh to let warm air and moisture excape The rainfly keeps moisture out If the cealing had zipper covering over the meshit would be a 4 season tent useable in winter The tent sets up easy and served us well in our first weekend camoing in it We did not get any real rain so I cant comment on its waterproof effectiveness But it is gaurenteed waterproof I love the headroom and the zippers opperated smoothly without a snag Im happy with it Hope this is helpful 5132008 I used this tent 6 times this year already One night it rained very hard The tent was amazing as not one drop on either of us throught the entire storm I honestly thought that we were going to get wet This tent does what it says Update 2009 Ok it is now 2009 the rainfly ripped last year but Coleman sent me a new replacement at no charge Suggestion you dont need to tighten the 2 side rain fly cords so tight just enough so they are away from the tent You should however tighten the 4 corner rain fly cords snug this help keep the rainflt and tent stable and keep pressure off the 2 side rain fly cords where rips occurred Follow this and you should not tear your rain fly It rained all weekend while camping this weekend 2 nights very hard and not a drop on us third season and the tent still has no issues I really like this tent I would confidently buy another Coleman tent Don 
Awesome quality great price 
No need for a bug net It makes a perfect cucoon Best sleeping arangement ive used Eady to clean no iffy seams and same fabric as more expensive hammocks 
Roomy and comfortable holds up well 
I read the reviews and had concerns but it was the only fan that I could get in time for a campout Overall the fan works It was really hot and this fan circulated the air in my 4man tent While I wasnt in danger of being blown out of the tent it did push the air around and provide a gentle breeze There is very little chance of the fan falling because the magnet that connects the back plate which goes on the outside of the tent and the rest of the fan is strongreally strong So strong that when I pulled the fan off the back plate the back batter cover which the magnet is attached stayed stuck to the back plate The next time I removed the fan I thought I knew better and held on the sides where the battery cover locks on to the fan This time the glue that holds the magnet on the battery cover pulled a part leaving the magnet still attached to the back plate Time to break out the liquid nails glue Ill keep the fan it works but Coleman should redesign the fan The tabs that hold the battery cover to the rest of the fan is really thin and I can see it breaking easily with the magnet that strong 
I use it all the time during summer camping when it is hot  humid at night 
This fan was terrific In fact my camping pals were so impressed and kept borrowing it so I am ordering more as gifts 
I have two of them here in the house just in case the power goes out at night Battery operated and gives plenty of light without having to mess with fuels 
The Colman 4D is great for lots of uses but especially when the power goes out Great lighting Recommend 
Good backup light source for emergencies 
This is a great summer tent You can stand up in side with no problem But I never have gone through a rain storm or high winds 
As well made as a Kelty I once ownedmaybe better Highly recommended for 34 people though Im using it with just one and a couple of large airmatressesroom to spare 
Took on two camping trips It was used by EVERYONE So comfortable After a rain storm dried out quickly Whether you buy the actual extenders or make your own you will want to be prepared for the fact that you wont have trees at a perfect distance and will need a way to secure to a tree 
Used hammock 3 times now on camping trips Best quality of hammock is its small transport design I saw similar hammock at WalMart it did not have the same weight limit 
I bought this item for a teenaged Boy Scout He has only used it on one camping trip so far but its a great gadget and he enjoyed it It packs up small and has the potential to make your camper the envy of the troopfamilycampsite Fun 
coleman used to be very good this screen ripped within five minutes of using it very very cheap i was dissapointed poorly seemed together 
I used this tent in 7 and there was snow on the ground Tent goes together in about 5 minutes and is very easy to take down Best tent Ive owned 
Family of 4 I dont remember when we bought it For fairly inexpensive its a great tent Lots of room The divider is inconsequential Difficult for one person to set up because of its size but not impossible Two makes it easy Easily beat the canvas tent it replaced I think its well built Not long after buying it set it up at relatives house on a hill For four days there were storms with high winds at night It was scary Stood up to the winds and driving rain Couple of drips but stayed dry Good ventilation As with any tent you should seal the seams before use Am considering an inexpensive 5x7 Sundome Durango for car camping 
Small size but OK for Earthquake kit 
It feels slow speed but its much better than nothing What I saw is what I got Nice buy 
This is a rather adequate small portable fan that will put out some air circulation It is rather liteweight until you put in the monster sized D cell batteries The weight gain is considerable The battery power does not last long either approximately three 3 hours if you are lucky when using this in nonstop mode Have to agree with one of the other reviewers that when you insert the batteries the fan does tend to bulge out and then you have to wrestle with it trying to put the cap back on I too broke the tabs on mine but that was fixed with duct tape If attaching this item to your tent ceiling using the provided magnet it will make the ceiling sag quite a bit especially after inserting the batteries Recommend using this item in a tent where you have some head room and not worry about banging your head on it The fan blade is made of plastic so theoretically you should not have to worry about getting cut Overall an alrite item 
My family and I bought this fan before a camping trip to South Carolina in July I was really looking forward to a cool breeze in our tent Much to my dismay this puny fan did not provide ANY breeze Holding it in your hand 6 inches away from your face it is a mediocre personal fan It might work for oneperson tents but for families or hot climates this isnt worth its weight 
Perfect size lamp for camping 
Works great  Awesome light Durable 
Very good 
Nice Lamp for Various Uses where Light is Required for Usage 
As expected  works great 
Works great in tents for dogs that suffer from gas problems but it eats up batteries like a hog 
I absolutely love this fan Considering its size and that its a battery operated fan ie not an AC fan the output it provides can definitely cool one person down while heshe is lying down inside a tent We stored our first fan with its blades attached to it The weight of the batteries contributed to the breakage of the blades Because I like to carry light for camping I had to buy another one due to its cant be beat output for a small battery operated fan Because we now store the fan with its blades detached from its base the blades held together the past three camping trips This year were going camping with our toddler who still takes naps This fan will definitely cool her down during her nap 
I bought one of these to test it out first  now have gotten 3 more I use these in our food vending tent for when we are at places with no elec They do a good job of lighting up the area while we work We hang them from the handle Im sure if you had a table to place them on they would put out a nice range of light for you 
enough light for a small to medium room solid built not easily tilted good for garage camping or fishing at least 2 per home for emergencies 
Works like a Coleman What a good company I seldom need a lantern but it is good to know I have a good one on hand 
Perfect for camping especially if youre a clutz or a kid No propane to worry about and if I knock it over I have no biggie Its like the energizer bunny Oh yea get that for the 4D size batteries youll need Worth every penny mm dollar I paid Did I mention it gives off a decent amount of light It does I camp a lot 
We use it when camping Very portable and gives out excellent light Batteries also last long We have used it several times and like it 
Battery life on this has been pretty good so far had it a couple years and still using the original batteries It is not an overpowering light but it will let you see what you are doing in the near vacinity 
Ive borrowed a lantern for several camping trips so I decided it was time to get my own I borrowed an older Coleman from my aunt as well as an offbrand lantern from my brother in law Both had hooks that recessed into the handle for hanging the lantern into the top of your tent I have a 3 year old Coleman tentit has a loop in the top specifically to be able to do this After I saw this lantern didnt have a hook I looked at other Coleman lanterns and they dont have them either What the heck Coleman When I needed handsfree use I wound up securing it in the flap holder above the tent window but this didnt feel very secure Bring back my hook 
You might be wondering why someone who isnt a camper would need a lantern well I bought it because we had a big power outage and it was awful Although we had lots of candles I think having this lantern is a much better choice as it throws more light and is safer around out pets with wagging tails I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend it highly 
This lantern is small but easy to carry around and the light is good for a small area to be illuminaated Will probably purchase another 
Ordered this for a camping trip Got it put in batteries turned it on to check it and it seemed fine I put it away for a few weeks pulled it out turned it on and nothing Changed the batteries just in case nothing Of course I threw away all the original packing so I doubt they will let me return this piece of junk And I bought Coleman because they are suppose to have a good reputation Apparently not 
i would hardly call this a personal size Its more of a family size used this for bike camping way too big Would prefer something much smaller this would be better for car camping 
Bought 2 of these just in case Appears they will do the job I dont require much just something to light the way rather than just using flashlights However its rare that we lose electricity 
Ive had a Coleman Personal Lantern for about ten years now Its very similar to this model except that the glass is shaped slightly differently the glass in mine is not curved in an upanddown way its a curved cylinder Ive used it almost entirely for camping and it has been stored for long periods of time Its been a quite good lantern but Im now thinking of replacing it My lantern uses fluorescent lighting and 6 Dcell batteries I have nothing against that except that I think the more modern LED lighting would be better light and more battery efficient In any case Coleman makes a good lantern and I wouldnt hesitate to buy another of this brand Gary Peterson 
Great helmet fits to size comfortable in the water Have ordered this helmet again for a gift Its great for anyone wanting to be safe during water rec 
I use this for Wake boarding and it takes a beating It handles the water well and protects your brain case very well I try crazy stuff and these Helmet does its job well 
PROS Good materials and finishing light strap nicely adjustable CONS Helmet sizing charts see Protech web site are a little off Using their charts i determined my son my wife and I could all wear larges After receiving the helmets I ended up having to get a medium for my son and an XL for myself Part of the reason is simply that the helmet shells are misformed for the average head It is too short from front to back so it creates pressure on your forhead and back of head Uncomfortable to say the least I have helmets from Giro Trek and Specialized and they all fit great so its not our heads Im going to try and heat one up to see if I can reshape it a bit otherwise I need to sell these on Ebay and get something that isnt deformed 
We purchased two for emergencies We just had Hurricanes twice here in MD in 2011 and 2012 In 2012 our electricity was our for 18 hours We tried surviving by candles and our birds had no light or warmth We purchased two of these one for my husband and I and one for the bird room Its better than sitting around with candles and walking around with flashlights Hopefully we wont have any problems Its great to have these for emergencies And now the birds will have light in their room and warmth 
Surprises a decent amount of light however I purchased 4 lanterns after the recent hurricane learned my lesson a decent size and easily stored plus the amount of light it provides is decent for a small room I found Rayovac to have better lights for similar prices 
One of the best camp stoves Ive owned The price has gone up quiet a bit since purchasing the first one I have used this on a boundry waters trip for a week The fuel lasted several days before filling it back up Its heavy so not recommended for backpackers but it can be done This new purchase will be for car camping only This item does not have a built in ignition so you will need a lighter or fire steel 
Works Good 
Ive been using this stove for 4 continuous months running it exclusively on Regular Unlead Gasoline I buy the lowest grade unleaded gasoline that I can find usually from the local truck stop To ensure that the fuel is free of water or other contaminants I purchased a filter funnel on Amazon The Fuel Funnel is the Mr Funnel AF1CB Fuel Filter at the following link httpswwwamazoncomgpproductB000SOFLHKrefohauidetailpageo06s00ieUTF8psc1 After my purchase of the RUG Regular Unleaded Gas I use the funnel to pour some fuel from the Gas Can into a 2quart clear glass bottle Any water and contaminants stay in the funnel and only the gasoline with additives go into the bottle The water contaminants remaining in the funnel can be emptied into a pail for disposal The filtered gasoline captured in the 2quart container can be again filtered by using the Coleman filtering Funnel for adding fuel to the stove and the remainder poured into empty fuel bottles for later use So after using RUG for a few months Ive not experienced any problems with the additional filtering process The stove lights up fast and allows me to adjust the flame from furnace blast down to a fine simmer with no problems 
Great product 
Like the fact that this bulb can eventually be replaced if and when it burns out Bright enough to read by 
Great stove just needs a protective bag for inside the pack Should come with one 
Great little stove 
Stove is super simple to operate boils fast and makes having to carry a separate fuel canister unnecessary Its a little heavier than a dragonfly or other backcountry models but its sturdier heats faster and way less finicky 
good 
This is our 3rd or 4th Coleman single burner camp stove in nearly 40 years Our favorite no longer sold was the Peak 1 But this has worked well for the 15 or so times this season weve used it Per many other reviews it doesnt simmer well but it does a decent job reheating precookedfrozen soup and of course works great and quickly doing simple water boiling If youd be cooking from scratch with raw ingredients and making stuff thicker than soup its lack of good simmer or midlevel heat control may be a putoff But its been great for us Very reliable and easy to start and keep on 
I ordered this to get ready for outages Were holding our breath that we will not need it as Hurricane Sandy approaches We are way out in the country so it is pitch dark outside We have to go to our woodshed at night and our dogs are scared of the dark and wont walk far from the house when we let them out so we use it for those two reasons also It is a great lantern for the price Durable but know you are going to need lots and lots of D batteries  stock up 
We bought 2 of these for each of our daughters homes in the event of a power loss They are excellent and beat the heck out of lit candles everywhere My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is the size It is conserably smaller than the one we bought for ourselves a number of years ago 
I received this lantern in a timely manner It was as large as I thought it would be The light is like having a TV on in a room when it is dark Not bad but I may get another one so the darkness can be brighter Thanks 
If you camp and enjoy simplicity This is your stove Runs gasoline Camp fuel Kerosine I keep little Mae bottles of fuel Pump this sucker up and cook I have many stoves MSR Jetboil Snowpeak Etc this is the most used Stable and always fires Tough thing is you cant dial heat down Its kinda all or nothing You can pump it up high and turn it down but typically goes out Great stove though I also have the dual fuel lantern and double stove All used with the fuel I use in the jeep One fuel 
I used two opportunities and it does not work 
Super camper stove Burns so cleanly that you cannot see the flames in the sun but it boiled the kettle of water 25 times faster than a gas camper stove 
If it wasnt so expensive I would by more I purchased this for hunting even though last year I used a soda can with alcohol that cost me nothing As for this product  It can get smelly if u are not careful Im afraid I might make a mistake and burn myself but I used it a lot now and its awesome I feel more comfortable with it gas Its built like a tank  And it works every time really well Its stable and gets hot enough to use on a regular size frying pan 

Does what it is supposed to Keeps eggs from cracking and i closes well 
Best idea ever A plastic egg keeper for eggs Who wants to fill a cooler full of ice and throw a cardboard box of eggs in It gets soggy Well this works wonderfully Havent had a broken egg yet 
I very much enjoy this egg container for camping So far no mishaps I think it is a good design and not too heavy 
I used this for a camping trip out in the middle of the Keys and this thing worked great I didnt have any breakage of the Eggs on the way out in rough waters and in a little skiff I would buy if you dont want any breakage of eggs 
It does not protect eggs from external shock When the egg is broken it cant hold liquids This is just cheap plastic egg holder without any shock protection or sealing Typical eggs box is better than this one 
great item if you like to make eggs when you camp Very light weight and can store small stuff after all the eggs are gone strong and lightweight 
I didnt have any broken eggs but I dont quite thing I needed these I dont like how the cooler water is on the eggs and I found that putting a paper towel on the eggs before closing keep them from jiggling around I will continue to use this but Dont feel I am any better off with it 
This is a great light During recent power outages it was indispensable because it can be carried easily or set down to light a room or read 
This Coleman Personal size Lantern is great It provides a nice light it has both a Bright and also a Low setting Its about a foot tall counting the handle Its rugged and takes 4 D cell batteries I use high capacity rechargeable batteries and they last for a long long time This is great for camping but also great for power outages such as the one we just experienced hear in the North East I was able with three lanterns this one a competitors brand and a family size Coleman to keep much of our home lighted I can highly recommend this product for anyone 
One tough little stove Not much has changed over the years besides paint This stove is one of the most reliable available It runs on unleaded gas so it is very cheap to use and it will handle quite a bit of abuse There are lighter options available but buying special fuel gets expensive It boils water very fast and will cook a meal in no time I can only say one bad thing about this item and it has nothing to do with the stove itself Coleman no longer sells these with a carry case and that is a bummer Even if they charged a little more the case would be well worth it I recommend it 100 to anyone who is shopping around for a camping stove that will stand up to the test of time 
Larger than the average isobutane stove Not a light stove but useful for more than just boiling water It runs a lot longer and quieter too Good for camping over a few days 
Wouldnt hold a small 6 inch pot on level surface Returned 
It is not as easy to use as my butane stove but the savings in fuel costs make it worth the extra work My butane stove is going in the closet to be used as a backup This is a very reliable stove of course its made by Coleman 
Rather than doing my own review I am going to comment on a few others 1 Someone stated Only bad part is you will spend 300 than at WalMart As of right now this is accurate However as that poster also mentioned spend your money at Amazon not WalMart What is that 3 extra dollars REALLY worth to you besides the gas it costs you to drive to WalMart 2 Great if you have really small eggs I couldnt agree more We have our own chickens in the backyard rural and this crate is actually preferred because their eggs are smallerthis smaller container provides them with better protection than a bigger one where theyd have room to rollbounce around For those of you without chickens here is your solution Get chickens They are fun to watch for adults having a cocktail in the backyardthey are great entertainment for the kids and your dogs will ignore them and viceversa after the first few days with any minimal training Six of them cost us approximately 30year and we get 4 to 6 eggs a day every day for 30 days every month That equates to 10 cartons a month9 of which we generally give away and occasionally sell at the Farmers Market if we have too many Last year we paid for our annual cost with the first months eggs everyone we know had farmfresh eggs yearround for free and at 2carton it is 240year worth of eggs you dont have to buy With those savings you could buy 10 of these COntainers and give your first crop of backyard eggs to your friends in fancy containers that they can go camping with See how I did that 
This product worked great for our camping trip It kept every egg blemished for a 4 hour car ride in a full ice chest and three days of packing and unpacking My only complaint is the little catches the secure the closure are difficult to open 
In addition to camping we use this in our refrigerator for keeping eggs instead of just the carton in the carton if someone leaves eggs in the back and you grab the front to pull it out then the carton can sag and let the eggs loose  this is stiff plastic so no matter how one places the eggs in nothing sags 
This is one of our favorite things to take camping The eggs dont break and it is so handy I recommend it 
I guess it does hold 12 eggs I used this egg container on an offroading trip where I had 7 out of 12 eggs break I initially placed it in ice in my ice box and the terrain WAS pretty bumpy but I expected it to hold through that terrain 
I have both Coghlans and Colemans dozen egg container and after using both camping my opinion is that Coghlans is better Its because of little things but they stood out to me First the handle of the Coghlans is a little stiffer than Colemans so it doesnt bend as much before the container opens Second using extra large eggs I noticed that eggs rattled around more in the Coleman container than in the Coghlans And finally the Coghlans has one hinge running almost the entire width of the container while the Colemans has 4 narrow plastic straps for hinges These are little differences but my perception is that Coghlans lays flatter opens easier and provides better protection for the eggs 
Worked good on a raft on a 5 day We had 4 of these and put rubber bands around them and put them in the cooler and they survived Dropped one onto sand and all the eggs were fine 
It is what it is and it did a fine job protecting my eggs while I was out on a camping weekend 
Worked really great for cooking and boiling water as long as you dont put too much weight on it as everything has a limit The use of cheap unleaded fuel worked great Burns for hours on one tank only thing that I didnt like was when I burned the entire tank till empty there was a little fuel in the tank like maybe an ounce I would guess Shook it out and a little air dry wout the cap and back into storage Great flame control for simmer or max BTU 
Good 
very dependable and well priced 
Really GOOD quality Well built 
Great Product  
This lantern works perfect for a small group 35 of people to hang around Also works well on a standard sized picnic table If you have a larger group or several tables you will need more lighting I bought this mostly for camping also for emergency preparedness It is recommended you have several light sources flashlights and lanterns This is perfect size and output for an average living room With the bulb I feel like it is safer than the propane or gas lanterns Also the rated run time on this 4Dbattery version is better the the larger 8D version of this Mathwise if you only have 8 Size D batteries you will get more run time from this lantern then the larger version Have a look at the specs of this and the larger 8D battery version The 8D version also doesnt output that much more lumens they might be equal 
This is an extremely rugged lantern I have dropped it tons of times and it works very well It has gone through many rough camping trips but it has lasted The battery life has not changed either For the price you cant beat this deal I know for a fact because I shopped around quite a bit for any quality lantern similar to this in price which also used batteries No sporting goods or camping stores really had a cheaper price even when the product was on sale So I bought this lantern and I have not been disappointed one bit My only problem with it is that there is really not much of a difference between the high and low setting But that doesnt really matter It works well and emits enough light so I am happy 
I gave this product 5 stars as I believe it warrants them However I will state that this lantern would best be suited for easy camping and it is a personal size lantern It seems to be a durable lantern for normal campground type use but I would take something a bit more rugged into the woods It throws a fair amount of light and would illuminate a 23 person size tent 
I cant count how many eggs have been lost to the ravages of transport Cartons get wet and fall apart Styrofoam gets squished Tupperware gets knocked over Now its ok All sizes of eggs fit and no worries having it in a cooler It paid for itself in the lack of breakage we now have 
this is a convenient thing to have on hand it even holds jumbo size eggs i found the only reason i dont give it five stars is because it does seem a little flimsy i feel like coleman used to make these better the handle is pretty thin and the closure is kinda weird theres no clip latch to give me a confident close but i havent had any problems yet you cant really go wrong its just sitting in your cooler anyway as long as it keeps my eggs from breaking 
My friend has a small hobby farm with chickens and when we meet at work I give him the empty egg container and he gives me back 12 farm fresh eggs We havent broken an egg yet and I dont have to worry that a little moisture from my cooler will turn a dozen eggs into a stinky car disaster 
Works well for my camping but had to buy two because they dont sell an 18 count container Its like hotdogssix come in a pack but eight buns come in a package 
It was a little to big for jumbo eggs but I fixed that issue by putting a paper towel on top and then closing it Keeps the eggs from rattling around and breaking 
I have mine for over Ten Years It works as good today as it did the First day I used it A must have 
Awesome car and winter camping stove Brainout easy to use and can simmer rice something my backpacking stoves cant do well or turn it to volcano hot for melting snow Not the most stable platform for holding big pots but I just place a couple of strategic rocks around it if were putting the huge stew pot on it Cant go wrong with this stove 
PERFECT 
Defective does not work 
1 The hinged side broke off almost immediately 2 It was kind of irrelevant that the hinge broke off because my hens lay REAL sized eggs and this container doesnt fit REAL sized eggs I have a little bantam hen 12 size hen for those of you who dont know what bantams are and her eggs which are SMALL are the only ones that ever fit into this container Mine is green and not red Waste of money even if its only 6 
The egg cartons always get wet then the eggs are just floating around the cooler Not anymore This simple product makes camping so much better 
That is what I bought it for but I should have gotten the 6 container as 12 eggs is a loy mor than I thought it would be Great container I have dropped it full with no breaks 
The snap clasps to close it are very cheesy and apt to pop open For good measure I keep a strap around it to keep it shut It works well to protect the eggs when travelinghiking but you definitely cannot count on it to stay closed in your pack when left to its own design I do like that it can fit many sizes of eggs It has four fins on one end of each egg compartment which are flexible They will bend to create room for larger eggs and flex to hold smaller ones snugly 
This made packing eggs for breakfast so much less stressful When you are packing a weekend worth of food in a cooler full of ice the last thing you need to be dealing with is eggs in the grocery carton they came in I packed 8 eggs in here we fried 6 and then I boiled the last two for our ride home Cheap and efficient piece of camping equipment that will see years of use 
A classicworks everytime 
Heavier thank my old 442 but Im just using it for car camping these days not backpacking Flame would sputter for awhile after each lighting before becoming consistent Overall worked well and is a solid representative of what one expects from Coleman 
awesome product 
Just like any other Coleman product perfect as always 
I have owned mine for the past 18 years and it is the only stove I own I have the carrying case and I have done 27 mile backpack trips with it as our only stove Pros dual fuel good quality decent base for large potspans a tank of fuel lasts a while Cons Slightly bulkyheavy but nothing is perfect runs on pump gas but not as well takes a moment for the flame to be fully usable blue color Judgement I would fully recommend this stove and I have the dual fuel lantern as well 
Although this item feels a little bit cheap it gets the job done Guess I shouldnt expect much more for the price Great buy 
This was a good buy It lit up my 3 person tent well enough not super bright but I agree that the difference between the low setting and the high setting is hardly even noticeable It was nice to have in addition to flashlights for our tent and also to keep at our camping workstation at night Seems durable Itll be useful for any winter power outages in our home 
I love this lantern Was delivered undamaged looked just like the photo and surprise it works just as stated Im using it to see to write this review Lantern is 10 12 H with handle down about 5 12 W The lite area is 4 H x 4 12 W gives off great light for a small area running on 4 D batteries Would probably be great in a small 23 person pup tent will know later when I review tent purchase later Currently using in the house for emergency power outages Would recommend being careful not to touch plastic lens cover does seem to scratch very easily Not sure how lens will hold up under cleaning Even with batteries in it not too heavy to carry battery compartment easy to get to and easy to open close as bottom just screws onoff replacement bulbs carried at local walamrt in camping dept Handle of good quality for a plastic unit also has a rubber grip at top nice I also agree not much difference between high and low setting so I use on low to save batteries So far my only concern is the lens cover for light shouldnt scratch so easily could interfere with light brightness with frequant cleaning That is the only part that is not rugged on this lantern 
We bought this for our house for power outages and will be buying another one as well as the larger family one This is perfect for bedrooms or small rooms for power outagesmuch better than flashlights and candles I hadnt originally thought of a camping lantern for this purpose not sure why but in the face of an anticipated storm and power outage we saw this at the store and thought it was a good idea Turns out it was a great idea and works perfectly for this purpose And it will be great to take camping as wellsmall portable easy to store Bulbs can be replaced UPDATE i do like this lantern however i found one that i like even better it has a better light and seems much more durablenbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefGESteelBEAMClassicKryptonLanternGreendpB0025XZ6AYrefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTF8GE SteelBEAM Classic Krypton Lantern Greena

Well made and sturdy as expected from Coleman 
I like this product a lot its a classic compact well made easy to use The only criticism is I do find myself having to pump it to keep it running more than I like maybe I didnt have it filled up enough Recommend getting the Rubbermaid 6 quart storage container and lid as an easy way to store it and accessories 
good 
Made of good stell They clip together nicely and are very compact Would definately recommend to anyone needing camp silverware that once to stay compact and light 
Coleman has made an excellent qualityproduct All three utensils nest well and fit in small spaces without damaging anything surrounding them 
The plastic container that hosts the utensils package tore apart after one usage IMO the plastic container is important as the knife is quite sharp pointed 
I bought the Coleman Stainless Steel Nesting Utensil Set knifeForkSpoon set because it looked cool I go backpacking a lot and it is nice to have items that stick together Before when I went with indivial items I would have to dig in my bag to get them all out but this product keeps everything together It works great and is small and lightweight I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a campingbackpacking utensil set 
I needed this lantern for a backpacking trip with my kids the one we already have is too big I bought one for each of our tents the lantern worked out perfectly its lightweight enough to hang from the middle of the tent and plenty bright enough for a four man I noticed the difference in the brightness of the low setting and high setting but definitely if you dont need the high dont waste the batteries If there is a brighter small not too expensive lantern out there Id like to know I wish this was brighter but it was sufficient 
My old Coleman 502 was famous among users because it could low simmer This new version 533 burns hotter and it can also low simmer First Class Product Im glad i made this purchase Amazon Prime has the best price and delivery  
Gasngo straight out of the box I do miss my M1951 but this will do nicely 
This stove is perfect for those times when Im out by myself and dont want to bring along the big twoburner grill with propane tank Ive only used an 8 teflon frying pan to do my cooking on this burner so I dont know how well the larger and heavier iron skillets will work One thing thats certain is that you will need to place this burner on a flat and level surface before attempting to balance anything on top of it Also for maximum heating efficiency you will want to use one of those wind blocks 
great price and quality 
I was surprised at how sturdy these were These should do quite well for minimalist camping and hiking I can totally envision these performing very well if I ever decide to cook up a Porterhouse on the trail Realistically they will be used mostly for eating stews soups and MRE type meals They fit nicely together They do come with a plastic bag for storage but its just a cheapy plastic bag I mistook it for packaging at first Not a show stopper though The fork and knife are quite pointy and sharp I suppose if things south on the trail you can fashion the fork and knife into fancy fish and game spears 
This thing is marginal Either get a threepiece titanium set with a ringbiner or get a sporks I keep this threepiece set in with the familys camping stuff because it is certainly functional but there are better options for a serious outdoorsperson 
Extremely practical utensil I know of many of this kind but this is the BEST in addition to be a very well designed set and excellent for the purpose of replacing home silverware in camping every part pf it is so easy to take off and join together again It is worth more than what I paid for it 
This seems to be a durable utensil set whether for camping your lunch box or take to beach picnics Travels well interlocks together 
Too small too thin bruising your fingers Crap 
Im being generous giving it 3 stars I think its poorly designed I bought this egg container thinking it would keep uncooked eggs from rattling around in my cooler But I found that even using the largest eggs I could find in the store jumbo there was enough room in each compartment to allow the jumbo eggs to move and rattle around I did not toss the case around or hit lots of bumps on the road as I carried the cooler in my car to see if the uncooked eggs would break  sorry I just didnt feel like tempting fate and cleaning up the mess But Im not confident they would not break since there is so much movement of the eggs inside the case and since there are nibs the eggs bump against In other words the inside of the egg holder is not completely smooth on both sides See my photos above for close up of the inside Then I thought I can still use it to hold hard boiled eggs because I dont have to fear hard boiled eggs cracking and breaking and making a mess But thats not good for me because I want to peel the eggs before putting them in the case which is what I wanted to do so I could have easy to grab and eat hard boiled eggs as an easy snack while driving on a very long road trip With peeled eggs you have to deal with these nibs cutting up your hard boiled eggs As I mentioned above the top of half of the case has these annoying tiny nibs in it cant think of a better word to describe them see my photos for details and the nibs poke and pierce the peeled eggs which allows the introduction of bacteria into the eggs These annoying nibs appear to be there to hold the eggs in place but they dont peeled or not as I mentioned above even jumbo eggs in the shell rattle around loosely in the holder A better design would have been a thin plastic tongue instead of the nibs The plastic tongue could act like tiny spring board holding any egg in place The trick would be to make sure the pressure of the plastic spring would not break a raw egg But once that was done right you could put virtually any egg inside any size peeled or not the tiny smooth spring board would adjust to any size egg and it would not rattle crack or puncture the eggs And the casecontainer can NOT stand up on its own due to the tiny hinges It must lay flat The design has one possible pro the clasps are very basic and seem sturdy The best way to get the case open easily is to pry open the handles separating them from each other This is a good design if you want to make sure the case does not pop open easily on its own or by small children But for someone with a disability or arthritis opening the case would be difficult Bottom line I think overall this case was poorly designed and a waste of money Especially since I now have a plastic container Ill rarely if ever use that I may end up giving away or putting in the recycle bin There are other brands of egg holders but I wont buy another one by mail because the coast of returning is not worth the hassle Amazon is usually good about returns but only if an item is defective and I dont think defective design or poor design qualifies for free returns My loss Ill be more careful next time with items that need to fit properly These are the measurements see photos also Width  75 Length wo handle  575 Length with handle  675 Depth  325 
This is a great egg nest for taking whole hard boiled or raw eggs on the go if you take them camping I would suggest that you seal the eggs  container in a plastic bags first then put them in your cooler We used both the egg carton and the container  put both in a bag tho the carton did absorb the dampness and start to fall apart after the second night I would purchase a second container if I were to take two dozen eggs again  
I just returned from the deep woods and found that this pump was an absolute essential item to the trip It took me less than 2min to fully inflate a full sized mattress When coupled with the coleman 4D pump it took only 6min to fully inflate a king sized bed The two pumps together were a perfect combo If you are inflating more than one bed you can use the battery or car pump to get the beds to a certain point then use the manual pump to finish the job This pump comes with a variety of nozzles for every bed type in the coleman line so you wont have to worry about being without comfort or having to look for other accessories When it was time to deflate and pack up I found that by placing the hose on the other air point I could suck the air from the mattress easily and get it to the point where I could roll it back into the bag without hassle I would highly recommend this pump for all coleman air mattresses 
We have used this for camping blowing breakers in our bathroom power outages and lighting our way to our neighbors to visit Easy to recharge and we dont have to buy stinky white gas or propane cylinders 
Alright so here is the rubI love this little stove but its lack of a case made it difficult if not impossible to put it into a pack And lets all be honest If Im going car camping then Im going to want a bigger stove to cook my 14 tons of bacon on That being said after an exhaustive search and almost a full 30 minutes of googling I came across this little beauty of a pot that perfectly fits the stove it just needed a little padding to make it completely secure first I used my socks but my wife thought that was just gross so we ended up compromisingWhat I say when my ego wont let me say she got her way on empty trash bags and Ziplocs It not only protects the stove now but when I place my feet close to the fire they dont erupt in flames I highly recommend the GSI Outdoors Straight Pot with Lid Blue 35Quart 
Nice little stove 
Top product would recommend it to evry body 
If you ever think about bringing eggs with you do yourself a favor and get this Its not a 100 shock proof product but it will help with little bumps and it protects well against water too so it wont get all smooshy if it gets a little wet 
Car camping trip day 2 eggs in cooler moved around in bear locker taken out for a bitdropped and shattered Egg spills are a major hassle a light drop and they shatter instantaneously lose precious food resources big sticky mess NOTE a dozen egg egg holder turns to mush and loses all ability to protect precious contents when wet Conclusion You have to have something to protect eggs when car camping This isnt a maybe or luxury this is a real must have Luckily on our trip there was a store nearby so losing a half dozen eggs wasnt a huge deal but storing in these would have been a huge boon Another friend happened to have one of these and we put the next dozen purchased eggs in here for safe keeping You will not regret this purchase 
I recieved the item well withi in the estimated date I have not had a chance to use it just yet however it does seem a bit sturdier than most My main concern was the plastic hinge portion on some of the containers i have had in the past brok at this pont first So far it looks quite a bit more durable 
I love this We bring lots of eggs with us when we camp We enjoy a big family meal at breakfast time We have yet to have any cracked eggs Been using this for years now 
Just want to say that after reading negative reviews that this is a great unit contrary to other reviews the flame control was spot on i dont know if over pressure is the issue with other people about 15 to 30 pumps depending on fuel level Having used duel burner stoves and lanterns most of my life I guess its second nature for me Would definitely recommend this product 
Light uses white gas and fits perfectly into my backpack I store this guy in a plastic folders coffee can when I take it backpacking were I can also fit in utensils and some other goodies 
Ive always liked these Coleman fuel has longterm storability gasoline is less expensive Both work when it is way too cold for propane 20 F is often too cold to use small propane bottles I feel like they get hotter than propane too Small enough to take anywhere and very handy 
Stir fry in a big wok on a camp site is why I bought thing It will do fine 
Took a little while to figure out how to adjust it down to a simmer but aside from that its rock solid Its a blowtorch when you need it to be too which is great for cold weather when you need something hot to eat or drink fast 
This is great for bikes and tents Much easier to use than I expected 
This lightweight pump seems flimsy but is built to last apparently It truly is powerful enough to suck clogs out of the PVC condensate line and isnt bothered at all about getting wet It dries out and goes on to the next air bed pool float or what have you Over the years Ive tried plugin electric pumps as well as foot pumps and this is by far my favorite 
Perfect 
This stove is excellent No need to prime start right away The unique design get the gas heat up in no time and we get blue flame almost immediately The high n low flame control is a plus 
Great 
A good stovebut a litter bigger than I need I found that the Peak 1 meets my needs better than the 533  Wish Coleman still made the smaller stoves and lanterns 
bought this as a replacement to one I had for many years Coleman Doesnt get better 
Leaked gas 
I used this camping a few times and it worked great Then on a cold fall hunting trip I was trying to light it to heat dinner and instead of lighting the fuel started leaking out of the stove between the fuel tank and the burner What a mess a cold dinner and a shortened trip Look for a better quality stove 
Yep Im ready to cook just in case the South China Sea things goes Boom  
I was able to inflate a king sized airbed in 3 minutes Because of the dual action it blows air on the pull as well as the push It blows up the mattress so quickly that you have to pay attention that you dont accidentally over inflate Also because of the various adapters it will work for just about any item needing air The deflation is great too Gone are the days of spending 20 minutes trying to get the air out so that you can get you bed back in the box This worked so quickly that my only regret is not getting one sooner 
Does the job 
I bought it thinking it can be used as general purpose pump  to pump cycle tires  soccer balls etc  but I was mistaken  Its primarily for use for camping stuff such as airbed etc  but it was my mistake Works only with coleman products though 
works great 
Taken this egg container on 3 trips now Generally we dont take great care when loading items so the eggs had been broken many times in the past But not one egg has broken in this egg container We load it full with eggs and toss it in the cooler or fridge and dont have to worry about any broken eggs at all 
I love this stove I have two 3 burner stoves that I use often There are times however when only a 1 burner stove is needed This is a little jewel that does the task 
The 533 is a newer version of several previous similar versions that earned a reputation for reliability and perfection This stove has some of those characteristics The biggest flaw with the 533 is that it does not have the flame control of the previous Coleman single burner stoves  or at best some do and some dont depending on random luck The 533 models I have used or have seen seem to have two flame adjustments  HIGH FLAME or no flame No matter how carefully you tweek the red flame control lever you either have a flame thrower or the flame goes out For such a heavy and bulky single burner this one flaw makes it no better than the old SEA 123 or old Optimus stoves that roared to boil water fast or burn foods in frying pans The old faithful Coleman single burner stoves like the 508 were understood to be bulkier and a little heavier than some of the competitors but the quite flame and the infinite flame control convinced many backpackers and campers to use Coleman single burner stoves I would highly recommend some of the previous models like the Coleman 508 or others if you can find them but the 533 has few advantages to warrant the purchase 
I have three of these now They work better than a large Coleman stove I recommend getting the square plastic case for them I keep one in the house for emergencies and two in my mini camper to cook on I would not use it for backpacking but they are great for regular camping 
Very hardy stove for cooking onwould not trade or sell it its part of my must have camping items  
This is a perfect pump for my airbed for when I dont have my battery operated pump available on camping trips 
It works fine though its variety of tips still didnt fit the valve on my air mattress 
Works pretty good after two years Use it for many things thanks to the little size adapter things 
works every time 
the first time or two its complicated to get going but with the included instructions its easy great for camping may be a little large to have for an all out hike if you get the filter funnel it makes refilling super easy and eliminates any debris sticks or dirt from getting into the tank which is really hard to clean out 
Bought this stove for a motocamping trip and it performed wonderfully I ran it solely on unleaded fuel which was great because I didnt need to carry any special fuel I could just fill it up from my bike The stove comes with a fill funnel and funnel storage bag which was great and if you follow the included directions you should have no issues I do have to say that this stove may be a little large and heavy for those watching pack weight for backpacking But for car or motocamping this thing is a champ It will boil my quart of water in under 5 minutes 
Awesome little stove Perks coffee fast can use my cast iron skillet for cooking compactfits perfect in a folgers plastic coffee can Recently went camping on an island in a national park and this stove by far was the most valuable stove We had a couple other liquid fuel stoves too and they work great when your cooking a big meal but for making coffee heating up water for hot cocoa or washing dishes the little guy is superior Small enough that I have one stashed on the boat and a spare for the wheeler or snowmobile or back packing The btus you get from Coleman fuel compared to propane is like comparing apples to potatoes there is no comparison If you do use gasoline do yourself a favor and use only nonoxy premium If you use regular gas wether premium or not its blended with ethanol which takes its toll on all the components from the generator to the valve seals and rubber on the pump You wont regret buying this stove Use only Coleman fuel and itll last you decades 
Disclaimer I do not own this stove but would buy it in an instant if my older Coleman Exponent or Peak stoves died I once challenged a colleague with an MSR whisperlight stove to a dual boiling a cup of water I had my water boiling before he had his assembled and lit Also I take my Coleman stove on 8 day wilderness paddling trips with 79 people On my last trip with 7 people we consumed only 2 14 liters of fuel My colleagues with the MSR stoves take 5 liters of fuel Also inexperienced users could not operate the MSR but learned to operate the Coleman in 5 minutes It think the extra weight is worth the reliability efficiency speed and ease of use 
I like to have multiple options for cooking in emergencies or camping so I did some research on these stoves After deciding to try one out I picked one of these up lightly used on fleabay for 26 I cant see any reason to overpay for anything As far as some people having problems with these stoves I just cant imagine it This little stove is pretty awesome If you take the time to make sure your stove is properly pressurized it runs like a champ Its very efficient with the fuel use too I got an entire weekend camping trips worth of cooking for my family of 4 out of a single fillup of Coleman fuel That leads me to another important point If you dont want your generator gumming up dont run cheap unleaded gas in this thing Sure you can do it but its like running poor grade fuel in your car You want to spring for the pure clean stuff this stove was meant to run best on If you have the good sense to set the stove up on a flat level surface as you should youll have no trouble using a full sized cast iron skillet on this stove I did it My wife even heated her up some water for her tea in a mil spec canteen cup on this thing I thought she was nuts but it worked and did it very quickly She did use my pot glove to remove her cup for safetys sake My stove seems to have no problem adjusting anywhere from a low simmering flame to a blast furnace I honestly thought it would be a high or low only option but you can finesse the controls to get the output you want Its not featherlight but its not a boat anchor either Id say its worth its weight in your gear It really isnt huge coming in at under 6 inches tall and about 5 12 inches or so across at the base but it has a heft to it being made of steel I guess the best praise I can give this stove is that once she used it my wife didnt give me crap about buying it Thats the official seal of approval in a married mans house Mine was made in August of 03 so these things can apparently last a good while with proper care 
I bought this pump for blowing up my fishing tube float and with the attached hose it is quick and easy You can use the battery clips or the accessory outlet in the car for power I also bought the Coleman 12 Volt pump without the small hose for another location in case I forgot to bring one of them With the included adapters it will blow up a lot of water toys or air mattresses 
The description says itll inflate a boat but I think they mean a pool toy because it didnt even come close to inflating mine I returned it and bought a manual river boat pump and in a few strokes it gets more air in than 15mins of using this tiny whining motor I am glad it didnt work because I didnt want to endure that noise early in the morning at camp LOL I wouldnt rely on it for an airbed 
Classic reliable lots of heat fussy to start but with practice works well 
I like it The only thing I worry about is the pot falling off I keep the kids away from this when it is lit to avoid trouble Gets the job done 
This was very handy on our last camping trip It frees up space on the picnic table or whatever surface you happen to be cooking on The shelf is sturdy and engages the camp stove very well It rained several times over our camping weekend and by the time we got packed up the unit was starting to rust I was a little disappointed in this 
Used as Kite pump for kite boarding works great If you buy a pump leash you will need to drill a hole or add a strap to attach it to the pump I guess kiteboarding pumps normally come with a hole on the base 
Works great Fills up the air mattress quickly and I love that I can use it to suck out the air when I want the air mattress completely flat My brother in law said Ive got an electric pump but I had the mattress filled before he could get his electric pump working 
I have 3 ways to inflate This is my first choice to top off the air to make my canoe seaworthy 
Sure you could get a battery powered pump but how is your girlfriend going to feel if your batteries die and shes stuck sleeping on a deflated mattress Yeah you arent going camping anymore Man up and pump by hand 
We use this all of the time I bought it for a air mattress love that it blows things up and it reverses so it totally deflates I can actually store any product back in the original box It only takes minutes to inflate and deflate Great 
Excellent purchase 
compact and burns dual fuels a good stove at a good price 
This burner is the best easiest toughest burner out there Great heating power easy to use and resistant 
I gave this to my son for scouts he uses it on his outings I also have this stove or that model they made then from the late 80s for my time in scouts I still have it today and it works 
would have got five if it were lighter this thing works great though 
Works great very pleased 
Great concept but could not use BEWARE does not fit the newer stoves I tried to use it with a Triton 
Got this for my wife as birthday present While camping she was mentioning that cooking tools ans spices are never handy So I was looking for a solution We cook on a two burner Coleman luiquid fuel stove The set fits on the lid when its folded up Now she has all nearby as she wanted The material is quite solid and will hopefully last 
After receiving what I thought would be a lifesaver for our families frequent camping trips I was disappointed when it would not stay on my stove I have a newer Coleman model that has a wider lip on it than the one in the picture I went back and checked the listing and nowhere did it say what model numbers this rack was meant for Ended up giving it to a friend as I had not saved the box and had no use for it It works great on his stove  had the seller informed me of the proper model number needed I would have given this a 5 star rating 
Been using this every year since I purchased it Highly recommend It helps keep our hectic camping style stay a bit more organized Glad I got it 
This item was better than expected Puts the utensils where you want them and spices too Very handy with limited space or the deep dark woods 
We have a Coleman 428 3burner stove and this innovative utensil rack fit onto the lid of the stove perfectly Having all of our cooking utensils within easy reach was very convenient and we loved the spice rack as well Granted there are no directions on how to install the rack but its pretty self explanatory and we had it set up in seconds 
These lanterns are simple to operate and nothing else on the market gives off the amount of light they do I liked it so much that I bought another one Itll be easy to find me when youre camping my camp site will be the one with all the lights 
I love this little lantern It seems to hold the quality standard of Colemans old lanterns I love that you can burn lantern fuel or standard gasoline I have only burned Coleman lantern fuel but it is nice to know that gas is an option I plan to try it soon since gas is so much cheaper It gets nice and bright 
Worth every penny Dependable unit Bright adjustable light You may want to buy a few of the lanterns along with it as emergency backups Buy a coleman stove and your set for winter camping in the UP 
WOW Bought this for use with a Coleman twin sized quick bed I wasnt sure I would actually need it but was really glad we had it on hand This thing filled up the air mattress in no time at all Its very well made and durable I imagine it will also come in handy for filling rafts floats etc around our beach house Nice 
I recently ordered an Coleman mattress that came with a pretty worthless 4D batteryoperated pump That battery pump barely inflated the mattress on a fresh set of batteries and was completely INCAPABLE of pumping up an air mattress to REALLY FIRM levels like I prefer So I bought this COLEMAN LARGE DUAL ACTION hand pump and by large  it means large and incharge First its about a foot high and 3 times the thickness of a bicycle pump Second it absolutely dominated the air situation and effortlessly pumped up the remaining air in the mattress to rockhard levels So I think I will continue to use the pumps together in that configuration because Im lazythe battery pump to get it mostly full and the handpump to bring the firmness up to usable levels Totally worth the  
Works fantastic It operates different then the traditional pump which only pumps air in when you push down this does the reverse 
This is cheaper than an electric pump but dont think that it is too easy Be prepared to use some muscle with this That said this is fantastic item It is more versatile than most electric options because it can fill and pump out That means that you can pump up your air mattress and also pump out the air when you are done to store it very compactly This alone make it better than electric Combined with the low price and manual operation it is the best buy for pumps 
This is the stove that started it all Perfect in every way I love it Get one and you will fall in love 
works great 
Outstanding product And easy to pack away 
Quite simply this kit is rubbish And dangerous too It is so crude and flimsy that you will have an ordeal trying to boil a cup of water for tea let alone cook anything and will quite likely burn yourself in the process Say you try to boil a cup of water You use the included tiny tiny pot with handle First of all the handle hangs down at just the right angle to get red hot in the stoves flame Next when you lift the pot using tongs the red hot handle will burn through gloves it tips right over and dumps the boiling water everywhere It just hangs freely from that wire handle and since its so crudely made is unbalanced and tips its contents out as soon as its lifted After youve burned yourself and lost all your boiled water you might try to cook something in the frying pan First you try to assemble the handle with the screw and wingnut problem is that the metal of the handle and mounting tab is so thin that you cant even tighten the bolt fully so the pan flops about from side to side Good luck tipping anything out of the pan without a mess Next if you put anything in the pan that weighs more than an ounce or two the handle simply bends Even a 12 of water is enough to bend the handle The whole kit is absolute rubbish Oh and the handle of the mug gets too hot to handle if you succeed in sloshing any hot water into it Dont waste your time or money 
I didnt pay much attention to the dimensions of the items in this kit I should have broke out the measuring tape This stuff is tiny It might be good for very small meals for one person or child but for two adults its just too small The largest piece may be able to cook 4 eggs at best and the pan might be able to cook a can of something as long as its a normal can not one of the jumbo cans of beef stew or something I gave it three stars for three reasons its dirt cheap it probably would be perfect for one person who doesnt eat much and it all fits into itself in a great little compact item which would be perfect if youre trying to save space 
Hurricane Sandy convinced me to become aware of how fragile life can be When she hit I could not buy a flashlight lantern or battery anywhere for weeks Since then my attitude of awareness has increased 10 fold and I am now prepared for the next event This lantern was worth the money In fact after buying this item on Amazon I found a closeout special at Walmart They were selling this identical lantern for 2500  I bought 2 more  I also purchased 4 gallons of Coleman fuel Since owning it I have only used the Coleman fuel It runs flawlessly and lasts a long time on a full tank I also have 2 Coleman Duel Fuel stoves and combined they make a great survival kit Be sure to purchase addition mantles and a spare plunger It goes without saying that uses combustible fuel and must be used outside A couple of these along with a few oil lamps will keep you with light A rocketbiomass stove will keep you with a source to boil water and cook food You just never know 
Great 
I burned about a gallon of unleaded No problems I love it 
very good just what I wanted 
I had an ancient Coleman Peak One for backpacking I started bike touring and for some reason thought I should get an MSR stove because of all the hype about how light and wonderful they are Pfffft The Peak One was almost 15 years old and I never had any issues ever of it starting It always worked well fired up regardless of how cold it was Burns efficiently Takes a beating as far as being accidentally dropped and being jostled around in backpacks or panniers The MSR was temperamental It leaked Wasnt as efficient pretty much burned at high no matter what couldnt simmer Then during my trip it died completely I woke up to a 48 degree morning and couldnt make my coffee or breakfast That was it I sold my Peak One so I had to replace it I opted for getting this Coleman to have the flexibility of burning gasoline when I was traveling through remote areas that didnt have white gas Yes its bigger and a tad heavier than an MSR but keep in mind MSR you need to have the fuel bottles and they dont include that in the weight When you consider the fuel bottles into the MSR weight and space it takes the Coleman isnt that much heavier or space hogging Considering its reliability and sturdiness I think its worth every ounce Plus you have the option to simmer Ill never doubt you Coleman unsung hero of cyclers and hikers 
so far havent been able to get it to workfollowed the instructionsnada 
item was as described 
Excellent deal Used in travel 
I bought this for backpacking However it is heavier than I would have liked It is a good stove and great for car camping or for a picnic 
I was exausted after I pumped two twin air beds and my daughter at 19 made the full size air bed She said she wouldnt try again It is greener than a battery or electronic one but you have to be strong enough to pull and push to use it  It will take over hundred push to finish a twin bed 
Coleman is a trusted brand but Im not so sure I trust this pump to stand up to more than occasional use It is plastic and you have to stand on it to use it Theres your first worry You can literally feel how cheaply made this pump is The thing is though the pump worked well so far It inflates AND deflates beds pool toys and other things with large intake nozzles So it has that going for it Unfortunately the pump is a chore to use It is very short Pumping is not made any easier by the thoughtless length of the pump and the plastic parts It wobbles and feels sometimes like it is on the verge of cracking I cannot recommend this pump unless you get it very cheap I think it is another example of how American companies have turned to shoddy workmanship for a quick buck Yes it does work But for how long Buyer beware I guess 
not bad at all took about 70pumps to get my regular size twin mattress fully pumped few minutes of work but i was a bit winded afterwordsthen again im not in the best of shape has adapters that fit snugly into the bed interface 
Great for pumping up air mattresses I had to make an adapter to use it on some Thermarest pads which it inflates in 30 strokes Although it is bulky it is surprisinly light weight if you needed to carry it 
This kind of airbed pump is rather ubiquitous It work wells at filling up airbeds quickly and will deflate them quite well too The only nitpick I have is that the hose attaches to the handle so its easier to pull the hose out of the airbed while filling it Its much easier to do with two people so that one of you can hold the hose in the airbed but that would be true of any manual pump 
It works It doesnt have an easy capacity for BALL inflation though which I didnt realize and which is also rather annoying But inflating yoga balls works 
PROS This pot is very sturdy paint is high quality strong handle lid has a lip that if installed properly should not fall out Has a nice chrome ring at the top of the pot where the lid fits in a spot that is vulnerable to chip in most enamel pots This smaller model is also good for heating water for tea hot chocolate and dishes I have one for that purpose and the 14 cup model for coffee I prefer percolators over drip coffeemakers I have never had to replace a stove top percolator because it was broken but have owned countless expensive drip coffeemakers Breakable carafes clock to reset takes up counterspace buttons to fuss with filters to replace My simple pot lasts years longer I have one from the 1940s and the cleanup and maintenance is simpler CONS Like a drip there is a learning curve This type of pot does not have a water marker for example But there is a simple instruction sheet in the box Next many of the new percolator pots have strainer baskets that are really flimsy in design including both the Coleman and the GSI brand The real problem is the upright stem it tilts over if you know what I mean If they improved the basket assembly with a heavier grade aluminum or stainless steel I think it would solve the problem I replaced the upright stem and basket in mine with an old sturdy one from a old pot I found at a yard sale For some weird reason most of the manufacturers basket is the same size no matter how big the pot is Most stainless steel kitchen non camp models have a stainless basket Last on models with the glass dome some folks can break them They sell replacements in 2 sizes at Amazoncom for less than a pack of paper filters The good news is that Coleman will mail you a replacement dome for free if you break it email them through their web site seems to be the best way to get this done I am guessing they would also replace the filter TIPS Wet the inside of the basket before you put grounds in to help prevent grounds from going through the holes Use a medium ground blend If you plan to use it on a camp fire soap the outside of the pot and let dry for a minute before placing on the fire to prevent soot stains If you do it every time it will stay looking like new RECOMMENDATION Coleman also sells a 12 cup and a 14 cup in this shape the 14 cup is my favorite and looks identical with the exception of the additional glass dome to monitor the coffee percolating The 12 cup is Stainless Steel and also has a dome Their competitor GSI makes an 8 cup in red or blue 
Great for car camping and emergencies Runs great even in windy conditions Ive been using super premium 93 octane gasoline and havent had a problem 
Love it We have a small raft with limited room for gear on long trips This is perfect for my compact rafting kitchen box A little heavy for backpacking 
I was rather unhappy to find out that this camp stove contains lead There is nothing that states this warning in the description However upon arrival there is Californias mandated warning Chances are you will be touching the stove while cooking Expected better from Coleman Other than containing a neurotoxin and contributing to birth defects the stove appears to be built rather solid 
Love it  Works really well Im using it with regular gasoline because I dont want to carry 2 or 3 different type of gas Easy to use too Of course it smell gasoline once its off but that OK It is true that when you turn off the gas it continues to burn for 2 or 3 minutes until the pipe is empty but you just have to know it Great product 
Excellent backpack stove Multifuel ensures youre never a victim of highway robbery looking for Coleman white gas in whatever corner of the world you find yourself Primes quickly and hasslefree unlike pressurized gas Although Ive yet to test it in the cold its easliy apparent by design that this thing can handle it with ease Large tank cooked for 2 of us over 3 days and still had fuel when we made it back Pair it with an MSR 20oz Fuel bottle and disappear for a week 
Good 
The pole is not bad It is very light and easy to adjust the height The compass was broken when I got it I am not sure it was damaged during shipping or the seller sent me a bad one I asked for refund and Amazon gave me paidpost stick to print I am waiting for the money that I will use to buy another one if I get it 
Grew up with coleman IT JUST DOESNT FEEL RIGHT If I dont have to pump the lantern Its just not Campin Its like when you go campin to enjoy the out doors and your brotherinlaw brings a TV with a battery pack I guess Im just old 
I bought two of them and have tried both for a short test run Both run quietly and effectively Have not used them on an actual camping trip I bought one of the plastic cases and wish they would offer a case like I had for my old Coleman My old lantern case was larger but had a double layered shell with a storage place for parts such as generators and mantles plus a storage slot for a fuel funnel 
Excellent thank you 
This was good deal and fast 
I like it puts out wright light at night 
Very good 
This product has been something of a disappointment for me doing full 360 now on the propane kind of surprised at the level of soot this thing leaves on the pot even when using Colemans clean white gas I mean compared to clean burning propane I wanted to get away from propane canisters but you have to remember that propane only has a footprint of 3 carbons and gas is between 6 and 10 Im thinking Colemans being a 6 maybe I have decided to just get some better propane equipment and just refuel the bigger tanks and use adapters 
In digging thru the stuff in my garage I found a square Coleman pot and lid with one of the original stoves inside I bought it used maybe 25 or so years ago I has been sitting in the garage all that time Im sure I tried it when I got it but probably never took it camping Well anyway I removed the cap and there was fuel inside It was no doubt Coleman fuel because thats all I ever used Well here is the end you probably expect I pumped it up and hit it with a light and and  it worked like a champ also like a stove Who would have thunk it 
Classic camp stove and heater typical Coleman product nice thing is the old generator has been done away with which was a minor problem if poor grade fuel was used 
This is a pump You pull the handle up then you push the handle down When you do this air comes out of the nozzle That air goes into the inflatable product you are trying to inflate The product works it is easy to use it fills an air mattress quickly and it comes with a nice range of tips for different types of inflatables At the price it is a must have for anyone who ever fills any inflatable product 
You have to jam the big hole adapter firmly into the thing you want to blow up but that works fine 
Bought to fill full size air mattresses I have two mattresses that will need to be filled for camping It takes about 10 mins to fill I bought manual hand pump because I didnt want to have to depend on electricity 
I finally received this product on the 6th March 2014 I ordered it on the 15th January 2014 hoping to received it on time for my camping trip from the 1st 5th March 2014 I eventually had to purchase another pump since I had no idea it I would receive this on time Then I finally received it today and the packaging was way too big the box it came in could have held at least 4 pumps The box was so big it cost me twice the cost of the pump to clear it I am so disappointed that I couldnt use the pump or even receive it on time I would not purchase anything from this supplier again Hope the pump works well after all of this The pump that I received was different to the one I ordered I received a red pump slightly smaller then to make matters worse the price of the pump dropped to 994 after I paid 2042 for it 
I have yet to understand why these things are so expensive theyre cheaply made and basically have one simple job  boil water Regardless the pot itself does what it should and is as durable as can be expected from China but take care with the internal parts  they are very thin metal and can benddamage easily The enamelware was worth the extra money as the water doesnt have the metallic aftertaste that stainless steel pots leave Four stars for being so danged expensive and the insides being so chinsy 
I wanted a pot to brew tea but I didnt want a tea kettle Too hard to clean those and I wanted something I could put in the dishwasher This fit the bill I dont use the percolator part so I have nothing to say about that I just boil water and steep tea in it and it does great I only give it 45 stars though because of a cosmetic imperfection The handle is twotoned black granite on one side and blue on the other Does not affect the function of the pot but I leave it on my stove top all the time and it bugs me a little Not enough to request a replacement though 
Perfect 
Great little lantern Ive only run gas in mine and its worked great I havent broken it so far and I motly use it for trail building out in the woods in the PNW Just like the lantern your grandpa had 
nice lantern for car camping 
This is the best lantern out there Inexpensive to operate Kerosene is the only thing cheaper Works great Bright Easy to fill pump and runs for hours and hours Runs for hours on High even Will light up an entire camp site for real Runs great on unleaded gasoline as well so you can always find fuel even when you are somewhere without campgas Coleman fuel available 
Like it But before the first use RTFM  Work well with regular gasoline I havent tried with this Coleman special fuel but the fact is I bought it because I always have a full 10 gal fuel tank at the back of the Jeep and I dont want to have 10 diferent type of fuel with me The thing is the smell is probably a little stronger with regular gasoline Just make sure you have extra mantle with you 
I am a true trekking fan i really go up hills very often as a hobbie so i wanted a decent low price pole after all it is a hobbie Anyways beside all bad references about the falling tip for this pole i decided to trust the brand coleman and the price MISTAKE My fellow reviewers were totally right That tip is pure junk but as a said for the price i think it is OK for it to be junk Very desappointed on respected brand Coleman thought 
I bought this for my Venturing Crew It is easy to use even for the youngest in our crew Versitility is great It is a little heavy with fuel in it Very dependable I will be taking this on a 12 day trek at Philmont 
Okay this stove isnt one of those tiny stoves for Ultra Light Backpacking I knew that before I bought it as I lost on of these in one of my many moves That being said I love this stove Its like a refillable rocket you carry in your pack or your car The Good the Bad and the Ugly The Good It boils water faster than just about anything on the market It will also light and burn in just about any conditions you can imagine It also simmer like you wouldnt believe It put out an incredible amount of heat The Bad It takes some work to get lit you have to pump it up and when its cold out you might have to prime it The Ugly For a Backpacking Stove this thing weighs a ton Not only is it heavy but you have to pack in fuel Its also loud Final thoughts This stove is one of my favorite stoves and is never left behind Its heavy its loud and it needs fuel but it will never fail you There is a reason why this stove design has been around so long 
Solid build and just the right size Works well but seems a little pricey Good for camping or when the power goes out for a long time 
Received in a timely fashion Sturdy and durable feel with an excellent performance Not for the ultralight crowd But for a weekend or car camping trip this heavy duty inferno would be ideal 
This stove works well and is easy to use i bought this to use outside when I camp in my travel trailer This is a bit too large for backpacking Also the gas valve fits in another Coleman stove I have 
I purchased this along with a doubleheight queen Coleman mattress The pump doesnt seem to be the highest quality plastic but I cannot determine longevity based on that subjective observation It took me about 10 minutes to blow up the mattress  which is big  so its good exercise for sure Its not an ultraquiet alternative to an electronic pump as you might think I expect it would work great on smaller mattresses The pump is bigger than I expected it to be but I guess thats to be expected given the larger volume of air it has to move Its bigger than it appears in the photo and mine was red not black However the fact that it inflates on both the down and up strokes is pretty clever Overall I like the pump and for the price I would highly recommend it as a backup for an electronic pump 
This style pump is faster than the small portable coleman and u dont have to remember to charge it A guy had one out jetskiing one day when my little rechargeable coleman died after many years of good service Used one of these to inflate a two person seadoo tube in a couple minutes It inflates as u retract it also so its twice as fast It was awesome So I bought one now as well 
Tested this pump in my backyard to blow up a queen size air mattress and it took 75 full pumps and I was done 10 minutes I then used it for the realdeal camping trip and while others were manually blowing up their mattresses by mouth I was done setting up my camp and sitting in my chair enjoying the scenery I also like that is it semicompact for storing with other camping gearcarrying Top quality pump made by a leader in the industry other reason I purchased was the Coleman name I highly recommend this pump to anyone needing to blow up air mattresses in short time and not be worn out in the process 
I bought this to inflate my 4 in 1 Coleman airbeds It works just as advertised and works well It blows air on each movement of the handle up and down hence the dual action label It has a variety of attachments that can be installed to the end of the tube for various types of inflate valves I dont have anything other than the Coleman airbeds so I dont know how well it works for nonColeman products Id be surprised if you couldnt get it to work for anything with a similarlysized diameter valve My pump is red not black like the one pictured No big deal but if youre ordering by the color of it you could be let down 
NEW ADDITION FOR AN EXTRA BACKPACK CANT WAIT TO USE IT ON OUR BACKPACK HIKING AND FISHING TRIP 
This kit is a little smaller than I was hoping for7 or 8 inches x2 but its small size and very lightweight construction make it a must since it takes very little room If I had to guess it weights 6 or 8 ounces total But because its thin aluminum Im not sure how it would handle direct flame Myself I have no intention of doing so only for serving and dining But we shall see if theres any catastrophic events like melting or warping Ill let you know 
Its made of aluminum so it dents and punctures easy Itd be good for a disposable mess kit but thats about it 
Not your everyday camping type of mess kit but it does work enough to feed yourself and and a friend 
I was excited to get one of these sets for my son after using a 70s model for years Well these new ones are absolute junk The pan actually dented from me cracking an EGG on it the first use I crushed the set up and threw it away 
light weight mess kit  sized for one person a good starter kit for novices  
If youre looking at this item its likely for camping Camping goods should be durable This is not The coffee we made was good Tough to watch the progress but if you quickly reduce the heat once it boils and perc for 10 minutes its great The problem is that a 2 ft fall to gravel chips the enamel on the lid which falls off if you dont hold it on when pouring Once chipped the rust sets in over night Were going for one of the stainless ones and this one is going to the recycle bin I dont recommend getting it when there are better options out there 
The lid is so tight we tried to pry it off with a screw driver when it first arrived Now the top is chipped and if it had hot anything in it a huge burn would occur I use it as a flower pot Coleman what have you not done right 
This product is unfortunately junk The construction of it allows the coffee grounds to seep out of the percolator as soon as it boils I purchased this after a trip with friends that owned a comparable GSI model of camp percolator Up to this point we had been using a Coleman French Press which is a great product Upon opening the box I noticed that the internal tin coffee filter didnt fit as tight as the model I had used and that there was no glass window into the coffee pot to verify that the boiling water is turning to percolating coffee Taking this on another weeklong camping trip in midAugust 2012 I used this Really a bad experience unless you like coffee grounds in your finished product After 6 days of gritty coffee decided to return it and order the other brand of product I would not recommend this product to a friend 
This is the first time Ive written a review on Amazon after years of purchasing here I just feel that this item may not be safe I had purchased these for my 2 year old to use since they dont break like glass Grandma gave us one that he liked but was many years old So I order these for home and at Grandmas Within a few weeks of occasional use the blue enamel started flaking off of the lip of 2 cups and the contents didnt taste quite right Great What is it made of and how much of it that have we ingested So I dont recommend giving these to anyone you love ps made in china 
Great cup the color actually matches the Coleman blue color on their coffeepot This is good to know as there are a couple of other brands of these cups but the color is off next to the Coleman pot So buy the same brand cup as your coffee pot if you want the color to match They also sell them as a set of 4 cups separately at Amazon and you can get a set that has dishes and the cups from Coleman too As with all enamelware it is metal and stays hot if you put a hot liquid in it So be careful and learn how to use it without getting burned sip at the edge like a cowboy

This is a good pole for the price One problem with the pole is that it is difficult to extend because the tubes are tight It is easy to pull it apart because there is not detent or stop and a pain to reassemble 
I had looked at another brand that was almost 3 times more expensive but decided the coleman name would be a great product I was right these are everything the higher priced items advertised I found them easy to adjust and love the grip If you are looking for a great set of walking poles look no further 
Love this lantern Brings back all the childhood memories of being dragged to a campsite by my parents Now that I am a grown up I will do the dragging You can literally leave this lantern buried in a garage for a few decades I did and it will still work perfectly the next time you bust it out It will also be perfect for when the apocalypse hits it can run on either coleman fuel or regular gasoline No need for electricity batteries or bulbs Just the little mantle which can also last for decades mine did 
sunlight at night Watch outif u use this gas lantern youll light up the entire campground let alone your campsite 
Its nice to know that these are still available For emergency lighting if it is already fueled up then it is always ready to give some light wherever it might be needed  no worries about dead batteries Once the mantles are burned in and working it is necessary to be careful not to damage them since they are a bit fragile Other than that it is a great source of quite a lot of light for not much money 
well build common mantles 21 uses while fuel or gasoline makes some soot with gas so i try to use white fuelcoleman fuel fill pump open valve lite and it warms up for like 510 seconds and you are good all night the only brighter lantern is the slightly brighter Dual fuel Powerhouse and then the slightly brighter than that northstar dual fuel globes are easily found at target big5 walmart REI for 510 MAntles are 250 for a pair at those same stores 
I do not recommend or condone indoor use but I did use this stove to heat up my garage for many years I certainly burned more fuel doing that than actually cooking which it also does very well Easily put 50 gallons thru this unit before it finally gave out I probably could have repaired it but I felt I got my moneys worth 
I have always been a duel fuel Coleman fan so I had to get this stove I took it backpacking and it is a bit heavy for that use Full tank of fuel will last you about 3 days with 3 meals a day Less if you have to use it to boil drinking water 
This is a very well made dual fuel liquid fuel stove that you can actually use to prepare food or boil water And unlike the propane single burners one can get fuel for this baby anywhere at anytime even in survival situations This is one of my favorite pieces of gear Simple reliable and sure to please 
Heats well easy to light and does use both fuel products Just like a little burner Easy to store away too 
After reading numerous reviews and searching YouTube videos I decided to buy this liquid fuel stove It arrived on time and in perfect condition The instructions are included in the box as well as imprinted on the side of the burner To date I have only used Coleman brand fuel This unit works like a dream It will boil a canteen cup of water in about 5 minutes It is relatively lightweight and with a full fuel tank lasts a LONG time between refills I consider myself an sensible prepper and look for quality in my purchases I liked this unit so much I ordered another one Now I have one for my truck EDC and one for home It is very easy to use and makes a welcomed addition to my Trangia alcohol stove and my homemade wood burning hobo stove I have used this stove for about 6 months now on kayaking trips and for camping Not even a hiccup I have Coleman fuel on hand but I like the idea of being able to use unleaded gasoline in a pinch I would recommend this stove to anyone looking for a quality cooking source at a great price 
Great for car camping when you cant have or dont want to wait for a camp fire Only complaint is that I wish their was a larger grate that could be added on top to create more stability for light items like small coffee perks or small pans Just seems a little wobbly but so far havent actually had a problem with it 
This is perfect for the night fishing Hot water or hot chow this gets it done Out of camp fuel just fill with some unleaded gas and your set to go Fits in the tool truck bed box doesnt take up a ton of space and its light 
Perfect for our Scouts Everything you need for eating at camp Washes easily stores small and nice quality 
Excellent set Husband loves it for camping 
Havent tried it yet but have used similar ones Dont see why this one is any different 
very small 
This is a nice little duel pump it is small enough to throw in the car but not so tiny that it takes a year to inflate things 
I know in todays world of portable electronics and even portable power its easy to just buy a battery or AC powered pump but let me tell you on many camping trips this thing saved my bacon Its the most powerful hand pump Ive ever used The attachments for connecting to various valve types are permanently fixed to the end of the output tube so you wont lose them and they are right there for quick changing So obviously this thing is great when you are camping and the batteries die or you forget your portable pump but even better this thing will fill your air mattress faster and firmer So leave the electronics at home Another awesome benefit of this pump came when starting campfires Especially if your wood is damp Get your fire started and use one of the fine nozzle attachments to blow a jet stream of air directly on the flamescoals and in no time you will have a blaze going If you are a prepper this is a must have in your bag of tricks I might buy another 
Pumped up the air mattress fairly quickly 5min without too much strain on the back Like the attached nozzles for options Sick of lousy battery operated units 
This is a nice little set It feels a bit cheap but I guess I shouldnt be complaining for the price Its lightweight and stores together nicely My only suggestion is to make sure that you dont put to much weight on the handle 
great for backpacking handle is flimsy but what do you expect for something so light 
In my opinion this is a four star mess kit I bought it for my 72 hour emergency kit The mess kit is compact and everything nests nicely Ive used it twice just to try it out Nice price Good quality Only complaint would be the extended handle is a bit cumbersome due to the long length I feel better having this mess kit in case of any natural disaster I may find myself in 
This works good for single fires when camping Heat coffee warm soup have not tried it on gas but works well on white gas 
As a companion to my DualFuel lantern this 1burner Sporter II stove has the same flexibility and features as more expensive stoves along with the ability to use white gas or unleaded in a pinch  use of unleaded will gum up the works a bit sooner as it doesnt burn as cleanly as white gas but its always there as an emergency option if you get to the campground only to find that you forgot the Coleman gas in the garage Easy to light simple to use and good moderation of the temperature output makes this individual stove a great backup to a larger Coleman stove setup so youll have all your bases covered Its also small enough to throw in a camping box or chuck box and not get in the way What more can I say really You could go Peak or JetBoil and spend a heck of a lot more and still end up with boiling water inside of 5 minutes  but as a cost effective stove for a backpacker or weekend adventurer this is just the ticket 
most of my campin gear is coleman have tentsstoves and lanterns of several fuel sources  batteries naphta keroseneand propane all have performed to expectation this stove was not the exception  
Coleman makes some really good products I like this because you dont have to keep buying propane cylinders that get tossed after use much cheaper to buy unleaded gas at your local station and lasts so much longer than propane 
I replaced an older white gas Coleman lantern with this new dualfuel lantern The dimensions were nearly identical so it fit the hard shell case that I had for the older green lantern The 21 mantles are also the same so I didnt have to waste the five or six extra pairs that I already had First burn was easy and it works just like it should Leaving on a mountain camping trip in a few days and fully confident that it will work for the next 15 years just like the old green one did 
I often catch fish at night I used to use flashlights but they give a bunch of light directed When I bought this lamp I threw flashlights The lamp illuminates the great fishing spot She eats little fuel Light such that you can perfectly read a book waiting for the signal bite Lamp taxing on fuel and works great on the same fuel as my boat motor Now this lamp I have always with you 
Lantern didnt light properly and when I finally got to light it was flaming real bad and putting out black smoke I was using Coleman Kerosene in blue quart bottle new bottle Followed instructions and I have had other Coleman lanterns without any problems After initial lighting I had to turn control valve down to get it to quit flaming and smoking The mantles were burning somewhat normal at that point I then turned it up to full open and it started flickering with and occasional flicker of flame Not a happy camper Im going to switch to Propane lantern Ive read other reviews on this same DuelFuel lantern where they had the same problem after being used a couple of times So Im not going to risk trying another one 
My old coleman lantern finally gave way after 30 years The new dualfuel lantern works just as well Is a little lighter and shorter but works just as well 
This hand pump seems to take a long time to get an airbed to fully inflate I have since upgraded to a battery powered unit 
I really like this hand pump I had a Coleman battery pump that I used for my wifes and my camping air mattresses for about 20 years but it finally gave up the ghost and I decided to go manual and purchased this I dont regret it Yes it takes a little more time and effort but its less noisy and doesnt require a battery to recharge or an electrical outlet to try to locate One tip Ive found that will make it far easier to use this pump is to sit down while you are pumping This gives you much greater leverage and requires less effort an important consideration during hot humid times you are out in the middle of nowhere or anywhere else for that matter 
This is a great pump for air mattresses I have a rechargeable pump that works ok but it usually cant quite fill the air mattress up all the way This is great to either top off the air mattress or to fill from scratch It will still take a while if you are filling the whole thing and because it is fairly big it can be a bit of a hassle filling the air mattress inside a tent but it works really well 
Purchased for an upcoming camping trip Was trying to avoid having to use the battery powered blowers so I bought this Tested it by inflating our king mattress and found it wasnt that efficient While I imagine it is so much better than using your lungs I decided it was just better to buy the Coleman battery powered blower It would be satisfactory if you didnt want to rely on battery power or car chargerplugs although there are cheaper brands out there that would probably be just as good 
These are not bad for disposable camping gear They are very flimsy almost like extra durable aluminum foil if that makes sense We used them for a weekend and they worked fine but we tossed them on the way out as they burnt up really bad over the fire For the price theyre just fine for probably 23 days of cooking 
you would have better luck cooking stuff out of an old beer can a hobo left on the ground The metal in this kit is foil thin I stepped on it by mistake destroyed it For something that is designed for camping it should be a little more tough than this I promise the China plates in your grannys house is tougher than this stuff 
great 
I love it I use it in the tent at cross country for heat Plus I use it in the spring for a secondary source for sugaring my small maple sap production Its not made for large scale items but it works great 
A very well made product I have bought four of these to give to my children for emergency use Dont hesitate on this one 
Ill say the same thing about this stove that Ive said about the lanternThis is much better than stoves that require those green propane throw away tanksfuel is much cheaper and lasts so much longer I will say that this is the second Coleman fuel stove I have owned The last one had developed a small leak in it over time Be sure to empty it after your camping trip and always release the pressure after every use and they will last a lot longer 
Great little stove for backpacking Heats water fast lite weight Put mine in a 3lb folgers coffee can to carry in my pack 
A great product The burner is very easy to use extremely robust to the fuel Now Im always on fishing with hot food 
If you need a stove to go camping this is the one I like that I can use unleaded gasoline or colemans white gas Just wished that it came with a storage  protection case like the lanterns sometimes do 
CAMPING 
I purchased this for by BOB it does what it needs to I used it in the back yard with the kids Used a fuel cube to bring water to a boil and works great Note while walking around with BOB it does make noise while taking steps Good product and cost effective 
This is great for camping Works perfect and cleans up easy 
One of my Sons is on his own now I have So many memories of our past camping trips I gave him my well used Coleman lantern and replaced it with this new one  
Perfect size 
Only tried with Coleman fuel so far and it works extremely well I had difficulty figuring out the way pump functions there are no instructions in the manual This is why the four stars 
This little stove packs a big bang It is awesome I have been using the stove on the back porch every day I make my tea and eggs in the morning It also helps to cook dinner We dont cook at all inside when the air is running Why heat the house when you can cook on the porch Put 6 eggs in a pot bring it to a boil and let set Hard boils eggs Its fast to 
The unit can be a little tricky to get lit with several steps of priming and opening the valve in a certain combination Once it is lit you have to constantly adjust it to try to keep it at a certain flame size and you can forget about keeping it at a low flame setting as it will go out That is because the flame vaporizes the gas in the copper hose that runs over it and if the flame is not hot enough it goes out If you open the valve for more gas it increases the flame size initially but then as the hose gets hotter and vaporizes more fuel the flame continues to grow The unit is high quality and durable but it is just outdated technology If you are old fashioned and more comfortable with something you are already familiar with or if you absolutely need to use liquid fuel for some reason then this is a good stove I returned it and got a propane stove that is so much easier to use and maintain a consistent flame size Just turn it on light it and adjust the flame size that simple Plus propane seems to be more readily available than Coleman fuel perhaps that is because liquid fuel stoves are a dying breed 
Light but terrible for meals that adhere to the surface of the potpan 
Nice but VERY soft aluminum Not as tough as the old units 
The lock feature keeps them together That really kicks a 
Works well 
A camping classic Id like them more if they locked together when stowed so they dont rattle about 

I am traveling much with the car and have it in there When we have a break we use it to heat our food quickly up Additionally this cooker is to be used when as prepare fish outdoors especially in winter The cooker is robust and works great One liter of water boils in just 4 mins great 
I love this new stove I especially like the fact that it runs on unlead gas as well Heats evenly Very nice for the coffee pot and boiling water fast 
Work great with gasoline or white gas cools off fairly quickly small and light weight Great for backpacking and camping 
It is great and made here in the USA by Americans not by the Chinese who makes everything now I checked my clothes I am wearing and there is nothing made here I said well my Thom McMAn shoes were made here for sure but in looking at the label it said made in China There is one thing for sure though i wasnt made in China 
the best multifuel lantern on the market easy to get going  The fuel tank full had lasted for 8 hrs  
I purchased this for my Dad and then got one for myself he owns the 1964 red version which still works but wanted to retire it in his workshop Very Bright and a True WorkHorse even in high winds and damp conditions 
Gave this as a gift and he LOVED it It can be used for camping or at home this was the perfect gift 
this pump is powerful and inexpensive with double action inflation on pressing and lifting the lever Great for topping off the watercraft or inflatable mattress to reach maximum air pressure 
I was looking for something to fill my swiss balls which came with the little hand pumps I first tried an adapter for my little compressor the type plugged into a cars outlet That didnt work The Coleman dual action pump work spendlidy It pumps air on both the upward and downward strokes of the handle filling the ball quite rapidly I couldnt be more pleased with this thing 
This is a decent pump I bought this to blow up an air mattress while camping Its nice because it doesnt require batteries and it does the job fairly quickly Its easy to pack and has adapters to use with about any type of inflatable you could possibly have It does take a fair bit of work If you arent up for a bit of exercise buy an electric If you are OK with some effort and have no access to services where you are using it this is a great fit 
These were add on items and they look fantastic These are great and durable and I recommend them 
Perfect size but the handle is coming off at the top 
Good quality and durable Used these mugs on several camping trips and never get banged up 
Both my sons are campers and they love Coleman so I got them new lanterns Nice quality and easy to use 
What can I say the item seems made well and seems to function properly I will get some use out of it and if I have any problems I will update my review 
My grandfather and father used similar Colemans Now Im starting a family and I bought mine to carry on the tradition Reading reviews it seemed that this was one of the few products which survived globalization and is still the icon of durability and value it once was When mine arrived it was familiar heavy sturdy yet also improved and still made in USA in this case stamped on the bottom Wichita Kansas USA UPDATE Been using the lantern for a few months a few nights a week while Im out in the backyardshed where I have no electricity Lights with the first match and runs for a couple hours on 23 a tank of unleaded gas No detectible odor from using auto gas and no clogging of the generator yet The warm yellow light hiss and warmth are nice aspects of running a lantern instead of a flashlight 
Easy to use Sturdy construction Cooks FAST Being able to use gasoline is a nice option not recommended Comes with a nice filter funnel which is a must One complaint is that the low setting is more like thermonuclear blast High is even hotter Youre not cooking pancakes on this but it will boil liquids in a jiffy It would be nice if it came with a cap or something sturdy to put over the top to protect the fins if backpacking You have to be careful when packing it that they dont get bent Other than that I love this little thing It is well made 
Gets hotter than a liberal about gun control Top aluminum rests are rather cheesy and bend both ways like a RINO Republican While it is not as well made as my old 502 it gets the job done Unlike our current politicos 
Solid Coleman quality here Great for heating food andor water fast Although I havent used it with regular gasoline that is a good option just in case I use white gas that has a much longer shelf life 
There very flimsy and poorly made Im almost scared to actually use it It would work in a pinch  emergency situation then just leave it 
Handling this Old Standard brought back lots of memories The design has not changed in over 50 years 
They work well Ive used them twice now The material is very thin and so it dents easily The handle for the pot is really sharp 
came in handy lightweight worked well love how it fits into one piece 
very cheaply made but maybe its that way to save weight 
Exactly what I wanted a lightweight low heat cooking kit I live in the Florida panhandle and survived over a dozen hurricanes This kit is perfect for use with stereo allowing you to cook the first day or two after that an outdoor grill can be used Great price for all that you get 
Tube tends to kink especially in cooler weather Fortunately it is a standard ID so we could buy a much higher quality and longer braided hose at our local hardware store 
This is a great addition to the Coleman portable hot water heater I did change the hose to a longer length so I can get the shower farther away from the camp site and water runoff when taking a shower Its easier to change hose at the heater than move the whole heater All in all it works fine 
It is all plastic it is not fun to play around itI do not know how people handle it I bought this from warehouse deal and I thought this as a bike pump but not It is only for airbed I am sorry to give a one star you may try it I may get a bad one because it is an open item 
Great for camping 
A classic Just dont drop it I did and mine chipped Rust loves the metal under the enamel downside Coffee goes in the cup and then the cup becomes blazing Upside after about 23 minutes The once hot cup is warm to slightly cool 
I just got my mug yes another way to hold liquid and sometimes a meal I actually use mine for holding water to brush my teeth Great job Great mug Now u want to spend 25  49 for a nice coffee mug Dont buy this But if u want something for camping or a mug you lose and dont have to cry about get this one I gave a 4 out of 5 cuz I had to file down a small bur inside the handle Thats all I would buy it again 
solid cup 
Works perfect very happy with this product Coleman always puts out quality items what more can I say Cant wait to camp 
I grew up camping with Coleman white gas stoves and have used them for nearly 50 years The 533 is constructed and operated basically the same as one I have that was made in 1947 I had a 533 for a few years and ran it on unleaded just to see how it would do Like others have found the generator clogged repeatedly Easy to clean but I dont want to have to take something apart in the field when its 30 degrees outside while I really want a cup of coffee It did work great when it was working though  When I was younger I didnt mind the fiddling thats always required to get a gasoline Coleman stove running just part of the camping ritual Id enjoyed my whole life However my experience with the 533 literally left me cold a couple of times I spoke to the owner of a local Coleman repair station who told me that if I wanted reliability I should stick with stoveslanterns painted red or green in other words older models and follow basic maintenance procedures for them In his experience even those running the dualfuel models on Coleman fuel experienced less overall reliability than older models in good condition  While I still enjoy firing up my old gasoline Colemans once in a while I dont recommend any type especially not the 533 to those who desire a hasslefree camp stove Bring a backup cooking option if you can  Coleman makes a great singleburner propane camp stove Model No 2000004125 that Ive been using regularly for several years now It beats the 533 in so many categories that it would take too long to list them in a short review here 
love it It gets Hot It took me a few times to get the lighting procedure correct an achieve the blue flame If I would have read the directions first it would not have been a problem It comes with a funnel 
It needs a little help from a firestarting paste if its cold out Other than that it works great I use it mostly to heat things up while ice fishing so dont forget to get some firepaste as well 
Good Stuff 
Worth every penny Does not leak Hose could be a little longer but you can order some inexpensively 
its OK but its kind of cheesy and doesnt have a on off switch for conserving water as you lather up 
Worked like a charm Used it for 2 people for 5 days and had people left over 
If people want to spend a lot of money for a power pump more power to them This works great and its not that difficult if youre willing to do a little work Blowing up our 2 twin Coleman mattresses took a mere 78 minutes total Id suggest doing this earlier before its dark for 2 reasons  youll want to be able to see the valve and having a 2nd person helps keep the adapter in the valve 2nd youll probably keep your neighbors up if you do this at night  the pump is sort of loud but not anymore annoying than the electric pumps Id recommend this to anyone for 13 you cant beat it and you dont have to worry about having a plugin or a long enough cord to plug it in 
I broke a long lasting double pump right before a camping trip and desperately went in search of a new one to replace it I was hoping to luck out and find one that worked as well as the old broken pump we replaced What I got was a pump that was better in most every way It definitely moves a lot more air and I as others have stated can routinely beat a portable battery power pump with this one From air mattresses to pool toys this pump has become my first choice It also almost as quickly can remove air from said mattress when Im trying to get it flat to put back in the box Why not 5 stars then There are some down sides I broke off the attached tips within 5 minutes to trying to change one out a zip tie will put them back on I just havent done it it And the biggest issue is hose attaches to the handle on the pump instead of to the base This means the hose moves up and down with me as I pump I occasional pull the end out of what ever Im trying to inflate and find the hose tends to get in my way as its moving up and down with me Still based on the price and the way it works Im more than happy with the purchase I can easily recommend this and would have no problem buying it again 
I have a inflatable thats used for swimming and it was too difficult to use a balloon pump to inflate it After buying this particular hand pump my jobs turned out to be much easier This one is wellbuilt and is made of high quality materials Im surprised at this low price Go for it without a second thought 
I remember my dads old green coleman lantern growing up camping and notice that he still has and uses it Im almost 38 now and I have cheaped out by buying one of colmans propane lanterns a few years agoIt stopped working last year and nothing I tried could make the piece of junk work anymore so I trashed it In need of a lantern I camp often I looked around and noticed these little dualfuel models made just like my old mans but with the ability to burn unleaded gas It seemed a little pricey to me but Amazon had them for 20 less than say Wallyworld so I decided to order one from hereYou get what you pay for and this is no exception Great lantern for car camping Burns all night on less than one tank of fuel and very bright I use the white gas colman fuel but its nice to know that I have another option for fuel if I run out Might want to get a case to protect your investment in this as well Dont cheap out on those propane lanterns get this or the larger model lanterns and your future grand kids might end up with one when they have kids 
I have a smaller back packing lantern from Coleman so I decided to by the larger one I was not disappointed since it is a dual fuel I am not dependent upon buying only white gas for it As usual great service from Amazon 
I am a big fan of Coleman Camping gear in general and this is one excellent piece of gear to own This lantern will burn on regular gasoline as well as the more expensive Coleman white gas I just use regular gas in it and it works great I have had no problems burning regular gas in it like some other folks have but I do make sure to burn each tank out completely before putting it in storage for any amount of time With the lower quality of gasoline in general this is what causes problems for folks that use regular gasit degrades pretty quickly If you are going to put it in storage with fuel in it use only the Coleman white gasit doesnt go bad the way car fuel does Keep a few extra mantles on hand and you are set for when the power goes out 
Look kind of cheap but u pay for what you get in life Is not bad just use couple of times and kick it in the garbage 
I mean its not gone Chinabut it works great for a bug out bag 
This is the OG cookware of camp If you are getting into camping and hiking please buy this before dropping money on a bunch of stuff you never end up using anyways Buy some cheap flimsy metal silverware and bend them to fit inside and you will have the real deal 
Great mess kit for Boy Scouts or campers Use less plastic and paper 
Took this little stove camping into the wilderness of AZ and found it to be a very useful tool I used it mostly for heating water since most of our meals were dried For sure something that will never be left at home on future campinghiking trips 
This is the second Coleman stove I own and not because the first one got damaged The original is still in so good shape and working that I purchased this one for my 14 year old son who now goes backpacking as I did when I was his age This stove has proven operation above 14000 feet above sea level in the Andean range I have only used it with white gas never unleaded If you want a product that will last like few these days this is it No matter if you do not use it frequently it simply works the minute you need it 
We use it camping Works everytime for us We fryed eggs and sausage potato on it One temp high and hot I just pull the cast iron off it when things get to hot then put it back on the heat Id buy again I use it alot 
Ive had mine for several years It is by far the stingiest camp stove Ive ever owned when it comes to fuel use I fried up a cast iron skillet full of a favorite potato dish I like to make when camping  the stove might have used a halfounce of fuel start to finish My Esbit alcohol burner would use 5 times that much fuel at least and doesnt put out near as much heat I have an older twoburner Coleman camp stove that a friend gave me over 25 years ago The only thing it has going for it over this one is two burners  that and a wide stable base and builtin wind screens on the sides But for a night or two in the tent or leanto with just one or two to cook for this little stove with its tank full of fuel is more than enough No need to pack extra gas  a full tank will likely last you all season I havent used gasoline in mine I have a couple gallons of Coleman fuel on hand for my lanterns and the 2burner stove but its nice to know that it will burn regular unleaded gas if need be 
What can I say Its a shower head that works well 
Would work if my HWOD worked Done with Coleman Find another brand 
This accessory is a must have for taking a nice shower outdoors and bathing your pets this accessory works well with the Coleman hot water heater When you need a shower in the wilderness dont leave home with out it 
I bought two of these and they both worked great I do wish the head could be easier to raise and lower but overall Im completely satisfied 
its a really solidly made stove i used at the minute i got it and everything worked like a charm I love it 
The same Coleman sold for many years with a small change in the generator tube that vaporizes fuel Designed to not corrode or plug up the way the old ones did with pump gas The stove works great as always just nice to be able to use pump gas if you run out or in an emergency 
Great 
Thank you these mess Kit is Perfect anyone at any age 
Havent used it yer but seems good 
Basic set and woks great 
everything sticks to it but its light weight and sturdy as hell with together by pack is 100 lbs and it gets dropped and kicked around with these on the outside still holding up i suppose the only reason for 3 stars is because its just cheap materials but hey it works 
Coleman camping equipment has been a staple in our family for over 40 years So there was no question what we were going to buy when we decided to purchase new lanterns Our initial thoughts when our new lanterns arrived was that Coleman products had not diminished in quality over all these year Those primary thoughts were confirmed with the first test lighting of the 285700 lanterns Each primed easily each lit with easy each gave off more than sufficient light for reading under the darkest conditions As with every other Coleman product we own we know these lights will give years of service whether we are hunting fishing or need the light in an emergency situation I am particularly happy that no longer will we have to stock propane canisters but have the ability of using either the old standby white gas or if the need arises the lowest grade of unleaded gasoline I am equally impressed that the burning time for the liquid fuel will be around 10 hours set at medium intensity which is considerably greater than one could ever hope for from a propane canister Some may find that needing to pressurize the fuel tank and keeping it pressurized on these lanterns is a hassle but for me it is nothing short of a throwback to the good ol days when as a small lad Dad took me fishing or when the family spent a week camping Who says you cant go back 
I cannot recommend this lantern more strongly than other products in this space The propane lanterns are a postsale continuing revenue stream for the manufacturer to the detriment of a camper looking for convenientlyaccessible fuel In other words those lanterns benefit the manufacturer by continuing sales of propane tanks that are nonrecyclable and nonrefillable This lantern works extremely well Gasoline is a convenient fuel but people have encouraged me to use the white gas Its durable and does not spill fuel if it is knocked over The propane lanterns are frequently knocked over because they stand so tall The center of gravity of this lantern is much lower thanks to the density of the fuel It can be difficult to light without long matches I remedy that by removing the glass globe and top lighting then replacing the globe etc This doesnt work so well in windy conditions however 
This lantern runs of the Coleman camping fuel or unleaded hence dual fuel so hopefully you never run out of fuel for it Fuel seems to last an insanely long amount of time The mantels burn brightly and are easy to change if needed Only downside is it does need a pretty long lighter or match to light 
Works great just like the propane lanterns Saves on propane tanks uses gasoline Bright I highly recomend this lantern to everyone Much brighter than the electric battery lanterns 
I am so glad I saved the 30 bucks and went with this lantern over the more expensive 1000 lumen version I almost think the 1000 lumens would be overkill now Works exactly as it should casts great light and the dual fuel means we can use the Coleman fuel with it which lasts so much longer than propane lanterns which saves us money 
This is a sturdy little lantern that produces a lot of light Produces 861 lumens on high It use 2 coleman mantle 21easily availableUses coleman fuel or gasolineneeds about 2025 pump strokes at the beginning and runs for a long time Does not need frequent pumping in between Heating up the generator prior to lighting up the mantle prevents the flaring of the lantern at startup The lamp gets quite hot so caution is advised A reflectornot included can be used with the lantern to direct the light where you want to and inhibits the light shining into your eyesmakes a slight hissing noise but not a big deal An economical alternative to propane and expensive battery consuming led lanterns Simple yet effective 
My parents had an old Coleman Pump lantern As I remember it had only a single mantle and didnt give off a very brilliant light and being a youngster I always considered it a REAL PAIN to pump up the pressureand that was usually my assigned duty I did it though but when I got older and had my own family I bought a propane lanternthe Coleman NorthStar It was great but now that I am really really old I hate carting around those expensive metal propane bottles that are ALWAYS in the way I dont know why but I was attracted to this Coleman double mantle dual fuel model lantern Quickly adding up the cost of gas these days and comparing that against the cost of the 164 oz propane bottles I decided that pumping wasnt all that difficult after all and I seem to have a lot more time to do that than I used to have as a kid In my area unleaded regular gasoline is about one tenth the cost of an equivalent amount of bottled propane Please dont yell at me and call me cheapIm just more conservative now hate to give up a penny I dont have to The lantern works perfectly the light is very bright and can be adjusted down to gently subtle One tankful of gasoline lasts about two long evenings and the pump even gives me a little exercise Get oneyoull enjoy it and throw away the propane guzzler I also mothballed my propane twoburner stove and went for the Coleman twoburner dual fuel stove WITH A PUMP 
I cant believe how many reviewers complain about the amount of effort it takes to inflate an air mattress with this pump Lets face it Americans are getting soft This pump is optimally designed with a bore of about 3 12 and a stroke of 12 which combine to create about the right amount of air moved per stroke and input of muscular effort It takes about five minutes to air up a twin size 8 thick air mattress The pump is all plastic but is sturdy enough and is a heck of a value for the price One word of advice sit down while pumping contrary to the picture on the box As far as valve adapters the pump comes with four adapters including a boston valve adapter which is an industry standard Blame the other air mattress manufacturers if they have some weird proprietary valve 
Last year we were caught in a camping situation where we had no electricity and no way other than taking turns blowing up an air mattress by hand like you would a balloon What a job Well this year before our primitive camping trip we looked into finding a hand pump to save our breath LOL I came across the Coleman Large Dual Action Hand Pump during my research for a pump that was specifically designed to work for our air mattress Thank you for such a fine product It worked great and is even equipped with different tips to fit different types of air mattresses openings We will not go camping without it again 
This is a handy stove to have for power outages or car camping Youll find the 21 mantles nearly everywhere A bonus is the dualfuel capability although if youre smart youll use Coleman fuel unless you are forced into a situation where you have to use regular unleaded gasoline dont use premium gas You can switch this lantern over to a regular naphtha lantern by using an alternative generator if desired This dualfuel unit is a good match for the Coleman dualfuel Sportster 533  between the two youll not only be covered for lighting and cooking but also colorcoordinated if youre a lumberjack and youre OK  
I Purchased this gasoline  whitegas fueled lantern last month This item uses gas from YOUR vehicles tank Get a 3 hose and squeeze pump from hardware stores I always have gasoline in my truck when I go camping but get frustrated of storing and looking for whitegas The Lantern puts out the same power and sound as a propanepowered Lantern It uses the same mantles too And NO There is no gas smell 
As everybody else says lengthen the hose and you wont be disappointed As is this is good for hosing down dishes and dirty feet but little else With a longer hose you can easily shower is comfort I bought an extra not knowing the item I won on eBay included one from the seller Its all good 
The tubing is very stiff Almost to the point of being unusable You might be able to tear it apart and substitute better tubing if youre handy 
First of all youre only buying this if you have a Coleman HWOD and if so this is your only option So its not like you can compare Amazon as usual had the best price It plugs into the faucet of your HWOD so you can take a shower or rinse things off You just push the one end into the end of the HWOD theres supposed to be a springloaded clip to hold it in place However the second time I went to use it the clip was missing I havent found it yet The good news is that the HWOD doesnt generate much water pressure so the hose stays connected without the clip 
Very handy spray attachment for taking warm to hot showers while camping or washing dishes Well worth the price of this accessory for the Coleman Instant Hot Water Heater 
the hose could be longer but this product performed wonderfully on my latest camping trip The hose could be longer and more flexible but works as advertised 
Good set for backpacking 
Very thin material makes me nervous that this is aluminum and can be scraped by steel utensils very easily not good to eat aluminum 
Bought this for camping and emergency use Light weight and convenient Goes well with the Sterno stove 
I bet the dimensions are given in the description Theyre so tricky with their pictures And the reviews are so high Youre not cooking anything with these There is no dish in which you could cook even a single portion of ramen soup Theres no dish what you can use to heat up water for coffee or anything you might be able to make one small pancake at a time They foldup conveniently and I suppose for emergency camping they might be fun to use but for my purposes theyre not very realistic for cooking anything 
Just as I remembered them from my childhood I used this on a week long ride from WI to MT and it worked just as I remembered it 
For the price its good but not for hard use 
Hey it a cup Ill update my review in a year or two after I see how they hold up 
Good mug got it for an extended backpacking trip Its just the right size for travel the only problem is a piece of the enamel broke off around the rim of the mug But I dont regret spending 381 on it either 
Been testingbreakingin the unit for a day now Been using BP premium unleaded gasoline since Coleman fuel is so expensive Stove lit up on first try I boiled five cups of water in 5 minutes and boiled 1 12 quarts of water in 15 minutes Using gas did not make any fowl odors and strange burning I believe the reviews that using unleaded gas will lead to a clogged generator so I will purchase a few of those and keep them on hand Seems to be a good purchase and with a five year warranty I have no concerns about quality or being ripped off 
A friend of mine sold me on this and I had one for years The thing I could not get over was the fuel I hated carrying around a container of gas everywhere I was needlessly worried that I would spill gasoline on something and set things afire but the feeling would not go away I hated filling it in the field All that aside these are GREAT stoves They are hot burning and do the best job Almost like having your homestove with you I recommend that you get the case to pack it in which adds some weight but make sure you pack it upright as much as possible I never had any leaks but Ive heard stories of the whitegas stoves leaking all over packs Thankfully it evaporates quickly but then it all smells All in all a great stove 
Wanted one of theze for YEARS  power went out AGAIN  so i ordered stove and some LED lights  filled fuel  lit  let warm up and boiled me a pot of garden veggies in italian dressing fer lunch  GOOD STUFF   the flame controls better than i thought it would  As with ALL coleman fueled stoves  give it time to warm up and an excellent stabile flame will be there  very satisfied  will be trying unleaded fuel later  well  until the nekst power out  
Nice and compact I havent used them yet but they seem sturdy 
VERY TINY 
as described 
This is just the way I remember them but a little thinner Not too bad 
get what you pay for 
Bought for two grandsons new to camping What can I say They cooking pans 
Its a piece of junk 
Got tired of these batteryoperated pumps that would inflate air beds with below average pressure This one does the work with flying stars inflates both ways pulling up or pushing down so none of your energy goes to waste and does it fast  Highly recommend 
This pump works great for filling up large things like pool inflatable and air mattresses very quickly and just as fast to deflate I bought it to back up my batterypowered inflatable camping mattresses but use it regularly for tubes Love it 
This is a 700 pump I bought to inflate small items e g SwissStability Balls Pool Floats Inner Tubes etc The pump does a Good job with these and similar items I WOULD NOT recommend this pump for camping trips large air mattressesbicycle tires etc It comes with a nice selection of nozzles It IS ALL PLASTIC and the connecting hose is fairly delicate lightweight plastic and would break or rupture easily if not handled carefully I would not recommend carrying this pump around in the trunk of a car behind a truck seat etc This pump also requires a good bit upperbody STRENGTH inflating a large airbed or similar item would be fairly difficult for a manwoman of lessthan average physical strength This seems true for both INFLATEDEFLATE functions Again a good functional pump for SportsFitness Ballsetc 
Its light and easy to use And it works just fine Ive used it for balloons fast and simple and for a large ball for my horse and it works just great to fill it up to its 40 size The attachments are great Good variety Id recommend this to anyone whos got something simple to inflate 
Product has worked great so far However the adapters supplied did not connect with my fishing float tube I had to find a piece of flexible plastic tubing from the hardware store to act as a connector between the valve on my float tube and the adaptors on the pump I am not sure if that is how it is meant to be used but it works great No instructions were supplied with either the float tube or the pump on how to make the connection for this application I do not know how long this pump will last but it works great on both the up stroke and down stroke once I found a way to connect them Fills and empties my fishing float tube in just a minute or two 
I thought perhaps this may be a little small for my needs but I was wrong Dont let the compact size fool you this stove puts out a nice greenblue flame like a little jet engine Cant wait to take it fishing on the ice tomorrowHot soupWooo Hooo  Thank you Coleman for yet another great product And as always Thank you to Amazon for providing great products all around Rick B in Wisconsin 
We have used several hundred of these stoves for over 25 years in our canoe trip ourfitting business here in the Boundary Waters of Ely Minnesota They produce good heat and have a solid base for large pots If given reasonable care they perform well and last a long time If not packed correctly in packs however the four aluminum vanes in the burner area will bend and expose the brass generator tube The next thing that may happen is a fuel leak During a recent forest fire we supplied 30 of these stoves to US Forest Service Hotshot Crews Since these elite firefighters know how to care for equipment not one problem was reported over several weeks of daily use Coleman used to include a lightweight plastic case for packing the stoves but no longer do that A cost cutting mistake in our estimation Overall it is a great product if not treated as a rental 
Ive owned a few of these not because they broke but because I either lost or sold them the burner is plenty powerful for just about any cooking needs and I even usually use it to cook in the house because it is so much better than the house stove it may seem expensive but the versatility fuel wise and shear power and controllability of the flame make it useful even around the house 
Used this a lot while camping only thing is it is very hard to clean once used Other than that it works great 
good for a kids first mess kit 
Great product Thank you 
OK stocking stuffer 
Larger than expected 
Definitely nothing fancy Compact and light but scratches very easily thats aluminum for you and can be hard to put back together at times Food tends to stick to it as it lacks any nonstick surface 
just as described very nice product great kit for back packing light holds up well 
cool 
Inflated a king mattress in a couple of minutes My 6 year old has no problems using this 


Ok not sure about all the 4  5 star ratings on this product Ive owned both the Coleman model 533 and the model 553 its big brother and neither are impressive They lack fine midrange temperature control versus the Feather 400 model are quite temperamental to coldstarts unless on high and kept on high during the cook The smaller tank on the 533 model means more frequent inmeal pumping of the fuel tank and dont dare DREAM of burning gasoline in the stove regardless what the sales marketing says  because there are NUMEROUS COLEMAN WARNINGS inside the box of what it will do to your stove and its generatorthey REALLY dont want you burning unleaded gasoline in their multifuel stove hey Coleman dont make sure a big deal out of it in the box paperwork if you are going to sell it as an intentional dualfuel stove in the marketing phase ok Overall it is dependable to fire and burn but hey so are a few sticks of wood  and it is about as controllable for a fire as two sticks burning It is what it is cheap You can do better with an Optimus or MSR allfuel stove Why dont you check them out first most of them pack smaller burn better and are built MUCH betterand if you get their multifuels they dont warn you to death not to burn multifuels in it they merely tell you how to properly service it after you have What a concept Coleman products have become a money grabbing poorquality fiasco in modern times I do not recommend the 533 or the 553 stoves as a result of this showing in both products 
This is a compact little stove It is very efficient The control valve is precise I ordered a case for this stove from coleman for 8 which was not available here on amazon Nice sturdy product 

This is a great little stove I have 2 they make a great accessory to the 2 the burner stoves 425 or 413 While car camping I can make coffee on this 533 while the rest of breakfast cooks on the 2 burner one I have never cooked food with Regular Unleaded Gas RUG but I have used one of these stoves with RUG to melt wax for making candles it seemed to burn just as well as the camp fuel aka white gas  This stove cranks out a lot of heat on high too much really for the smaller pots that will fit on this stove So I use it on medium to low mostly Since this is a single burner it probably isnt to wise to use a big pot and have it tip over I rigged up a home made device from an old barbeque grate to hold larger pots but it is not foldable I wish Coleman would design and make an accessory stand or stove grate for the Sportster II with collapsible legs that the stove could be placed under and a larger pot safely on top Hey Coleman I would be willing to test market such a device This is a great stove not quite as well made as the old 502s but still very good I have had one since 99 and the other since 05 w no problems and use them frequently It is indeed a bit tricky to get this stove to simmer and it doesnt simmer very well but it will simmer Trick is is to get it hot first then turn it down to a simmer the generator tube across burner must be hot to vaporize the liquid If the simmer does start to go out remove the pot turn it back to high for minute or so and then back down to simmer and repalce the pot or pan BTW if using unleaded gas in this or any Coleman Dual Fuel appliance use regular 87 octane or less bc it has less addidtives than premium or super grade gasoline Also buy the gasoline from generic stations that dont offer the additive packages like the name brand stations Youre operating a stove not a car Think about it Coleman fuel aka white gas is basiacly a pure unleaded gasoline naptha with out all the additives designed for automotove gasoline These additives are what plug up the generators so the less additives the better Coleman fuel only has an octane rating of 55 there is no need to use high octane gas Besides do you really want to cook food with fuel that has more toxic chemicals than needed Some reviewers that gave this stove low marks said they used 93 high octane and then complained when it clogged up If the generator does clog it can be user serviced and cleaned or new ones are of course available Its your choice 
Pros 1 They hold water and do not appear to leak Perfect for cooking small outdoor meals Cons 1 The cup is practically useless for hot liquids Because it is made of aluminum and is rather thin the handle get crazy hot if you use it for coffee or other hot liquids 2 When closed up they are not very tightly secured If shaken or dropped the whole mess kit could loose 3 Secured with a bolt and wingnut Easy to loose either It would be better if the bold was permanently attached to one side then you only have the wingnut to lose 4 Some of the edges are sharp Might be good to hit it with a little sand paper or a file to reduce the risk of cutting yourself 
thses seems a bit flimsy but cant wait to test them pit on our next camping 
What you see is what you get Light portable thinner cook wear I got it for my BOBINCH bag I hear you need oil or far or things stick Like all aluminum you shouldnt cook acidic foods like pineapple or things like that since it will eat away at your pans WarningDont use every day and try not to scratch the cook wear Aluminum is linked to Alzheimers and other bad things I plan on using this once in a blue moon or in a disaster situation where i will die if i dont use anything For once in awhile use it is compact light weight cook wear Just remember you were warned 
After having this stove for a while now i decided to rewrite the review to better reflect my experiences with it After initially testing it I gave it 5 stars and updated the review to reflect that I had not experienced any problems with clogging after running over 5 gallons of gasoline through it to date i have never run this on anything other than unleaded gas and it still runs just fine Now if I could give it 10 stars I would This summer on a trip to horn island 7 miles south of pascagoula ms in the Gulf of Mexico my kayak partially sunk and i capsized i floated 6 miles back to shore on the incoming tide tethered to my partially sunken kayak when i washed up i pulled this little guy out of the flooded hatch and set it out to dry this was about 4am by the time the sun came up it lit right up and produced a warm roaring flame its a little rusty now and the pump is a bit stiff but you cant argue with bullet proof reliability like that i will say that it will run much better on 93 octane than it will on 87 and given the minuscule amount of gasoline it uses the cost difference is negligible avoid ethanol if you can it will burn better without it 
I bought this to use indoors when I visit friends and just need a lightweight bag to sleep in Its a lot easier than carting sheets and more comfortable I was perfectly warm but not overly so in it If the house didnt have regulated heatair I could have commented on its warmthlack thereof As it was the environment was normal and the bag was perfect for my needs It comes in a stuff bag that is really small and I thought Id have a hard time reinserting it but it worked fine Recommended  
This item added and extra 10 degrees to my sons sleeping bags wo a great addition of weight They have also slept w just the liner and been plenty warm It is a good addition to your back packing and camping supplies The item fits easily into the compression sack and packs small 
Good quality and great price 
Small and arrived broken but its fine 
Not that workouts are bad but I didnt think Id have to exert as much energy as I did in using this pump I ordered it to inflate an air mattress that Ive been using since I moved and it came quite in handy I had the mattress fully inflated in about five minutes I thought it would pump air in faster but it was still certainly faster than if I had done it myself It does however take a little bit of force to get it going I knew there would be some resistance and Im no small fry but it needs a little bit of getting used to Other than that it comes with a set of adapters that are all attached at the end of the tube which makes it convenient so you can test out the correct size right away Very convenient and very portable 
This Coleman hand pump is really the ticket if you need one to easily inflate or add air to an existing inflated air mattress without taking it back to your vehicle to use your 12v air pump It was easy to use even for an older person and did the job in short order It is perfect to take with you if you will be camping for a long time in one spot when your air mattress could lose a little air with just sleeping on it for several nights You cant go wrong for 1095 for something so efficient so I highly recommend this product Amazon shipped it quickly as well and it was priced better and no taxes either than getting it from my local Walmart Enjoy 
This pump is very robust but what a work out for me as an adult male with descent strength I swear you need to be a body builder or an athlete with thick arm to pump at a fast pace Queen size bed can take 15  20 minutes with a breather every couple of minutes This despite its dual action Trying to pump 3 air mattresses for camping definitely can burn enough calories to eat a bag of chips 
I bought this to be used with Coleman singlesize air mattresses and I have to say it gave my armsshouldersback quite the workout It takes a good amount of time pumping up and down up and down to get even a singlesize air mattress inflated Pros  No need to worry about finding power  batteries  Never worry about a flat battery in an electric pump  Sturdy construction  Variety of connectors for different valves included  Great workout for the upper body  Cons  Can be tiring to inflate two mattresses in a row  Takes quite a bit of time  effort to inflate even a singlesize air mattress  Pump is quite large and cumbersome I dont regret buying this over the more expensive electric pumps and I expect that it would last much longer too Hopefully it would work with other brands of air mattresses too  I havent had the chance to try that This pump apparently also allows you to suck air OUT of the air mattress allowing the mattress to be thoroughly deflated and be as compact as possible 
Good set for the price I use most of the pieces as lightweight campingbackpacking dishes Works great for that 
Good 
Very practical and convenient to use and to clean It is just sufficient for 1 to 2 persons depending on what you cook Family cooking should get 2 or look for bigger set 
Bought this for my son he is a Boy Scout They want camping and the mess kit worked great They are a lot lighter and flimsy than what I had as a kid but work the same 
I am a stove collector as well as a car camper I have many stoves and use them all on occasion I almost always bring the 533 along because it just works well It burns hot with Coleman fuel but I usually dont actually cook on it I boil water on it The simmer function is marginal until it heats up and can sustain low fuel flow and vaporize it effectively As for those of you who chose to use unleaded fuel and clogged your generator tubes please send them to me I will pay the postage As soon as I take them apart soak them in carburator cleaner and flush them clean I will sell them back to you  For those of you who want to backpack this stove is probably a bit heavy Check out an MSR or an antique Svea 123 but be ready for sticker shock 
I needed a one burner stove for car camping and debated on this liquid fuel stove versus the Coleman propane single burner Ended up buying both stoves just to test them out Im very impressed with the Sportster stove and it will be my choice for car camping Convenient to operate warms up quickly with a minimum of flaming runs very hot compared to propane and simmers reasonably well Thee have been reports of problems getting it to simmer but it simmered well for me after some experimentation I think the secret is using reasonably fresh Coleman fuel less than a year old but mainly try approaching the simmer setting from the the OFF direction and not from the full on direction Hard to explain but when you turn the control lever fully to off and quickly back to on it will simmer very stably but will flame out if you approach simmer from the full on direction Bottom line a good price from Amazon and no disappointments with this stove 
I plan on going MotorcycleAirplane camping throughout this summer and purchased this stove about 4 months ago to prepare for the trip Ive tested it multiple times and LOVE it Works on unleaded gas and Coleman fuel as promised refuse to test leaded aviation gas in it though I like this stove so much that I actually stick to the Coleman fuel unless unleaded is all I have as I hear from other reviewers that the unleaded gas isnt good for the stove Doesnt matter as one tank can probably get you through a weekend This thing burns HOT but takes a minute or two to allow the generator to heat up or else it tends to flare up not a big issue IMHO This stove may be heavy for backpackers but for the motorized camper who still needs to worry about size its PERFECT BTW I own the 533 model of this stove from Walmart 
I had to use gasoline in this in a pinch and the generator got plugged up I just purchased this and they are discontinued and they no longer sell the generator for this model BS if you ask me Of course it is past the return period so I am stuck with a useless pos for 50 I could have just made a penny stove out of cans and had the same result only difference is the penny stove would still be working Boo Coleman 
I purchased this little Coleman 533 one burner Dual Fuel stove mostly for emergengy use I read a lot of the reviews on it and based on the reviews the Coleman reputation for relibility and longevity and the 533 stoves small size I was sold Back in December 2007 we had an ice storm and lost all power for nine days No power and No heat I like the idea of Dual Fuel but will probably use Coleman fuel most of the time if it is on hand My Chevy truck has a 35 gallon fuel tank so we should always have access to unleaded gas if necessary Now we will be prepared to boil water or make coffe or tea or cook some dinner during the next emergency Highly recommended 
This single burner Coleman has heat output that rivals a space shuttle launch It will run on coleman fuel or unleaded though coleman generally recommends staying away from unleaded to extend generator life Its conveniently sized but is probably too heavy for camping It does keep a cool fount and the width makes it more stable than hikinsized stoves This stove would be 55 if it simmered better After a few years mine stopped wanting to simmer I suspect I let fuel sit in it for a long time and it gummed up the fa tube I suspect I can replace the fa tube which I think is part of the valve assembly in this model 
This little stove is very strong its like a blowtorch when it on high its pretty compact great for 14 person camping or for a family if you only need one burner i was hesitant to get it because it didnt look stable with those little metal supports and i thought it would scratch the bottom of my cookware but i put my pots and pans from home on it with no shacking or rocking back and forth or scratches It heats up water so fast its surprising every time youll never be waiting for your propane stove to slowly heat up water again Also i recommend using the Coleman fuel yes its 810 per gallon but it burns for longer and cleaner than gasoline although all Ive used so far is Gas and i still love it even with the soot its leaves on the stove and pan when your warming it up 
Perfect for blowing up those inflatable kid toys like rafts balls mattresses Works fine on inflation cells of kitesurfing kite Works fine right out of the box 
I was about to buy one of Colemans battery powered electric pumps for the Coleman queensized airbed Id bought but decided I didnt want to spend the money and the batteries on something that isnt used a whole lot Plus I didnt want to drive my fellow campers crazy with the loud whinning sound of an electric pump This pump is ALL plastic even the handle but it seems pretty sturdy Theres two ports for the hose one on each side of the handle for inflation and deflation The hose has two pins that lock into notches on the ports when you twist the hose on so it wont come off during use The other end of the hose comes with a builtin connector that fits most new Coleman airbeds as well as two tethered adapters for smaller openings The pump is fairly large in capacity Although its only just over a foot tall its about as good as a much larger bicycle pump Still it doesnt take nearly as long as a foot pump to inflate the airbed Deflating does make a bit of a whistle especially at the end but the ability to pull out all the air and get the bed good and flat for rolling is awesome The only thing that could make this pump better is if it came with a bag to put it in to keep it protected and keep everything together Although it is just a cheap pump so no worries If you dont want to get an electric pump for an airbed get this pump Allaround its a good deal 
Poor quality seems to be very flimsy 
light compact great for emergencies 
Cheap thin lightweight aluminum mess kit for backpacking 
Its light and cooks food The end 
Just like the mess kit that I had 55 years ago when I was in Scouts Gift to Grandson 
The 533 continues the long line of dependable Sportster not Sporter Amazon stoves This model can use unleaded gas in addition to white gas Coleman fuel because of the included generator same part as a 433 stove but if you use a 433 generator youll only be able to use white gas I prefer white gas and never got good results with 87 octane too much soot This stove is NOT for backpacking unless your name is Varnell a farm boy from Georgia over six feet tall 230 lbs and can tote an M60 on crossbayou treks with no problem Good stove to keep in the truck or in the cabin Dependable fires up with little problem Easy availability of spare parts Not as sexy as a lightweight titanium butanepropane stove nor as weight efficient as a good commercial or homebrew alcohol stove but gets the job done I have made the mistake of buying and selling a number of these over the years and should have stuck with my old green model  it would still be working today 
This stove is a real powerhouse we use it to boil large pots of crab3 at a time We bring it with us in our westfalia as a third burner or a fast water boiler This stove will not let you down in almost any weather conditions Coleman makes a very solid well made unit that can take a beating and keep on heating This stove can use colemanwhite gas or unleaded fuel Bring one on your next outing and be amazed 
Works well and has survived our boy scouts These are easy to assemble and use and clean up reasonably well I would order this mess kit again 
Junk Chinese made crap The cup doesnt nest properly in the pot The pot doesnt nest properly under the plate The entire unit is one great big manufacturing defect THIS IS IN NO WAY COMPARABLE TO THE BOY SCOUT KITS YOU REMEMBER 
An extremely light product that is very compact and is a great addition for any wilderness adventure My only concern is that given that its made of aluminum how durable it will be when exposed to extremely hot fires 
Good cheap mess set Should last awhile if you take care of it 
Horrible I dont even own this anymore It went bad on the first use and could not use it again afterwards it was so ruined from the first use 
Good set it will warm up your food Its no Paula Dean set but if ya need a Paula Dean set on a survival hike stay out of the woods 
Had a set like this little one years ago and donated it when we upgraded to an enamelware set We decided to get a new set as a backup for quick overnight or weekend hikes and this does the job Its light and easy to use The price was reasonable way under ten bucks so whats not to like 
Easy pump to use for a hand pump The double action inflation works wonders to speed up the time it takes to get that air mattress or inflatable kayak filled to the top Probably takes longer to figure out which air nozzle to use than the actual act of inflating Wish the unit was a little taller so you wouldnt have to hunch over so much but then again the small compact size is also a plus for easy transporation Highly recommend 
Light weight yet durable to pack and take with you Easy to set up and hook up to the bladers Pumps fast and real easy 

The first two we ordered both arrived damaged Amazon was quick to replace them and one of the replacements also was damaged I dont suspect these will last long 
Its a cup It does what cups do Strong durable and will probably outlast me Great for rough environments and easy to clean 
Nice little basic mess kit just like the one I had 20 Years ago Nothing special but serves the purpose 
Great for GHB 
Decent little pan set Very cheap material though slight thicker than aluminum Fast Shipping product arrived on time  undamaged 
Medicore quality we had to replace the screw that holds it all together already Would probl get a sturdier set next time but this works for weekend trips for Boy Scouts 
Buy this if you enjoy some serious exercise cuz this aint no joke The pump is well made and it doesnt take forever to inflate or deflate but after you pump one mattress youll feel like you just ran a quarter mile Overall its a well made product but its somewhat bulky and you have to make sure you dont crack the plastic hose which will make the entire product worthless 
We bought this air pump locally and found it worked well pumping a large volume of air into the little pressin valves However when we went to pump up the hull of our inflatable kayaks we found that the pumps Boston valve adapter is too large in diameter for the values on our Sevylor kayak Since the pump was otherwise good and inexpensive decided to sand down the adapter a little bit Works fine now 
This Coleman pump with dual action is surprisingly well designed We use it for inflatable kayaks and it inflates the kayaks within minutes This is a great item for locations where having electrical pumps is not that feasible and you want to quickly pump an air bladder up Recommended without reservations 
Used it as a sleeping bag liner It added some warmth and the texture was better than the inside of my sleeping bag I tried to pull the tag off and the zipper seam tore So yeahdont do that 
I used this sleeping bag daily in Africa for two months It lasted there and I still use it back home 
This liner works very well 
Nice bag liner to stay warm during freezing cold winter temperatures 
Bought this several years ago for my husband and liked it so much I ordered another one for myself Nice to use when its not cold enough for a warm sleeping bag Very soft and light weight 
I am a Red Cross volunteer and I take this with me to use on the cots to sleep It works perfectly for that but it isnt the best quality The zipper ripped out the first week I used it but I like this concept 
It bends too easily not sturdy 
Will get the job done it was designed for Better to have one and not need it than need one and not have it AND FROM THE LOOKS OF THINGS IT LOOKS LIKE THE LATTER IS NOT THE PLACE YOU WANT TO BE 
Feels like a one time use deal Ill need a trash can at the camp site pro is it weighs nothing lol 
Come onyou know what youre buying here Good if you think youll use the set once and maybe twice If you have kids and they are getting into scouting or just camping in general and you arent 100 confident theyll stick with it these are a good wait and see kit 
As expected great product 
Once assembled none of the other parts fit inside 
I purchased one of these pumps locally as I needed it quickly It was usable but had a leak in the seam of the air hose I took it back to exchange for a nondefective pump making sure to test before I left the store Two more of these pumps also had seam leaks The last one they had in stock was okay The hose is thin hard plastic with a seam running lengthwise I can foresee replacing the hose in the future with something more durable 
Kind of bulky but a large size is necessary to produce such an efficient manual powered air pump It is very light weight and sure to outlast several air mattresses 
Not only does this work beautifully to pump up an air mattress but it fans a dying campfire too Just aim the biggest nozzle at the glowing coals and start pumping Instant flames It takes me only a minute or so to blow up my twinsized thick air mattress My camping buddys batterypowered pump takes three times as long and requires four D batteries Who wants to worry about dead or weak batteries in the middle of the woods If youre looking for an air pump go with this manual one Its fast easy and doesnt cost a dime to operate Let the foolish campers worry about where to plug in their electric pumps or where to buy batteries when the old ones fail UPDATE April 2012 The pump still works as well as the day I bought it It is a vital piece of camping equipment Roughed Extra nozzles are still attached to the hose They cant get lost 
Very well made 
Just a very nice product 
Horrendous dont waste your money Arrived chipped they wouldnt return it washed them this weekend to take to camp anyway and paint is peeling off Into the garbage they go Shouldnt be allowed to even give a star 
Work as intended Ive had pans like these for years A little hint is to keep some oil with you so they dont burn and make cleaning a nightmare 
Smaller than what I anticipated but will be able to use Picture makes it look bigger 
I have had one of these for like 15 years I have beat the hell out of it and burned things in it and forgotten about it and it still has held up I carry it in my backpack and have taken it in my RV and have used it camping backpacking backyard for kids to learn with etc I dont know why people are complaining it is cheap LIGHT and easy You can scrub the crap out of it or drop it no issues Unless you have death paws or acid touch it shouldnt fall apart and I could care less about dents Give me a break Mine still look practically new I have spent more money on one disappointing coffee and lunch If you dont want to fork big bucks for good ones that are expensive and have more features then dont whine about these If you just want BASIC and lightweight and dont expect resort quality cookware then go for it 
Great for camping or an emergency 
looks better in the pics 
Simple basic and it works well for its intended purpose Kind of a pain to clean if you burn something but its not teflon coated For the price itll do the job 
Be sure to check measurements Im cooking for a party of one so i my case it is perfect Very light takes up hardly any room with your gear Think this will work just fine unless the camping party gets larger 
Zipper broke on first use  indoors 
works as advertised 
It arrived I tried to unzip it the zipper WOULD NOT MOVE AN INCH Correction not a millimeter Even had another person try to pull it while I held the bag  nothing Ive never seen anything like it its like the zipper is welded in place Extremely disappointing for a Coleman product was forced to return it immediately 
I bought this so I would have a blanket when I traveled and would be somewhat protected in less than desirable conditions My concerns were to avoid a cheaper one so I would have zipper issues and the construction may be better buying a brand name I have used this several times since my purchase and have been quite happy with it overall If conditions are cold it is not super warm but does keep the chill off by itself May be a bit too hot in summer heat but that remains to be proven yet The portability is great rolls up in small bag Zippers seem like good quality so far I am very happy in what I paid and the quality I received I would recommend this product 
handle securing the parts together is a bit flimsy 
love it 
Very meh The biggest issue I have with this kit is the lightweight construction It just doesnt hold up to regular use Its also bulky so for situations where the light weight would be an asset like backpacking it takes up too much space But if youre using this for car camping then weight isnt much of a concern and you can use more sturdy cooking gear It therefore sits in kind of a weird place and if youre a minimalistspartantype camper youll probably be very frustrated with this item regardless of the type of camping youre doing I mean its made well enough for what it is but pieces are kind of redundant I usually eat from the same vessel I cook in and very lightweight aluminum which scratchesgouges easily if you arent careful So at the end of the day I guess its OK for light camping duties but for anything demanding this kit will rapidly be out of its depth 
Feels slightly flimsy but somewhat solid It was a little smaller than I thought but turned out to be a good thing as it fit in my new Red rock sling pack perfectly Giving it a field test of 3 days camping at lake tenkiller If it ends up being a dud of a product ill update my review but seems to be a good product over all especially for the price 
I like it but just cheap made 
thought they were bigger ok for the price 
These are basic cups Reason for the 3 stars is that when you pour coffee or hot chocolate in the cups the entire cup is burning hot It retains the heat and makes it hard to drink Also they do not clean easily 
What a buy Ice chest looks great Im sure it will hold up to many years of use I purchased this as a Christmas present for my husband He was very happy to receive it We learned all too well after hurricane Katrina that ice just doesnt last in a regular ice chest Hopefully we will be more prepared if ever in that situation again We havent tested it out yet but people I know say that ice will last 3 days in this type ice chest 
I own this cooler circa 1968 It is bombproof and looks like it survived a tour in Vietnam but we haul this bad boy out each summer because it does the job The cam lock on the lid keeps it from flying free if jarred or jostled this is a very good thing if you take it fishing and have your catch inside Construction is good enough to last near 40 years of use before considering a replacement It really will survive that many seasons of use which is more than you can say for many fragile thermoplastic knockoffs There are few camping or summertime essentials that can be universally adopted but the Coleman steel cooler has to be one Bring it on your next outing and even if you have boring cans of Diet Coke inside people will stop to check it out Fred 
Great lightweight cookingeating set Used a similar one for years in scouts and this one is just as good 
flimsy came bent in package does its job 
Great for price 
Aluminum is pretty thin but will last if taken care of 
good 
Good 
Lips were chipped upon arrival But they now have character Will keep them 
My 9 year old daughter slept in this in a hammock when it got in the low 50s outside She said she was perfectly comfortable 
My son and I used these on a recent camping trip as liners in our sleeping bags We were tenting in temps approximately upper 40s These bags gave us both some welcome extra warmth I dont think youd want this alone at 50 deg but maybe around 70 deg it would be ok by itself They pack down reasonably small and while they arent especially lightweight for backpacking they fit our needs just fine for Cub Scout camp The fabric is soft and warm just like your favorite throw blanket at home 
Our family goes camping about once a month and we found we were going through a lot of those little Coleman propane canisters between our stove and lantern We have a big propane grill at the house so it seemed logical to use that same bulk canister to power our camping appliances Very simple to use My only complaint would be the length If it was another 24 taller it would get the lantern up higher to illuminate more of the campsite Otherwise works as advertised 
Light durable affordable Nothing fancy but definitely functional 
Very small Meant for 1 or 2 people if that But it gets the job done 

returnedgood but not for us 
Good starter cook kit 
So this is your basic ultra light cook set Ill go over my perceptions as far as pros and cons below then summarize my overall feeling Pros Super light weight great for backpacking  Each piece serves an essential purpose but you could save more weight by ditching the aluminum cup or one of the larger cookware objects  When all set inside one another and clasped together with the handle of the pan as anticipated by the manufacturer there is no jangling or shaking its a nice secure fit  Heats up quickly and cools quickly  The price Much cheaper than other sets on here Cons  Food does stick As other reviews say use sand or gravel to scrub then rinse with water Good as new  Handle can get hot if left on fire or heat source for a long time  Metal cup can get hot when filled with hot liquids Overall I think this is a great set for its purpose I am not cooking gourmet meals when I camp because Im trying to save weight and time and not bring all kinds of food supplies This set allows one to boil water and fry something simultaneously then have a mess plate to throw your eggs in and a cup to drink the coffee you just boiled in It will serve well for making simple meals and eating them while not taking up space or weight in your backpack It is a no frills set up that will be something you can rely on if you are ok with no frills Cant be beaten for the price 
love it  good condition as showed 
Purchased for camping works great I hook it to my pack and go 
easily chips One was slightly chipped upon receipt but I was going camping so I took them anyway they came individually wrapped still small chip Chipping got worse so I had to trash them Too bad these are super retro and cool looking Dont make em like they used too 
It is aluminum and has a tin pan quality to it but this mess kit does the job and it is excellent as far as Aluminum is an excellent conductor of heat and cold and it literally weighs next to nothing It arrives well packaged and includes a plate cup pot with lid and loop and a 7 inch pan good enough for a small fish bird or squirrel The pot is more than adequate for boiling two cups of water which is 16 ounces which Id good for making pasta or hot cereal or rice for two and with the lid on you can probably bake bread in it on a coal oven like you would with a cast iron pot For the price this cant be beat If it last only a seasons worth of camp cooking that is more than my money back but I have heard and seen reviews where people have used this same mess kit for years 
Remember boy scouts This is what I used and it worked as well now A personal cooking set I really like this product Go Coleman 
Inexpensive and cheap but perfect for a hiking backpack or survival kit to use infrequently I really like the small light weight size and how easy it is to pack and carry Works good to warm food or even cook on a tiny portable stove or small fire but if the aluminum gets too hot it will burn black 

Good kit have cooked a number of times with it not much to say reallyit serves its simple purpose of cooking food or heading up drinks over fire it is aluminum so will bend with force but I just cook and drink with these Im not looking to beat someone over the head with my cookwear lol so is fine by me One nice thing about it be of a lighter of material is its very lightweight Great for when hiking far adds about no weight 
Soft and light weight Perfect for camping in Arizona 
I got this for my dog actually it was already ripped when I got it but what are you gonna do Its cheap and you get what you pay for My main complaint is that it is HUGE There is just no good way to fold this thing up 
This does help when used inside the sleeping bag We camp a lot so I bought couple of these to add into my kids sleeping bags when nights when it get to low 50s at night 
Does its job Very comfortable 
Great extra for any camp out 
Putting it in my 2004 Yamaha 90hp all summer its running well and weve noticed less smoke than before always used YamaLube before this Very happy with this product and Ill order again 
a 
Hard to believe how this all fits as it does Takes up no room in my pack Perfect Obviously these are cheaply made out of very thin aluminum but it is absolutely everything you need for when out in the woods and cooking or heating up your supper on an open flame Small saucer with lid pan with handle small cup with handle and bowlplate Close security with a little nutscrew everything fits inside the platepan is extremely lightweight and had a very small foot print so very easy to toss in a backpack Coleman has been around forever and has always made good quality outdoor products Highly recommend Must have in your backpack 
I just received this mess kit and I know it will come in handy while camping and hiking Included is a frying pan platebowl mini dutch oven a lid and a cup Its lightweight and everything nests together but also the handle goes over the top and is secured with a screw  wing nut so its not only compact  easy to carry all the pieces stay in place If youre wanting Cuisinart quality wrong thing to purchase although it is made by Coleman I cant wait to use mine glad I bought it and as a lightning deal I cant beat the price 
I already had one of these kits and was happy for backpacking use I ordered this one for my son which we havent used yetsoon though 
Light weight mess kit that has the necessary items to prepare a good meal while camping Do recommend 
Good price and product 
I bought a few of these for a 4 day camping trip During this time they took a lot of abuse bouncing around against each other and the enamel help up perfectly They are a nice size for drinks but probably not big enough for soups or other meals For that youll want something bigger Also keep in mind that when using these for hot drinks use the handle as they will get hot themselves 
One of the three I bought came chipped It was fine theyre just for camping but thats enough to lose a single star for me Otherwise theyre exactly what I expected 
cups came chipped and missing blue coating I ordered 6 and two were chipped The others are very poorly made 
ok for the money ok for camping  not quite big enough to boil enough water in a survival situation 
have in pack for emergencies 
havent used it yet but looks fine 
Light weight kind of bendable but I really didnt like the mastitis it was made out of it was very scratchy but other then that it was a great product 
small compact light weight 1 person use does what i need it for 
Ive been testing this out at home Ben slept in over 14 times and washed three times no trouble After I use it over a sleeping bag liner and inside a bivy I expect to buy another Its just what I needed 
Kids love these Worked great for summer camping trip both as a liner for colder nights and independently for the warm nights 
soft and warm 
Nice product but the size is big if youre considering to take it to camping 
As far as I can tell Star Bright Super Premium 2 Cycle Engine Oil is indistinguishable from the brandname motor oil that I had been using that came with a premium price tag I have been using it in my home generator for over a week now with absolutely no problems Obviously this is not a long time to have tested the product but it has been running 247 which is in contrast to most reviews here that have only used the product during intermittent periods 
This is one of the best TCW3 Super Premium 2Cycle Engine Oils available ashless low smoke means a clean running engine that has more power and longevity Protect your investment with Star brite Super Premium 2Cycle Engine Oil Works with all oil Injection systems or self mix with a quality gasoline If youre using a basic 2 cycle motor oil now just give this a try youll soon see the difference and understand why its worth the extra cost Made in the USA 
Ive used this in an old trail and street dirt bike that they dont even make any more and it mixed great I also had some little bottles that were empty and used them as a measuring cup amount to mix with a gallon of gas So the weed eaters and two stroke garden tiller performed great with it also I havent tried it in a chain saw but I suspect the saw would start easier on this type of mixture than regular 2 stroke mixing oil Conventional oil lets out a lot of smoke if you dont get the mixture exactly right Synthetic oil mixture also prevents the spark plug from getting fouled up 
I personally do know much about oil but my husband says this is a premium oil and I will take his word for it according to him it burns clean again I am lost Our jet skis do seem to run better That is amazing plus it is environmentally friendly and offers lubrication that helps to protect even at high stress speeds My husband has found an 2 cycle oil that is worth the money For him that is awesome he is so picky 
I have several things that require 2 cycle engine oil and Ive used this on almost all of them I feel very confident that the engines are burning much cleaner because there is less smoke I think this is a very good quality 2 cycle engine oil better then what Ive bought at stores I highly recommend this oil for several engines that need 2 cycle oil 
This quantity oil will met the needs for assorted small engines around the property To have a bulk source at a good price is worth the effort of measuring instead of buying the small premeasured bottlescans 
I got this for a friend of mine who says this is one of the best 2 cycle outboard oils he has ever used He said it burns cleanly and the engine seems to run better than when he has used other oils He plans on buying this product from now on and is worth a few more dollars to do so He thanked me for introducing it to him 
This is a premium oil It burns cleaner and the engine seems like it is running better with it I can tell a difference in it It is mostly subjective but then again if you know your engine you can probably tell right away I wish everyone used this at the lake as sometimes you can tell there have been too many boats with poorly maintained engines out on the water I really like to eat the fish I catch and keeping the water clean is always a great idea Cleaner burning less smell and less pollution Very good quality product 5 stars 
This is a fantastic synthetic blend 2 cycle engine oil that has an ashless formula for clean burning in any 2 cycle engine The oil meets or exceeds listed manufacturers specifications and will not void your engines warranty I have been using it in my Yamaha and find that it does burn very clean This is a very good product that will give you peace of mind knowing that your engine is getting fully lubricated each time you use it with this 2 cycle oil blended in your gas 
This is ultra high quality two cycle engine oil especially suited to marine engines found in jet skis and boats It gives high performance protection at all RPMs and meets or exceeds all manufacturers specifications I highly recommend this lubricant 
Use it for work No broken cups 
This would be great for 12 person camping especially for backpacking because its very light weight and compact For a family camping trip not so much I bought this anticipating it to be larger even given the diminisions it was smaller than I thought  an error on my part Ive given it to my toddler now for her play kitchen In a matter of 1 day of occasional toddler play it has a few dings and bends Nothing that would inhibit its function had the dents and bends occurred out on a trail Expect dings and scratches it will still function fine and for 7 what I paid via Amazon you cant go wrong 
Package and item arrived crushed Whose fault Dont know but cushioning was nonexistent so enough neglect to share This item is no where within light years of a military surplus strength mess kit so dont expect it  Consider your last soup canthat is twice as thick as the metal on the kit Very disappointed Would be returning to sender even if undamaged UPDATE WHAT Just heard from seller return item at self expense Item arrived damaged Now you want me to pay MORE to return YOUR mistake Coleman 5Piece Aluminum Mess Kit In The Trash Deep breath Amazon Hello Silence  Why do I have Prime again Hello Crickets   The sound of silence Seller not answering his phone left a voice message Called Amazon spoke with a representative oh so sorry but no actions taken Crickets continue to sing in the loud silence Have done all I can Watch yourself if you deal with Midwest Update Part Deux Deep sigh 10 emails to vendor One voice mail Two calls to Amazon customer service Credit Managed Worth it No Just hate to quit 
Nice for bug out bags 
These cheap mess kits that Coleman makes are just great They are super light super durable and easy to pack in a backpack I would stake my life on these kits 
Very flimsy Metal too thin Bends before it was on the heat 
Showed up very fast This cooler is beautiful and all that we hoped for 
Excellent really like the look of this cooler and more important holds ice for 23 days no problem 

Great price and product 
This is a very thin and lightweight fleece sleeping bag It can easily be opened to a blanket or zipped together with another one Small and good for what it does but dont expect to keep too warm 
I purchased these to insulate our 40 degree sleeping bags when camping on California cold spring nights With the temps ranging around 49 degrees at night we were not warm enough with just the sleeping bags We used fleece blankets before but they were not staying in place all night but with these sleeping bag liners the fleece is wrapped all around and stays in place Having the soft fleece under and over you when inside a sleeping bag helps immensely The rating on the package said that the liners add 13 degrees of warmth when used with a sleeping bag and I would agree with that claim When we ordered two the random colors we got were a steel gray and a rust orange I wish they let the customer choose the colors but both colors that they sent me were satisfactory I am very happy with the purchase 
I expected a lot more from a Coleman product This Coleman Stratus Fleece Sleeping bag is very thin and cheap feeling I purchased for my youngest daughter who didnt have a fleece bag yet and am very disappointed The bags we have for the rest of the family are far superior 
Mine came in green which is what I wanted There was no option to select color when I purchased 
Perfect So soft and makes a huge difference in the cold camping nights 
These camping pieces always come in handy You can cook a meal for one person with each set 
Garbage dont waste your money Mug You cant really drink hot things out of it without burning your hand Pan It is so small you cant even cook a small trout in it Pot Are you kidding me One can of soup wont even fit in it Worthless I think I used them once thinking they would be nifty They dont hold enough and the aluminum is so cheap and thin that you cant really do anything with them 
I have not tried to use this in a camp fire yet I am surprised at the size It is very small No way you will be able to cook for two people at once and I have some doubts that after a sturdy day of hiking it would allow me to prepare in one effort enough food for just me and I am by no means a large person I noticed another person mentioned they could not get the handle on Mine came with the handle on It rotates out of the way no need to attach or detach it 
You get what you pay for Fair priced Small 
Hard to clean but great for camping by yourself 
very light great for back packing classic design 
Ive been looking for a wellmade sturdy mess kit After this purchase I am still looking On the upside this is better than the other mess kit that I got that cost 4 more I think Im going to have to step up to the 20 range to get a better quality mess kit 
This set serves me well while out in the woods Its small smaller than one might expect by looking at the picture but this only makes it more portable Its strong and lightweight so it didnt take up much room and held up being crammed in my 3day pack I was able to use the skillet to scramble a couple of eggs and fry some hunks of spam separately while the pot held enough water to fill up the cup add freeze dried coffee 2x Take care not to use this set over a big open flame as it can damage it Its best to place 2 sticks over some hot coals then set your pot or pan on the sticks Wrapping the handle in cloth or using a stick to lift the pot is recommended 
These are just too cute Bought a set to go with the matching coffee pot Just adorable 
Old school classic that cant be best 
I got green Very comfy and nice construction I havent washed it yet so I cant really speak to what happens to the material after you wash it Im almost afraid to find out 

The zipper is a problem The dual zipper system is apparently not intuitive Twice I have had people using the bag end up with the zipper jammed and broken I like the bag it is perfect for warm climate camping here in Florida but I need somethning that does not require instructions to use 
Perfect inside a sleeping bag 
When I purchased this I had it in mind for sleeping at my buddys hunting camp He always keeps a wood fire going and it gets so hot in there that a normal sleeping bag would be far to much for me to ever want to imagine sleeping in This little guy however did the trick it kept me warm enough when the fire would die down that the cold didnt wake me up and when my buddy would get up and stoke the fire and the house filled with heat again I did not get to hot to roast alive in this bag I love sleeping in a sleeping bag and thanks to this I was still able to sleep in 1 in a hot camp All in all it worked perfectly for what I needed it for and I feel that it is also more comfortable than the inside of my coleman sleeping bag that has a tricot liner that catches on everything from calluses to toe nails I will be using this as a liner for that tricot sleeping bag and then I can easily wash this and not have to wash the larger sleeping bag as often I am 58 and I fit perfectly into this bag with no issues 
My husband snores and sometimes I end up curled up with the cats on the couch On those evening I just grab this and my pillow and Im super comfy Its soft and warm and cozy And I love that it can be completely unzipped to lay flat 
great product cant wait to use them 
For emergencies 
I used to have the same set when I was a kid but now the metal is very thin it does the job You just have to be real careful since the fry pan is so thin when cooking 
These pans are meant to get dented from time to time  They cook fast which is great in case you got to move quick and in a hurry  Camping and my bug out bag is what I use them for  
very thin flimsy feel to it not the quality of the BSA mess kit of your youth its nice that the cup is metal but if this is going to get more than occasional use you want to spend a little more money 
If you are going to use this as a mess kit this works great Anything other than that really and it shows its flimsiness It IS extremely light weight as advertised but using the frying pan for cooking anything heavier than a egg or some bacon is bound to bend the handle and the potdoesnt even holds a cup of waterhowever holds a single serving of baked beans to warm up it only holds enough water to boil for the small cup that is provided But using it to heat up a meal is fine But it is a great mess kit Tip keep the tissue paper it came with and use it as padding to keep everything still and from shifting while on the move or the constant clanging will get to you Also keep a small sponge in the kit to clean it with 
Not as durable as I would like but a decent set nonetheless 
This is a pretty good tent light and reasonably priced Pros Its small and easy to pack It safely attaches to the tent without causing and problems Its easy to use It works Flexible Cons The light it gives is a bit dim Many battery based lanterns give off much more light although not as flexible in positioning Its difficult to position with just one person because you have to have the magnet outside the tent and the light inside so unless you can reach to the point outside where you want it then you need to have someone else hold the magnet in place while you place the light inside the tent This isnt much of a problem though Overall I gave it 4 stars because it works and its easy to use and low priced It could use a brighter light but otherwise is pretty good 
it is bright enough runs off 4 AA batteries and has great battery life I just wish i had done more research first cuz for a few bucks more you can get one with a 50 range remote control That was my fault though But other than that gripe this light definitely works and has a VERY powerful magnet Requires 2 people to mountremove the light one outside the tent and one inside On a side note if you are camping with people that like to play pranks DO NOT mount this light over your head in the tent because someone outside can pull the magnet off and it will fall on your head which i imagine would be quite painful 
the cup and the pot are garbage the frying pan and the bowl are alright I picked this up to see if it was anywhere near the quality of my old one and it wasnt its really bad Go somewhere where you can actually look at the product before buying 
Solid classic light rugged useful nothing else to say 
Thank you 
Very thin One pot was dented but metal was so thin that I was able to bend it back into shape I bought this for my 5yr old son so hes happy I would not consider using this to cook with serving kit only 
good one 
I bought two of these for my boys for Christmas to use on scouting events Both cups came with the enamel chipped off in various places and sitting in the bottom of the cup The cups are also fairly small VERY disappointed with this purchase 
oLD SCHOOL BITCHIN 
Love these I used them as little gifts for my bridal party and used an enamel paint to draw a design on them They worked perfectly 

I love this cooler Love the design love that the handles are sturdy Love the drain has a bit of a gully in the bottom of the cooler to help direct the water out 
Worked great for camping I would purchase again 
Great extra light for tent Strong magnets 
Very handy for camping 
Love it small and easy to store anywhere 
ok 
ok cheaply constructed  I prefer titanium to aluminum now that I have experienced both 
Ive wanted to camp more for a while now so I finally got a group of friends together and did it I purchased this set as a rudimentary set to use and was supposed to be one of two people to bring dishes into camp Well they forget their set so I was definitely glad I purchased one before we went camping This set served my purposes well and is definitely meant for one or two people max If you have a small group of people or cook in batches it can still do the trick but it will just take longer Im confident this mess kit should last me a while Yes it scratches easily and loses its shine quickly but I really dont care about that since I only got it to function as a lightweight kit There are four main pieces in this mess kit a small cup frying pan a shallow pot and a shallow bowl The cup was able to hold about 8 oz of liquid the frying pan could easily fit a seared sausage and the pot was able to fit about half a can of soup with about to spare at the top in other words enough for one person PROS Lightweight Easy to assemble the handles They all stack together so they take up less room in your pack Perfect to use with a small camping stove Heats up quickly so you use less butane Only takes a minute or so cool down enough to eat but it kept the soup warm the whole time CONS Like many people said before me they stick very easily I dont know if this is just my paranoia but the handles seemed very flimsy They didnt break off while in use but I was constantly afraid they would 
nothing fancy simple camping set just enough of what you need for backpacking with no added weight i was pleased 
Works great for what it is I used it more as a blanket than a sleeping bag durable and the zippers never failed on me would be a nice warm weather sleeping bag if you dont want to carry a larger bag For under 20 bucks you could use it as a blanket for outdoor sporting events to stay warm and help cut down the wind if sitting in bleachers 

Really nice zipper not too bulky when packed down 
Quality at a low price 
Awesome light weight pack able fleece bags I use them as a liner when winter camping in sub freeze temps Nice cozy and warm 
great 
great for emergency use 
feels light but it gets the job done 
Got it for Scouts going hiking Fantastic Gets beat up and bends back to shape Clean it with some sand fine gravel etc wash it out and its like new except for the dings Light and small 
Its okay but the aluminum is so thin it dents very easily 
Way cool I like it a lot 
Fold up some tinfoil itll be better built 
Always great to have for camping 
This light is great in the tent and works OK for a mini lamp on tables The magnetic backing makes it easy to stick to the ceiling of the tent and it puts off a good amount of light Only downside is it does chew through batteries Shipping is fast and the light is durable and reliable 
Easy to use to shed light at night 
Nice camp cups for my set They seem well made 
Used these on our recent camping trip  I dont know why but nothing better then coffee from an Enamel mug in the morning Sturdy and will be around for a long time SUPER great price 
We use these for our motorcycle camping trips and we love them 
Great bag I have had it for 6 months Used it during the summer months by itself and in super cold weather used it as a liner for my cheap mummy bag This thing is great 
Great sleeping bag for cool nights Planning on buying a couple of more of them You can also unzip the sleeping bag and use it as a fleece blanket 
Adds a few degrees of warmth to your bag 
I returned it The plastic is just too flimsy There are better options available 

mounted steel plate that I made on fiberglass camper on my pickup Stays ok Made a mount for a friend after he saw mine Would like it a little brighter 
Use a lot of energy 
This kinda sucks I think Coleman could have done better 
can be used for a ton of applications I always keep a spare on hand replacement bulbs are fairly easy to find too 
Although the quality was fine I would have expected more light from this We have a large 810 person tent After centering it on the ceiling of the tent it was barely enough light to play cards under For a smaller tent I think it would be much more useful 
If youre a fan of the old school look steel belted coolerget this cooler Took me back to my childhood when I saw it In Florida at the beach in 90 degree weather it held ice just as well as a Yeti that was also in our group mic dropenough said 
Very cheap set of cookwear I had them in my bag for a 2 mile hike and when I was unloading my gear I noticed they were all dented and crushed I will say due to the thin cheap material everything heats very quickly But I equate them to paper plates and plastic silverwearone time use 
This set is all one person needs for a camping tripand on the last trip it was enough for me to share a dish with my buddy who forgot his Its lightweight aluminum so stuff will burn in it if youre not paying attention Still it always cleans up nicely for me The whole kit packs away into a secure clam shell shape and theres room in between items for a pot holder wash cloth and a little container of dish soap Ive had this set in my pack for almost 2 years now and it always serves me well 
on time as promised have used this product in the past not much to it but will work just fine 
Cute little package takes little room lite in the backpack Shipping was fast No problems with this seller Thank you 
This is not as useful as I hoped it would be Although it can be washed the laundering instructions are very specific and ask for a frontloading high capacity washer Coleman you need to come up with something that can be washed in a regular toploading washing machine At least if I had a tub I could soak it there 
I purchased a second one as a Christmas present for a friend Weve used these for a quick cover on sleeping pads 
Still using the light to this day and I bought this several years ago I just changed the batteries for the first time earlier this year 
Happy 
Great quality 
Excellent productafyer trying it I eill purchase 5 more Will rnjoy them next summer camping and fishing trips 
I thought they would be bigger my fault for not reading 12 oz 
Rested and missing enamel around rim I felt like it would cut my lip 
good for boy scout camp outs Just dont leave by fire long ours bent the first time but that could have been the operator akason 
Exactly what I was looking for Have a bunch of hunters in the family that hike to find their game This is perfect for throwing into backpacks 
Perfect  
I looked at the dimensions before buying and it was still smaller than expected though not smaller than the dimensions said I just incorrectly pictured the sizing in my head Fine if you are cooking for one person If you will have more people this set works well as collapsible bowls or a coffee cup while camping Folds up into a kit the size of a small bowl and takes up very little space Metal is not the strongest but I didnt expect it to be as its very inexpensive so it will bend if enough pressure is applied Overall a good product that I will take camping with me for many years to come 
The main pan w the handle the handle and connector could be made with an ever so slightly more sturdy thicker metal 
Got a steal of a deal on this bad boy Works great and I love the vintage look It is almost an exact replica of my dads cooler from back in the 70swhich I still have 
I sent it back as I wanted one that was electric 
Awesome cooler This is a very well made product 
Perfect for helping with colder temps 
When you live in the South and are involved in Scouting you ready do not need a heavy weight sleeping bag the majority of the time Outside of August and DecFeb Ive found this to be the perfect weight sleeping bag Lightweight breathes well rolls up tight and easy to clean just toss in the washing machine 
Great as a sleeping bag liner they will keep you about 10 degrees warmer also used on top of a queen inflatable mattress The only con is that color can not be chosen I bought 3 got 2 green and one bluewanted all orange 
Lost a star because I cant choose a color Will work great as a sleeping bag liner for the winter as well as a stand alone bag for the hot summer months 
Cozy warm extra sized Used on camping trip last week Only thing and I should have knownbecause its polar fleece dont wear polar fleece or else they stick together and you cant slide in or around very easy After that night I slept in cotton or polyester blend and I could move just fine It definitely kept me warmer than I expected Would buy again and highly recommend especially for us girls that are always cold 
awesome liners 
I got this for a summer beer festival camping trip in upstate NY and it was perfect It seems very lightweight but its surprisingly warm The overnight low was in the mid50s and I was perfectly comfortable The only drawback is that you cant choose your color at least when I ordered it But I received the green one and I like it a lot I would say its an avocado green color like a 70s living room carpet It comes with a stuff sack but its hard to get it back in This is definitely a car camping sleeping bag 
Just hang a flashlight or LED lantern inside the tent This thing is a joke The magnet is so strong it seems like you risk tearing the tent 
Very good tent light It doesnt blind you by any means and casts enough light to even read by Its pretty ruggedly built so it stows and goes without any problems Out of all the tent lights Ive used this has been the best bang for the buck and recommend to anyone who needs a little illumination during the twilight hours 
nice little mess kit does the job on overnights 
You get what you pay for I bought these for a 72 hour kit They are not high quality nothing I would recommend for backpacking or extended use These will work well to boil water for freezedried and dehydrated food I have had aluminum mess kits in the past Food sticks easily to them even with oilbutteretc and they are hard to clean Out of the 5 I bought 3 had screws which were off but in the box If you are looking for one for extended use or clean easier try a teflon mess kit 
Great starter and light weight Not very durable Use this as a starter set for the kids 
Perfect camping mess kit with everything from a pan to boil water to a cup to drink coffee or cook some eggs and bacon Whether you are backpacking going to a music festival or out at a tailgate this makes a perfect addition to your outdoor kitchen It can easily assist two people in eating off sanitary surfaces maybe three if you eat out of the pan with the handle 
Its flimsy Weighs nothing but its weak 
Christmas present for hubby he saw the box at the door when we got home so he got it early Loves it 
Would not recommend Its very flimsy material and too small Spend the extra dollars and get something better 
Junk 
Ive had this a while havent used it Price was OK 
Just the right size for camping 
This has been vital to increasing the the thermal energy therefore ridding any biological contamination while increasing palatability of my sustenance while occupying inhospitable terrain 
Nice kit 
i use it every month for scouts and it works great 
I just bought two similar mess kits for my boys both scouts at WalMart for the same price This one is significantly inferior It is flimsy slightly smaller and doesnt nest well This is definitely not the version that lasted me 30 years 
This tent light is great You can install it with ease as its held up by magnets Will be great for camping next summer 
Bought this to replace a bulkier bag for a summer backpacking trip It ended up being a little chillier than expected so this wasnt really enough to keep me warm It really is just a thin fleece blanket with a zipper But the bag itself is made well and Ill find other uses for it 
Worked well 
Very soft and comfortable sleeping bag insert My sleeping bag was is rated for 35 degrees and we decided to go camping when it was getting down to about 24 at night This sleeping bag insert definitely helped me stay warmer than it would have been without it I wont say that I was totally comfortable and toasty but it definitely saved me from having a miserable night Its nice how it give a little cushion in your sleeping bag too and it can easily be paired with another to make a large blanket It was rather difficult to keep it from twisting around in my sleeping bag because it twisted around easily and did not stay still if you moved around throughout the night It did not seem to be too breathable which made me sweat periodically which just made the crazy cold worse Overall it works and is definitely cheaper than brands such as thermarest It does its job but I wouldnt exactly take it on a backpacking trip due to its bulky size If it was crazy cold again I would definitely use it once more 
Purchased as a backup blanketlight bag for camping Been actually using it as a light blanket for bed during the summer I got it on an Amazon lightning deal and couldnt be more pleased with it It is also very easy to roll up and store The fleece isnt the softest material that is the only downside Ive found to this 
Two packs of block ice lasted for 7 days until it was completely gone Drained the cooler once per day Mix of being in the car and outside in temps from 5070 Fantastic cooler Great alternative to the Yeti if you want a good camping cooler Pro tip Buy two blocks of ice put them in a cooler Next line the inside of the cooler with a black garbage bag Now line it with a second one The ice should be sitting below the garbage bags outside of them Place your food inside the garbage bags That will keep your food from getting wet You will need to change the garbage bags after 3 days or so due to condensation from the food packaging and what not But the melting ice will not get the food wet 
This is a very heavy duty cooler It will last FOREVER Very well made Only FLAW is it doesnt come with a food trayMost coolers this expensive have one Also Coleman doesnt make one as a accessory Im off to the 99c store for a size that will fit Love the stainless steel 
this seriously is a great cooler i have had ice in it since monday i am prepping a turkey for thanksgiving and put 6 bags of ice in monday night and they are still 45 bags of ice left great room and the handles with the rubber is so nice on the hands it seals so perfectly and keeps every cool on the insice the bottle opener is nice to have but the drain is great so you dont have to tip it to get water out i even had this outside when it was 10 outside with water in it and nothing on the inside froze that is how good this is this is the best cooler i have owned and it is not close 
it works to bad there was not something you could use so you would not burn your hand trying to remove it from the heat 
Cheap but functional 
This kit was not for me The metal is thin and food sticks easy You have to be careful and keep the heat low I ordered these for a lightweight kit to have on my motorcycle camping trip but I wish I had just taken regular dishes I left them in the garbage on the last night and will I guess they are alright for some but too thin for me 
Ive used this exact set in the past Dont waste your money EVERYTHING sticks to these pans extremely difficult to clean when camping Cooking in them always turns them black and the aluminum can warp or melt if used on a propane cooking stove over the direct flame The aluminum handle not only gets hot when used to cook but warps and bends with any weight beyond a couple of eggs in the pan Since the handle is flimsy and also used to hold the kit together when not in use it often will not fit back together after you bent it and picked it up off the camp stove or campfire with your hot food In 40 years time no one has bothered to improve the quality of this item The only difference now as opposed to 1970s its made in China 
Great service my son loves it 
Cheap but very light weight 
A very good copy of the old palco 
THIS COLEMAN TENT LIGHT IS A GREAT IDEAI REGIMEND IT TO EVERYONE WHO CAMPSIT IS GREAT THAT YOU CAN ATACH IT TO THE TENT 
This worked but really wasnt what I expected Kind of fragile and didnt last too long I would look for something more robust next time 
Ive had this lamp for more than 10 years It works great Its bright enough to see everything in my 6 man tent 
Very nice coffee cups I was a little worried because some reviews stated they received chipped and damaged items mine were very well wrapped with bubble wrap and foam  No damage whatsoever I can not wait to use them on my grandsons first camping trip with me 
Good camp mug Stands up to being thrown into a bin with the rest of my camping equipment and its a good price Not much more can be expected 
Excellent enamel cup great size the blue enamel is thick and durable I pack this with my thermos excellent value 
great for camping 
Prefer the Bundle Monster ones These have a larger hole at the bottom where the zipper starts together Fleece doesnt feel as soft and seems more pilled than the others I tried Dont like I cant pick what color I want Serves its purpose well and provides extra warmth on 30 degree nights or plenty of coverage without a sleeping bag on warmer nights 
Wife likes it more than me 
Perfect for a wrap at the campfire blanket sleeping bag insert etc 
Too thin for summer time camping with morning temps in the mid 50s Had to layer with another thicker one I could see this being useful as a throwover if you were inside a house on a cold day 
Not the best kit out there but it works well 
Was very satisfied with the product and the prompt shipping that was provided All items were what was described Nothing was left out 
Utilitarian they do the job nicely These kits are lightweight and easy to care for They seem flimsy but they do just fine for cooking and eating and take up minimal space This kit is geared for hiking and minimalist campouts The only downfall  dont lose the wingnut I looked over some fancier kits and plastic mess kits because this single aluminum kit is both cookware and platesbowls All you need are utensils The less I need to lug around the better And the simpler the better And no I dont plan on making gourmet meals on the trail climbing Mt Everest or trying to impress the wildlife with my chic taste in cookware FYI I had a set just like this as a kids and got many years of good service out of it In fact my old childhood kit is still at my folks place in the the gun safe I bought two new kits for my son and I now that hes a scout 
Incredibly lightweight yet good quality Very nice to have something that weighs not even a pound it seems while camping 
This kit is almost perfect for a Scout It is lightweight selfcontained and as durable as it needs to be Only two minor drawbacks First it does not include utensils We got him a small steel forkknifespoon set that clips together but it doesnt fit within this mess kit Second the screw and wingnut that holds the kit together is easy to lose particularly for a youngster But the kit and utensils are cheap enough that if he loses any parts mark that down as a lesson in responsibility We still prefer this for Scouting over the more expensive plastic kits particularly because a boy CAN attempt to cook with it over the coals 
Dont expect these to last long Too thin but will do in a pinch 
Fits in our motor home bins below Keeps the drinks very cold dont let anyone sit on it it squishes the gasket and ruins the seal we learned the hard way everyone wants to sit on it when it is out of the bin these are not chairs people 
This is a very cool looking cooler It was just the right size for a weekend camping trip for me and my three kids It was not too warm 60s at highest but I really didnt have much ice to add and it all stayed cool for 3 days Couldnt ask for more I am sure it would do well in summer with lots of ice The handles and latch all seem very sturdy and it has a drain plug which is nice 
I like it a lot Love the drain And at 13 the price of a Yeti Oh yeah 
THE BEST COOLER GOING WORKS GREAT AND HAVE SILVER ONE TWO YEARS OLD AND STILL WORKS GREAT THIS IS THE CATS MENOW 
Quality built and looks good 
Bright lightbright enough for a 10 person tent Lasted a week easily Its a tad heavy so i wouldnt use it for backpacking 
the magnet is very strong and holds it up well I have not had any issues with scratching or tearing to the tents fabric 
Ive used this light inside my own personal and inside the canvas tents at Cub Scout Resident Camp Provided plenty of light I love the way it attaches The magnet is very strong and held it to my tent Enough light to see but not too bright that it drew a ton of bugs Follow the Instructions and DO NOT ATTACH IT THE NETTING OF YOUR TENT you will rip your tent I did not do this as I read them however I can see how it could tear holes in the netting Its a tad heavy for the netting and will pull it down and will rib holes Also DO NOT SLIDE it on your tent you will rip holes in it If its not in the spot you want it detach the magnet and reposition it Overall I love this light its convenient I do not need to find space to place a lantern Like all my battery operated items I camp with I store it in a plastic tub and take the batteries out 
it is a nice light to light up a tent but it is a dull light and isnt extremely bright but it will help see in the pitch black 
Good tent light Only complaint is that when taking the magnet backing off the battery compartment sometimes came with No big deal it just slips right back into place Good amount of light for our tent 
I bought one of these from my local Walmart 5 years ago and use it an easy 20 times a year and have had no problems with the plastic connection knob to the bottle I have not had any cracks or leaks I believe those who do think they have to tighten this well beyond the needed torque for a good seal I havent experienced any rust either though I live in a fairly arid place Since I first put my propane lantern on the top I have never removed it This has saved me a lot of money as 20 gallons of propane is far cheaper than 20x1 gallon bottles I pay 1200 to fill my 20 gallon bottle and the one gallon bottles almost cost 500 that is almost a 90 savings It has paid for itself several times over Just remember do not over torque the connection and tighten the leveling support firmly down to the top of the bottle to prevent it from leaning over 
Absolutely Fabulous Great Safe Product 
Im impressed I have a Coleman extreme 5 day cooler and side by side on a camping trip this cooler was holding ice as good as that one and looks 100xs better So glad I finally ordered it For the 54 qt size this is my preferred chest 
Got two of these one for each tent for our camping trip They attach to the top of your tent using strong magnets and a back plate The light is inside the tent and the plate is outside the tent Hint attach your light before you put the rain fly on These lights were great for providing getting around light inside tents but they could have been a little brighter in my view They are not bright enough for any real reading but they are certainly bright enough for getting out clothing making beds etc Im very happy with this purchase 
This item sounded so good in previous reviews However from the first camping trip I was not a fan It is pretty heavy and the tent sags when in place The next time I took it out for a camping trip the light no longer works because the bottom cover does not snap into the plastic anymore and the batteries fall out Do not recommend 
No as heavy or thick as I thought but they are nice I would purchase them again 
Great for camping 
Great for camping 
These were much smaller than I expected which is probably my fault for not reading the description closely enough but my real issue is that the enamel has started chipping off after a single camping trip 
These are perfect for camping and a super great price I bought 5 
Too hot for summer Light as hell though 
As expected but was hoping for a color other than grey 
Not a sleeping bag 
I lived in my car for a few months in the summer and this provided nice bedding lighter than a sleeping bag In the winter it added extra insulation to make my sleeping bag warmer Plus it acts as a sheet which I can machine wash more often than I wash my sleeping bag 
Good quality product at a great price Happy Jack 
compact cheap my original Boyscout mess kit 40 years later not much higher price light compact good for a bug out bag 
Great survival gear 
great 
What more do you want its an inexpensive mess kit 
Perfect size and price for my needs Exactly what I expected Of course its flimsy these have been around since the dawn of camping everyone knows what these are and how they are made Make sure not to lose the wing nut and screw 
very nice kinda heavy for such a small light and didnt hang up easily but over all a good a good light 
nice vintage lookthere is a little play in the lid as it sealswas concerned at first but was pleasantly surprised to wake up the next morning with almost all of the ice still intactoverall happy 
They love itworks great 
Perfect for hiking or camping Great size and great look 
Believe it or not metal gets hot even with the enamel coating So yes hot liquids will cause the rim and handle to heat up That being said its a nice tough little mug and mine arrived defect free Its used mostly for my tea heated up on the coals from the morning campfire It does take a bit for the mug to cool off but the contents stay plenty warm For five bucks I dont mind if it gets scorched or if the enamel wears just my two cents 
Item as expected Love it 
not exactly what i though i was getting this was advertised with the Coleman retro cooler line the photo led me to believe the cooler and stand were sized together so they made a nice interlocking connection the cooler literally just sits on top of this frame and is not very stable 
This was not as sturdy as I thought it should have been kinda wobbly We used it a couple of times If you are on a level ground it would work much better Cooler did not fit right on it I will keep trying to use it 
We returned it but the item was very sturdy and nice just did not fit our needs or grill 
I have 3 of these stands and I have to say the negative reviews are from people that have no idea how to use it or what stable is I have overtaxed my stands holding up coolers barbecues and general camp boxes with no problems If your stove is too short to fit across the top then throw a piece of board across the stand and set the stove on that 
Ive ordered 3 of these now Theyre perfect for warm summer camping  very lightweight and comfortable Theyre also great for medical residents on call in the hospital I always bring this on night shifts in case I get a chance to retreat to the call room and take a nap  much more comfortable than standard hospital bedding 

This is tiny and a little hard to make pancakes on However it packs up really really well My only real complaint is how depressingly small that tin cup is Couldnt I have just one more centimeter of coffee It makes all the difference 
I modified it a bit by getting rid of the cup altogether It hand cleans easily enough but dont put it in the dishwasher 
Heavyish but for 7 bucks its a good way to make a few meals if you arent spending enough time outside to justify buying a real cookmess kit 
Same design for a 20 years Good as ever 
Old Reliable Smaller than I remembered though 
It should come spoons forks  knifes 
I camp in a popup trailer There are times when I am drycamping or when the lights that are built into my trailer do not turn on right away My trailer is a bit old During those times I clip this battery light onto one of the curtains near my bunk and it hangs there safely and provides me with enough light to read books or to simply get around my trailer at night It goes through the batteries relatively fast but if I bring enough batteries to be able to load it up once a day I get by okay with this light I like that is rather oldfashioned looking and uses a regular lightbulb instead of the LED ones The light seems to be a better quality for reading 
For the price this might is great but to small or to big love the fact that it has a magnet to hold it in place works great for reading and any thing you want to do The only down fall with this might is it is not all that bright but like I said it still do is job 
bought as bundle with tent and tent kit provides enough light while leaving hands free to do what you need to do 
01232013 I received my product very fast but after installing the batteries the product was useless I even tried a new batteries set and yet didnt work I am not going to give up and going to get a replacement and see what happens 01262013 Received the second one and after installing the new batteries it worked as expected so far no complaint but I havent used it in the field will update later 
This was part of a package deal to go with the tent I purchased its okay but would have never bought it if it was not part of the package 
Great for entry lighting Bright enough to light a large tent yet dim enough not to wake everyone Magnet attatchment is perfect for install anywhere 
The quality isnt great I had to return the first one and the second one they sent me has bubbles in the finish Too much trouble to return it again 

Arrived with a dent on top of the cooler The cooler is metal on the exterior so its very susceptible to dents Return process was easy but we were unable to use it for our camping trip the week we purchased Better off going to a store to get this 
the aluminum is very thin and bends easy in a backpack Also they are not easy to clean while camping Next time Im spending more money to buy a durable easy to clean mire expensive titanium set 
Happy with it 
Lightweight and cheap 
I will start by sayingthatI LOVE the Coleman brand But this is trully a horrible grilling stand First of all the rubber or whatever the black part melted within 15 minutes of using it Also the stands is flimsy and will slide open Now I might have gotten a defected one but i doubt it It has no support and my grill kept falling right out It is therefore very dangerous I really wanted to love it as like I mentioned before I love the Coleman brand 9y of my camping equipment is from Coleman But I can not recommend this stand to anyone I have 3 small children and I jusy dont feel comfortable using it around them  Or anyone for that matter I wish we would have just put our money towards a more sturdy and bigger fold up station to begin with I took it to one 4 day camping trip came home put it away to maybe think of a different use But its been so long that honestly Ill probsbly end up throwing it away I guess theres a first time for everything cause for the first time Im dissapointed with this brand 
This product I will used for my portable grill holding a large ice chest or use as a garbage receptacle Great price and fast shipping 
great height and easy use 
Excellent item glad I purchased 
Received this quickly Fits the coleman stove perfectly 
Cant wait to use with my Coleman icebox 
So theyre pretty fancy blankets They go great as an additional liner to some ultra light sleeping bags we bought with hardly any insulation These definitely help to make up for it Might be a little difficult to bring both the sleeping bag and liner with us on backpacking trips were obviously terribel planners Bad news they only came in gray Wah wah wahhhhhhhhhh 
Put this in my 40 degree bag on an extended November hike in Va and slept sound on a 30ish degree night Very happy with it 
When used with 40 degree sleeping bag and Alps micro fiber liner comfortable down to 30 degrees Well made and works well as part of a sleeping system 
Didnt get the color I wanted and its just an alright light sleeping bag 
For the price this thing is hard to beat I used it to insulate my sleeping hammock while on a camping trip to the Grand Canyon There are 2 zippers I really like the one on the bottom that can be used to open it and let me wrap it all the way around my hammock Only thing I will say bad is I didnt get to chose my color when I ordered it Probably because I bought it on Deal of the Day 
We purchased these after losing identical mugs during a house move These mugs keep the liquid hot and theyre very durable perfect for camping Very happy customer 
Its a metal mug Light weight Hasnt killed me No insulation but its metal 
Great to have 
The Coleman tent light is a great little gadget we never had when we were growing up It serves a good purpose and works well Great gift idea for the outdoor people in your life 
This is great when you just need to know where if youre going to run into your back pack on the floor of your tent or accidentally knock something over Do read the directions before you set up your tent I made that mistake and realized that the magnet goes on the outside of the tent so the lamp can connect to the magnet between the tent on the inside I ended up hanging it with a rope 
Just like the kit I used in scouting Nothing fancy but it works 
Only because I was told short after about how aluminum and cooking with aluminum is a contributor to Alzheimers For the first time I used it though It was neat But it should be made with stainless steel Sure its a bit more weight but you wont get Alzheimers 
No Good I never use this set the cup is too small the pan handle is not sturdy AT ALL Not what I expected maybe I will give to a little kid to have a tea party with them 
You do get a lot of stuff with this kit but I only wonder how long it will last if you were stranded on an island for 6months to a year I would not be sure that this kit would last the material is very lightweight 
Good 
I bought this for my new Coleman Grill stove Its supposed to fit on top I didnt trust it not to dump my stove as there wasnt a good secure way to place it on the stand I placed a put of plywood on the stand then set the stove on top of that This setup works well I was surprised at how sturdy the stand was when set up but Im sure some kids could knock it over Im pretty happy with this stand but I am careful around it 
Perfect fit easy to store 
I didnt buy mine on Amazon but have had one for around 4 years Mine is all stainless steel which gets hot but somehow keeps ice for days I have a Coleman 120 quart that advertises keeps ice for 6 days Not even close After 3 days all the ice was melted in the 120 quart and steel one still had ice The big disappoint for me is my latch is steel but the hook is plastic After a few uses I could open the lid without turning the latch open Important for float trips if you turn the canoe over All my stuff in the cooler fell out into the river I hate plastic parts on pieces that get used repeatedly 
What a disappointment I love the retro looks of this cooler I bought it to replace a 1970s Thermos cooler I loved and used for decades It looks like a quality product The problem It doesnt keep things cool It is probably fine to bring to a picnic for an afternoon but forget camping Ice melts within an hour I dont even think it would hold up to a day at the beach Unfortunately I purchased it in June and didnt use it until just this past Labor Day Weekendtoo late to return it otherwise it would definitely be going back 
Well what can you say it is a cooler it worked for the 2 days I needed it to and was a large enough capacity for me I guess the issue will always be the Quarts these things hold versus the weight they are when full This one was a good weight for volume for me to easily lift full into the car 
Very nice Cole man 1w Ounce Coffee Cup for Hunting and Camping purchased this with the percolating Coffee pot that shows Coffee percolating in the lid For generations campers have enjoyed this type of coffee while camping hunting or just taking trips to the mountains it maintains excellent coffee flavor and I would highly recommend these 12 oz Coffee Hot Chocolate and Tea cups to others who enjoy the out doors or just love a fresh brewed cup of coffee 
Ive had a few camp site cups over the years the Coleman are now my favorite 
These are very nice to add to your sleeping bag on extra cold nights or to use while watching the sunset when its getting a little chilly outside 
Waiting for the end of days to test this Ill update then 
Got rid of comforters this is a nice layering tool inside my 50 degree sleeping bag Very soft and cozy I like the zipper as well Great none snagging design 
This item will improve the cold weather rating on any of your sleeping bags just put it inside your bag It will help keep you warm and dry I recommend this product so that you dont have to purchase a new cold weather bag Works great 
Great summer sleeping for the Gkids for the RV Wish I could pick my own colors 
Bought it because it was cheap in 2006 Ive taken it on about 8 backpacking trips and finally got fed up with it and threw it out at the end of this past season because everything stuck to it Certainly got my use out of it though The handle never really felt secure It was fairly nonstick when new Always prone to scorching and hot spots as are manymost cheap backpacking skillets are I guess for the 999 I paid for it in 2006 I certainly got my moneys worth This skillet is a use for one season and throw it out and buy another for next season 
Everythings perfect thanks 
Outstanding product very useful anytime and not just for emergency has a lot of every day uses 
good product 
Exactly what I was wanting Very light and small enough to place in your backpack Comes with pot plate pan and cup It is aluminum so it may dent or warp but that can be eliminated by packing it with soft items and cooking over hots coals instead of a blazing fire Delivery was very quick Thanks for the product 
Nice price but you get what you pay for I recommend paying more for better quality 
Bought this for my Boy Scout grandsonhe loves it 
I have used this light for quite a few trip and it works as advertised It is so easy to put in place never moves and the switch is easy to operate It has plenty of light for any tent and is really convenient nothing more needed My only complaint is battery life Today this should have an LED instead of a filament bulb I would expect the battery life to be at least four times what it is with this bulb and it could be brighter if the designer so desires An LED light should last far longer and the risk of a burned out bulb would be much less A fine light but a bit dated 
I bought the Coleman Tent Light for a recent camping trip since it matched thenbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefColemanTentFandpB0009PUPSSrefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTF8Coleman Tent FananbspI had also ordered The Coleman Tent Light runs on a pair of AAcell batteries and features a simple one onoff switch on the side Like the Tent Fan the Tent Light uses a magnetic mounting plate that goes on the outside of the tent wherever you choose to locate it and the light goes on the inside with the magnets holding it securely in place You have to literally twist the metal plate to remove the light from its position so it wont easily fall at random The light output isnt as much as you would expect by looking at the light It wasnt very bright in pitch darkness it had enough light to help me move around in my tent but nowhere near as much light to read from Because of the low light output the price is a little high for what comes down to a camping night light I ended up turning it on at night to make it easier to locate my tent in the darkness as it gave y orange tent a soft glow That said If youre looking to light up your tent youll need to use a proper lantern instead like I did 
ok so i just received my package and everything seems to be on point put the 4 batteries and closed it back up now after 30 minutes of use the light turned off i know its not the batteries because i just opened them up fresh i looked at the bulb and it does not seem that the connection of the wire burned out and now i dont know what to do i will contact them to see why this happened but i do like this little device 
Great for family camping trips where you can afford the weight for batteries This is a durable piece of equipment and has a decent battery life If you have kids who are afraid of the dark or want to have a light in their tent this is a good product 
It works but is a bit flimsy given it is meant to hold a fairly large cooler since it is wide If you are using it in a campsite that is not almost perfectly level it may be an issue and buckle under the weight on uneven ground We have other Coleman stands such as the kitchen one and those seem a lot sturdier even thought a stove is a lot lighter than a loaded cooler with ice But so far so good 
Works as advertised although a little trickysticky to foldunfold Perhaps a bit of graphite on the spready bits could help smooth things out Held everything we put on it with steady aplomb 
its a coleman nothing more to be said my second one in 20 years 
I saw one of these being used in a RV park to put a cooler on or a table top grill on I bought one and cut me a couple of 1X6 boards that lay across the top braces so as to make a nice table top for things I bring to the camp site works great and I dont have to bend over when Im digging in the bottom of the igloo 
Worked well and nice and compact Would have like to see a design where the legs locked rather than having to peg down the legs Also need to have something to hold up the propane canister We used an adjacent table But it still worked well and am pleased with it overall 
Multi use Good for travel 
These days were mostly car camping to get our toddler acclimated to the outdoor and sleeping in a tent And this is a perfect car camping cooler It holds what we need and keeps everything cool  while also doubling as a nice prep area for mealtime And its a much better deal than than certain other coolers that are all about brand name over function 
Excellent quality very durable plastic base with steel shell keeps contents cold for 34 days max without restocking the ice 
I so loved the looks of this It works well ice lasted a lot longer then the plastic coolers They had heads turning when we drove by on back of flat bed It was a perfect match for me 
This light is pretty awesome Weve had ours for going on 3 years and no issues We take the batteries out after every camping trip though The light bulb has never needed to be replaced Were going to get another one as weve just upgraded our tent from a dome tent to a 2 room tent its not bright enough to read with but its bright enough to see what youre doing in a dark tent without shining a flashlight in someones eyes The huge magnet it comes with has no damaged our tent in any way and its not rusty after many many camping trips Well worth the  
I dont have this for reading late at night in my tent I just wanted a light so I could see where I put everything And as a light source it works well I have a military issue 2man tent which I cant find a comparable commercial model but it has 3 poles that arch over the top to create the frame I placed this light at the strongest junction where 2 of the poles met and even though this light feels a little heavy in the hand there was no sag to my tent The magnets are strong and when theres no material between the magnets and the metal bracket trying to separate the two almost always results in the light cover coming off This wasnt a problem taking if off the tent and while its in my pack Ive taken to keeping the paper instructions between the magnet and the bracket which makes it easy to separate them without pulling the cover off This is also deisgned as more than just a tent light It comes with drywall anchors and wood screws in case youre just looking for a battery powered light to put in a closest or remote location without electricity 
I have to say that this came in handy on more than one occasion Its one of those things that you didnt know you needed until you got it I used to use a battery powered lantern inside the tent at night but it was always getting kicked around by accident and it is always shining in your face This light shines from overhead and isnt obnoxious The only complaint I have is that the magnetic backing plate which is the part that stays on the outside of the tent rusted a bit in the rain that we had Nothing significant but it did tarnish and left a small mark on my tent 
Ive used this twice and love it When I camp I do alot of reading so this is perfect for my tent The only problem with it is that when I feel the need to read on my back I cant see any text since the lights on the roof of the tent I havent tried to put it on the wall or ground but Im sure thatll fix the problem The lights held up with a magnet so its easy to install and remove The lights bright and takes 4 AA batteries If youre a person who needs light in your tent after dark this is going to be perfect for you 
Kind of a disappointment I bought this for my Coleman Camp Propane Stove Just like everyone else has said it just doesnt fit I have had to bring a plywood board with min to put down on this stand It adds bulk to my car and looks bad Coleman just needs to do a little more work on their product refinement process 
you need a board or something to work as a table top this thing is a burn waiting to happen without one But its at a great height 
Purchased this in May 2016 to hold my Coleman camp stove When I spread it out there was no way to lock mine into place as some have noted There is nothing on the legs to lock They just slide up but wont stay in place So to keep it sturdy I purchased small hose clamps and slid them over the legs Spread the stand apart and tighten the clamps down Now I have a sturdy stand but I still dont trust it to hold my stove so I have a piece of plywood over the top Didnt bother to send it back Not worth the effort Impulse buy 
gotta have one to camp old school 
perfect 
These are smaller than i expected but thats my fault for not checking out 12 ounces first Bought these for camping 
We have enjoyed Coleman products for many years Has there been a change Apparently so This enamelware mug is constructed of very thin easily bendable metal lightly clad in enamelware The mug arrived with a nickel size chip on the rim which was badly rusted Not only unhygienic but easily able to cut your lip Unacceptable Very disappointed 
what can I say its a cup it held water while I drank it 
A decent lightweight bag but I found the same type of bag at Dicks Sporting Goods for 10 less after I had ordered 
Wonderfully soft Purchased to use at a summer camp but I will be using this around the fire pit this summer Refolds well to fit back into drawstring bag Hubby also says he will take this when he travels next month as he is concerned about bedbugs even in nice hotels Problem solved 
The warmth I feel from the liners is unmeasurable Because I dont have a thermometer handy 
Good quality Exactly what I would expect from Coleman The fabric has the weight and feel of Polartec 300 I dont think its Polartec but it feels the same It unzips to flat so it could be used as a blanket There was no choice of color when ordering and the one I got was an ugly reddish dirty rusty color Im going to use it as a liner in my sleeping bag for winter camping so the color doesnt matter to me The only real issue is its too short Im 511 and after being laundered it barely comes up to my shoulders The length seems to be an industry standard because I couldnt find another brand that offered a longer one Pay attention Coleman I would have paid extra for one that was 46 longer 
Probably too heavy for the ultralight backpacking crowd but good for adding about 10 degrees to your sleeping bag I didnt get all tangled up during the night With a little care in operation zipper should not become a problem 
Great warm weather light sleeping bag or liner Price is right too The reason I did not give it 5 stars was of course the lack of color choice 
This light hangs a bit heavy on a small tent I was borrowing but I found it worked out really well just above the doorflap It allowed me to go to my tent at night and find everything I needed to change into my PJs and pop into bed This light was EXTREMELY useful and reassuring to have around its a musthave for me What would make it EVEN better would be if the light had two brightness settings Its current brightness and an even brighter setting that would allow me to read a book more easily 
I bought one of these tent lights over 10 years ago and had to purchase another since I misplaced it The light is very bright and is great to put in a tent I am not crazy about the dome shape wish it was more like a lantern with a handle but this thing totally works well 
I use this coleman tent light inside an enclosed utility trailer When the trailer isnt hooked up to my truck my dome lights inside the trailer dont work With this small light I just use the magnetic feature on the light and attach it to the inside wall of the trailer I can move it around anywhere I want without having to attach it permanently The magnets are surprisingly strong I use it in the tent while camping and in the trailer when Im not 
I think many people already mentioned this product has pros and cons as everything in this life Well this tent light has positive and negative things First of all I use this product in a Coleman tent of about 8feet x 8feet It is bright enough to help you during a night not to read o play cards just enough light to move within the tent Consider that there is a new model with leds instead this krypton bulb but costs almost as double as this is The advantage of having magnets and a metal plate to mount it on the tent gives you the advantage of putting it virtually in any place of the tent Most of the lanterns have to be mounted hang them on the top of the tent but this is practically to be mounted anywere in your tent Particularly I place it right at the top of the tents door Maybe having two of them for my tent would be nice and bright enough if I put them in opposite walls but Im not gonna do that because I already own a Brunton Glorb Four LED Lantern wich gives a poor light to be a four leds but combining this and the Coleman is enough light The main cons I found in this Coleman tent light is its brightness enough to see inside the tent but no more Again consider that newest models of Led lanterns will give more brighter light than this on but maybe they will cost more tha this one It is heavy for backpacking but quite well in my case because I do car camping So again consider that a Led Lanter can be smaller and lighter As consequence of its weight you have to be cautios were you place it and consider that it will make your tent sag in that zone you place it The best thing of it is the idea of the magnets and the mounting plate This idea gives you a kind of freedom to put this lamp in the best place according to your criteria and your needs and not only have a lamplantern on top of your tent 
It is not bright at all Ive used it a few times and have brandnew Energizer Lithium batteries and it is not bright enough to see any detail like on zippers and things Its like being in a dimly lit bar Also its very heavy so when you attach it magnetically to your tent it will make the tent sag considerably You cant use those mesh shelves it will yank them right down So you have to reach clear up on top of the tent under the rain fly then have someone else hold the other part of the light if you have a family size tent There are a lot brighter lighter and better lights for the same money 
it is what it is and does what it does my guy used it on the road no complaints light and packable great price fast delivery 
As expected Thin light aluminum mess kit They have been well used and beat up still work and cleans easy 
Easy 
get little stand folds up and opens easily looks like itll be a great general purpose stand 
will not fit coleman stove when porpane tank is installed sending it back today and its very flimsy as well 
This product is very flimsy and unstable While it can take the weight of large grills one little nudge and the stand became unstable making this a very dangerous item to set grills on I would only recommend use if it is on a flat surface and never in danger of being bumped which means staying far away while trying to use it 
works great i use it as a stand for my chuck box lighter and easier to setup than home made wooden legs 
delivered as promised still use 

I was trying to save some money by buying this Coleman frying pan I wish I would have spent a little more on something of better quality The first time I used this pan the coating began peeling off and sticking to the food I was cooking I noticed small black speckles all over my food When I washed the frying pan a large amount of the black coating peeled off I dont know what the black coating is but I am certain that I dont want to eat it Garbage 
Worked well on a recent camping adventure 
Lightweight durable and easy to clean Pretty small which is nice for backpacking The only thing I dont like about this mug is the heat dissipation The handle gets really really hot when you pour near boiling water into it which you do all the time when backpacking So my morning coffeetea routine turns into letting this sit on the ground for 510 minutes before drinking because it burns my fingers if I try to hold it Ill probably look for something else to bring from now on because of this 
I was disappointed by the overall size of the mug and the sharp edge under the lip of the rim I knew that it only held 12 oz but didnt realize that meant when filled to the very brim I was just expecting the mug to be larger I purchased a pair but the porcelain finish on one was badly chipped out of the package Both were returned for a refund more for the chip than anything else 
the same thing happen to me the plastic knob broke on my tree also made by coleman i called coleman and they do not make a replacement knob 
Good little stand There is no hookin or clips for this to attach to any of their grilles Would be great to hold trash bags when youre done cooking 
Sturdy easy to put up Got it for my Coleman cooler to get it off the ground Fill the cooler with ice and beverages it stands up without support or being propped by anything I like it 
Awesome stand got it along with the grill and its perfect for any outdoor events rather than having to set the grill up and take up space on a table Very sturdy no issues 
very nice 
slow delivery time great price worth the wait 
When I opened the packagelight at the campsite I realized the magnet had unstuck from the body rendering it useless only a visual inspection was done prior Luckily I had some tape to hold them together and was able to improvise Otherwise there was no complaints operationally I strongly recommend that you physically check the item and check it before reaching the campsite 
I have owned this light for many many years now I transport it in an old wool sock to protect the lense When I am assembling my tent I am sure to install this on the inner part of the tent before I attach the fly and usually put it about 18 inches above where my head will be when sleeping or reading This way I can turn the light onoff without sitting up I use rechargeable batteries and I rarely need to change them even over the entire summer season However I dont leave it on for more than an hour usually as that is about the longest I will stay awake at night reading once in the tent I have a mesh inner tent surface so I am always careful to not attach the magnetic plate until I know where I want the light exactly I have 4 different tents and have never had any issues with this light at all and I highly recommend it 

My son put this on his wish list Weve owned one for years  years its looking a bit rough but still works great My son loves his Wish it had wheels 
Should be no stars Cooler arrived with a dent in the lid We decided to ignor it and went camping We put of drinks food and perishables in added 20 ice and latched the top down and I were very surprised that the ice was TOTALLY melted after only 6 hours We had to make daily trips for ice What a camping bummer Might be ok for indoor party cooler but not outside 

Sturdy kept our food cold for days with ice replenishment It works much better than a plastic cooler Very happy with the product 
Finally a cooler that holds ICE It lasted 3 days with ICE Perfect 
Works as promised 
I purchased a pair of these sleeping bag liners after purchasing the bundle monster fleece liners I have to say that just having a slightly longer bag and the Coleman zipper they put on it makes it worth the purchase I used this liner in my Coleman 0F20F mummy bag for hammock camping and it helps to take you from outdoor camping to that feeling of snuggling in your warm bed at home The coldest temps we were in was 41F But I think we would have been comfortable into the mid 20s for sure We did have on flannel bottoms wool socks and sweat jacket so we were nice and toasty The bundle monster liner is short and frustrating If you want to get out of it quickly early in the morning you better plan ahead It will fight you I tried to use the bundle monster liner alone in my house at 73F and was so cold I had to get a blanket to put inside to keep me warm enough Also this fleece liner doesnt retain as much static as the bundle monster liner does I have already washed it a couple times and it hasnt shed much at all in the dryer Overall I would say Im an average temperature sleeper 5 7 and 160lbs This was one of the best purchases I have made We will get our moneys worth out of them 
Toasty 1 in package 
The bag is for mild temperatures I was not comfortable at 51Deg F Does have a nice feel and is light weight 
Extra layer of warmth for cold nights 
I bought this light for a backpacking trip It worked great but I will admit that it is heavy for backpacking Overall the batteries lasted all week and it stayed in place on my tent so it was worth the money 
great light Magnets allow you to have it hanging from the topceiling of your tent if you want small compact yet plenty bright enough for my small 2 man tent 
This lamp is easily installed on your tent It doesnt throw the kind of bright white light that can be a little jarring think of those cars with the superbright headlights this light is more a creamy yellow gentler on the eyes If you have a small tent it will work well Larger tents will need two or more lamps The lamp does feel heavy for its size due to the 4 AA batteries and the two magnets The magnets are very powerful dont store this near any credit cards or other items that would be affected by the magnetism Also I recommend putting something thin cardboard fabric swatch between both sides of the magnet to protect the fabric of your tent When you remove the magnet you have to pivot the metal attachment piece and Im afraid that if I do that repeatedly it will degrade the tent in that spot 
Price is good but really really thin metal I havent used yet but Im afraid a hot campfire would burn through this I could be wrong though For the price however you get what you pay for 
Cheap set you get what u pay for Hard to cleanus an SOS pad 
This is a really good starterbasic campset  It is aluminumso it wont last very long if you scrub them with brillo pads so be warned  I wore some weak spots in one after just 20 uses and it ended up with a hole in that spot but i was using the green brillo pads too probably too aggressive for the aluminum If you wash by hand with a cloth which i did for the first 10 uses I would expect these to last for a while I do NOT recommend putting these in the dishwasher bad things happened after just one time in mine surface started pitting and came out with what appears to be dried food but turned out to be some kind of coating flaking off that didnt take well to the heated dry cycle in my dish washer The coffee mug is a little small but its also compact and fits inside which is nice and would not be possible if it was bigger Since these are lightweight aluminum they will dent pretty easily but thats the nature of the lightweight aluminum not something bad about this product Otherwise ive been happy with this set I bought a second one if that tells you anything 
wow the bad reviews are so funny learn how to cook idiots I have cooked eggs steak chicken bacon and even made some tortillas One thing get two so you can cook two things at once Oh and have saved tons on gas too pan heats up instantly Actually used it to boil water the last trip talk about fast put my jet boil to shame 
great to use over a camp fire or propane grill easy to clean also 
Cheap camping buy 
Sturdy keeps stuff cold for a long time I used it on a recent trip 2 hours from my house The ice was still frozen when I arrived and still had ice the next morning It stayed cold for 2 days even with opening and closing pulling out stuff and adding things 
This light has a very powerful magnet which makes it stick to the tent and stay in place I had to have my husband put it on becuase my arthritic hands could not seperate the magnets The light is not really bright enough for it to be as useful as it could be but it still serves its purpose It worked great for a nightlight for my younger daughter who does not like the dark when camping and it did not bother my older daughter who likes to have complete dark to get asleep The fact that it settled that argument made it worth the purchase 
This light is nice because you can position it pretty much anywhere but its only bright enough to navigate a dark tent and not step on someone This is not a reading light or even a light to play cards by And bc its battery operated its not a good night light Maybe great in a tiny 1 person tent where you could have it inches from your facereading material but not in a family size tent 
Outstanding product reasonably priced and expeditiously shipped 
boy scout kit 
I bought four of these to take in our camper I loved them until the zippers broke on two of them this happened when we were zipping two together I was very sad this happened because the first few times we used them they worked perfectly 
I went out to test some outdoor gear recently I brought multiple sleeping bags and a thermometer to test temperatures These are pretty much garbage Coleman states these have a 50 degree comfort rating Thats crap I was wearing full clothing on a camping trip long sleeve top base layer short sleeve top over that base layer pants hiking pants over that thick wool socks a thick vest a jacket and a wool cap I was also on an insulated sleeping pad and inside a tent I was comfortable in the campsite moving around a little at 55 degrees I got ready for bed and the temperature was exactly 50 according to my outdoor thermometer I was freezing and couldnt fall asleep I got out of this and into a snugpak jungle bag also rated to 50 degrees and was MUCH more comfortable As thin fleece wind will blow right through them I used these outside one other time I zipped two together and lounged in a hammock with my girlfriend Temperatures got to about 60 degrees maybe the high 50s with windchill and we went inside because we were cold I didnt want that to be the only test these blankets got so I brought them on a gear testing trip last weekend I bought 4 of these sleeping bags a pair for emergency bags in case of flooding or house fires and a pair for the car for picnics and such and I will be donating them and replacing these with sleeping bagsblankets that do what they claim Snugpak makes blankets and bags that are far superior and similarly priced The snugpak jungle bag has removable netting over the face to keep bugs away two can be zipped together its water resistent its antimacrobial it breathes really well and it comes in a high quality compression sack 
I ordered these because I wanted something I could use in the summer and a way to make a sleeping bag warmer They are basically just fleece in the shape of a sleeping bag with a zipper They compress well and weight about the same as my down sleeping bag It actually compresses better than my down sleeping bag 
My favorite warm weather bag for summer time camping Its versatile and can be unzipped for use as a blanket by the fire or you can put a couple together for a double bag When its just a little too cold for my intermediate bag but I dont want to use the 0 degree mummy Ill just add this to the outside of the intermediate bag to add 15 degrees to it Zippers are robust and easily put together at night with the oversized plastic tabs Its self contained with an elastic loop for easy stowage 
It worked great when cooking eggs Very lightweight The handle that folds up has an angle so you can get it easer 
Ok for price dont get it too hot The coating came off quick 
Decent Definitely not non stick though Heats up extremely fast on a butane burner though because its thin and light 
A great Nonstick fry pan foto include with your camp cookset or in your backpack Well made not super light but not overbearing in a backpack 
I purchased two of these for use in a Boy Scout Troop I couldnt believe how shaky they were when I first set them up  there is literally no support for the tree except where the bases rests against the tank Probably the third time we used them we had one set up near some tables the Scouts were sitting at when one of the boys swung around and hit the tube with his arm  not terribly hard either The plastic knob at the bottom sheared off and a jet of propane shot out six feet before the tanks cutoff engaged I have thrown both these hazards away and would never recommend them to anyone OSHA would have a fit if they knew abut this products safety problem 
I have a pair of these 30 inchdistribution trees and have found them helpful in getting my North Star lantern up high enough to allow me to see what Im cooking on my propane stove Still 30 inches is a bit short for illuminating a camping area though once perched on top of a propane tank these stalks are close to the right height Being able to run multiple propane devices from a single tank is a nice convenience and I have not had any issues with the valves or connections after several years of use However one issue that gives me pause is the tendency for the tree to tilt or sway a bit because the kickstand that secures it on the tank seems to work itself loose Also I think these trees are bit pricey for what you getat the very least Coleman could throw in a canvas sling bag for storing and hauling I did not pay anywhere close to this price for either of mine scoring the second one for 1 at a yard sale 
Nice looking cooler I had it latched and forgot and gently pulled up the lid and the entire locking attachment on the inside came out Pretty sure thats not supposed to happen I was always a true beliver in Coleman products but after this last camping tripnot so much 
well made does its job UGA fan so love the colors 
There are better high stands out there This one is a very expensive garbage bag holder for me It was too flimsy for anything else 
My 3 burner Coleman campstoves feet fit perfectly between the top bars Snug fit makes this stand feel more sturdy considering the construction Light portable and quick to pack Propane will hang in the air though Would be even better if the legs had adjustments just in case the camp ground is not perfectly flat 
I bought two of these last year and was very pleased that I did I especially like the convenience of attaching it to the inside of my tent and when needed simply switch it on Yeah No more fumbling with flashlights or lanterns We put the other one on our gazebo which worked out really well too If I had to say anything negative that would be it is not really bright but quite honestly I dont need bright when camping 
I feel like I am camping 
fine simple vup rather nice as it can also be used to heat individual hot drink 
Its a cup Lightweight and better than reusing plastic bottles Its nice to have a coffee cup when your out backpacking over night 
great 
Flimsy 
Great product Basically a fleece blanket plus zipper Compact lightmedium weight 
lightweight use only during warm summer nights 
Nice fleeces Ive had this type of item before and it really does give another 1020 degrees of comfort The zippers look good too The only down side is youre not able to choose you colors Other than that nice product 
My grandson is a warm sleeper so I bought this for his first camp out with us this summer It is very light but warm enough that with his pajamas and this on a foam cushion he was plenty warm I also will use it for our ladies retreats when we are in indoor cabins that are too warm for regular sleeping bags I also appreciate that this can just be tossed into the washer and dryer 
This thing is crazy heavy when full of beer and ice but a single strong person can lift it by themselves and carry it from the car to the pool Love the material and the look even heftier people can sit on it without breaking it The lock isnt a lock at all dont even try to lift this sideways or upside down when theyre stuff inside the lid will come off instantly All it does is add a bit of extra rubber friction to the lid to make it difficult for small children or sufficiently drunk fools to open No wheels makes it pain on long carries but no wheels means the wheels dont break or get covered in sand so thats a plus I love this cooler 
The product works so far but its pretty much obsolete now Meaning everything now is LED powered which are incredibly light and compact This guy is bulky very heavy with the batteries and magnet and the light is pretty dim I have an LED flashlight which is powered by watch batteries that is far brighter than this light and it is the size of a large pen This light takes 4 AA batteries and still gives off a pretty dim light And did I mention its bulky and heavy Hey the light works the magnet is strong and it does the job but Ill bet if it already doesnt exist someone will come out with an LED tent light that is far brighter and much less bulky Id recommend this light only for car camping and just for basic lighting needs not for reading 
The pan was a great deal for camping i enjoy the outdoors and its so easy to handle and light 
Ignore all people that have bad experences with this product I got this item from Walmart because I need 3 of them for a camping trip First off the size is very nice and the weight is great The non stick is so nice to have easy cleaning I use 3 of these pans 4 times a day for a week durning our camping trip cooking everything from steak eggs and veggies also ways a great pan I do not know how they are with gas burners and they could be to much but never tryed that I had all these on Open flame driect on coals and when with flames and coals combined I dont know how these other users are using them but I can say there doing it wrong Over all great pan I am happy with them and using them 28 times so far and still looks new They are good 
Well first off if you are using a blow torch type stove like the pocket rocket on a fry pan well good luck youll need it  I picked up this pan the other day for my kitchen pack For less then 10 bucks For kicks I looked here to see the reviews Ha and what the My only thoughs were some people should learn how to fry at home before trying it in the field Medhigh heat with a stove that has a flame the right size for the pan or KEEP THE PAN MOVING So I just tried this pan on a Walleye I caught this morning A little Olive oil and a touch of butter Im glad the pan has sides or the fish would have slid off the pan The pan worked flawlessly  Im sure I could take my blow torch backpack stove and burn this pan but I dont call that cooking This pan is stamped steel Not aluminum 
Not the most sturdy stand but is extremely compact and works well for car camping It does not lock into place when opened Use small tent stakes to help keep it stable 
Reasonably sturdy I added a piece of colorplast with a couple of screws to fit in the top channels of the stand to act as a tabletop 
light and strong Easy to store and use 
If you have the room just get a table with a top This works okay but the joints are plastic and I have my doubts about durability 
This is part of our emergency kit Just like I remember from girl scouts 
I got this to test out for my scout troop We wont be using these The materials are too light and fragile Not for serious use 
good 
This is a very nice little aluminum mess kit very comoact kit and very useful Same basic design you might remeber from scouts You might want to get a utensile set as well to complete the kit 
Plan to use kit for emergency food prep 
impatal 
Really enjoy camping 
one for the back pack and one for the truck thats the way i role 
love the lock 
Took this camping with temps in the upper 90s and feels like temps in the 100s and it held ice for several days This was our beverage cooler and was opened probably 15 times daily and was left in the bed of the truck We did purchase another bag of ice on the 3rd day because the 2 bags we had put in there were almost completely melted Considering the heat  how much this was used we are super happy 
I used this cooler the first weekend I went out After 4 days the original ice I put in it was still there when I came home Yes a lot of it was melted but a lot of ice still remained and all the rest of my food and drinks were still cold I love it 
I just love clever camping gadgets This inexpensive light worked great in our tent We put in right inside the tent door and found it to be very conventient Easy enough for the kids to use 
Coleman makes good products but this is more of a novelty item The magnet feature is cool as you can virtually locate the magnet anywhere on your tent surface easier to do with two people by placing the magnet bar on the outside and light inside The Xenon bulb puts out enough light to see what you are doing in your tent I have a small twoman Eureka tent but it definitely is not a reading light source The four AA batteries that it needs will last for a good long weekend but probably not a week Also keep in mind that it weighs about ten ounces with batteries if you are backpacking However its a lot safer than a candle or a hot Coleman lantern I would suggest a small penlight would suffice for rough backpacking 
The Coleman Tent Light is a great idea This wedgeshaped light is backed with two powerful magnets and a removeable metal mounting plate Take the mounting plate off put the light wherever you want to in your tent put the mounting plate on the outside of your tent behind the light and viola You now have light and it easily clicks on and off with one hand which is important when camping The magnets are strong enough to mount the light to either horizontal or verticle surfaces It takes AA batteries and its easy to get the unit apart to put the batteries in or replace them In fact its too easy and that is one of my complaints The magnets are so poweful that pretty much anytime I take the mounting plate off the light comes apart too I guess its not that big a deal but seems to me that it just could have been designed to avoid that Things that continually fall apart have that cheap feel to them and thats not what I want to feel when Im in the middle of the woods I want to have confidence in my gear My second complaint is that the light is also not that bright I put this in a fourperson tent and it was just a little more dim than I would have preferred It was certainly bright enough to see and get ready for sleep this is not going to be a reading lamp though Allallall this is not a bad product and Im happy I have it for the price at which it was sold I just wonder if there maybe isnt something a little better out there 
oh yeah 
I bit wiggly and the stove set on top can fall through if not placed in the exact centered position I have made a supporting surface of light plywood to place on the table to help secure the stove Lightweight compact good price 
I RARELY give bad reviews but this is the worst grilling stand ever Absolutely no support and thanks to the adjustable nature of this beast it just lets your grill fall right through with the slightest touchnot a good thing when your grill is lit and has the potential to start a fire We got the Coleman PerfectFlow Insta Start Grill Stove which is a fairly large grill for its class but the skinny rubber parts on this stand are just on the legs that extend across the top and really dont hold the grill well unless you have a really tiny  light grill None the less its REALLY easy to tip this thing over The whole thing is incredibly wobbly which is my main concern when my husband tried to imitate turning the grill on in our living room by turning the knobs no propane attached it caused the whole thing to collapse and since then Ive tried to get the width of the stand just right that it doesnt cause the entire grill to go crashing to the ground but havent had any luck I really wanted this thing to work and gave it every chance but it is very flawed and I cant imagine the danger for kids running around it I wish we would have just put our money towards an extra fold up aluminium table like the table in a bag that thing is awesome and versatile excellent for cards or eating dinner with 4 people Its not perfect stability but MUCH better than the coleman stand I own them both and you have to sacrifice a little stability for comparability 
Excellent 
Used this pan on 2 or 3 camping trips and its completely worthless after just a halfdozen meals I know its cheap but it should last longer than it did Everything sticks to it and the resultant residue is practically impossible to remove 
This pan is a fine example of JUNK I tried to cook an egg on the one we had That was the end of the pan Even with a bit of oil the egg never came off the pan A big disappointment coming from Coleman 
Same experience as above  food burned in it and could not be removed The socalled nonstick coating is anything but The pan is very light and does not disperse heat very well which granted one expects from a light weight aluminum pan Folding handle is a very nice touch In all  Great design lousy execution 
This pan wasnt nonstick The food sausage stuck to it at medium heat and left a burnt black residue that wouldnt come off The residue caused the food to taste terrible This pan is now being stored in a landfill Dont waste your money 
Its like the kind of thin fleece blanket you throw over yourself when watching TV but with with a zipper I find this to be a great warm weather sleeping bag appropriate for an indoor sleep over or glamour camping 
Great sleeping bag Its very light weight so if you are using it inside during the summer its fine but during the winter or outside will require another blanket Rolls up very small  compact 
comfortable little bag for when you want to tote a blanket somewhere but not take up a lot of space 
I use this sleeping bag liner as a light blanket in warm weather and it gets pretty hot here in South Carolina so a heavy blanket is not needed at night The liner is made of a nice soft fleece that is both warm and comfortable Would be a great asset to tenters who camp in warm weather and need something to just take the cool night air off Comes with its own carrying case and rolls up into a very small package Its light weight and takes up very little room when stored 
I bought this bag about a year ago and in that time Ive used it both as a bag by itself and as a fleece liner I love using it as an indoor bag and as a fleece liner but even during summer Im from Northern Utah I get a little cold when this this is all I use were talking minimum temperatures around 60 degrees Fahrenheit I do love the zipper plow though and I also really like the compact size So in summary if camping outside I would probably only count on using it as a liner forwith another bag but it is awesome to have for travel and I think its definitely worth the price 
I used this instead of a sleeping bag when it got into the 60s at night It was the perfect amount of warmth and smaller than my too warm bag 
Decent and light weight for the price 
Emergency prep gear Have used once with good success 
Very lightweight and great for backpacking 
Its a nice set 
These are not the same heavy duty version that was made in the USA back in the day This one is made in China and is much thinner It still works but I like my Open Country campware messkit better than this Coleman for about the same price 
This will hold my Coleman stove just wish it was a little more sturdy 
Light weight and holds my stove perfect 
Arrived on time Excellent purchase Operates as advertised 
Works great 
I like these lights quite a bit We do not hang them in the middle of the tent though so I cant attest to it lighting up a whole tent plus our tent is big 15x12 We use these right above where we sleep in the tent for reading etc They hold well and dont pull on the tent too much We use rechargeable batteries in them too so I dont know how fast they go through regular batteries and each takes 4 AA so rechargeables would be a good idea And yes the lights are an oval shape just as an FYI They have a rubberized push button onoff on the side and the batteries are easy to put in and take out 
This is a really nice piece of camping kit as it clips with the magnet to any part of your tent in seconds Its got a pretty strong magnet bar which goes on the outside of your tent and the metal bracket of the light anchors it on the inside At first I wondered if the tight contact of the light would cause the tent to leak and so far the answer has been a very clear and dry no on many tents of different fabric The light is incandescent inside a traditional sealed bulb I have had no problem with the light or bulb in the 4 years Ive owned this light The lens diffuses the light nicely so if you put this light at the crown of your tent you will have light throughout My only problem with this unit is that its kind of big and bulky Its not that heavy even with the four AA batteries installed but its kind of large In a camping world in which weve got windup LED systems and increasingly smaller lights which provide more and more light I would think that an uptechd version of this light could be smaller and throw out more light If youre doing backwoods trekking where every ounce counts this is probably not the solution you need But if youre doing family camping car camping or going to camps that have existing tents summer camps scout camps then this is a really fantastic piece of gear  Update 24 July 2008 Now about a year on here are additional comments on this product It continues to function just fine but I have one complaint I do not store this unit with batteries in it so each time I go camping I open the case to install and then later remove the batteries The case opens by way of gently pinching the two sides together at the lamps waist between the onoff switch and the lower magnetic housing There are no locks screws springs or mechanical latches the two parts of the lamp are kept together only by the plastic flex of the upper lamp housing itself After a year of easy and careful use the upper plastic housing around the pinch points has started to crack The unit still works just fine I just got back from a week in the woods but its only a matter of time now until the housing splits or a large chunk of the plastic comes off preventing the unit from coming together and thereby ruining it  Update 26 May 2009 The cracks at the waist are slightly bigger and slowly growing The light still works fine and just served me well on yet another campout but the day is coming when that plastic housing breaks permanently and this light will be finished  Update 8 October 2010 Another spring and summer gone and this light continues to soldier on Its still got its original bulb and all other original parts No corrosion no rust inside or out No clouding of the plastic lens The cracking of the waist area I mention above has stabilized somewhat with no plastic pieces having come off It still works great and itll be with me into another fall and winter of Scout camping  Update 2 June 2011 Getting ready for another campout this weekend and this light is packed and ready to go No changes since the last update still working just fine  Update 19 October 2012 Man a perfect score for helpful votesthank you all This was an easy review to write for what has turned out to be a great product I just broke it out of the attic for a camping trip tomorrow evening and with four AA batteries dropped in it still works like a charm There is no further degradation to the plastic no flaking discoloration cracks or pieces coming off It is not brittle but still gives nicely and came apart and went back together just as easily as any time before Itll be lighting my tent tomorrow night as it has on so many nights before I see that there is anbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefColemanLEDtentlightdpB004E4GB1UrefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTF8Coleman LED tent lightanbspnow for about 8 more I have not seen one in person nor tried one out but if Coleman has applied the same characteristics to this new light as they did for this one itll be a winner 
This is my camp cup As in I take it with me when we go camping at my familys camp in PA I could never keep my cup straight from everyone elses so I got this one Its an excellent size big enough to hold a full cup of coffee with room to spare reducing the possibility of a spill nonbreakable so great for travel and the heat from the coffee keeps your hands warm WARNING because this is a metal cup if the coffee is TOO hot you will have to just use the handle or do like I do and pull your sleeve down and use it like a potholder  The other advantage of the metal is that I can set it close to the fire and keep my coffee warm but again be careful its not too hot 
This is no fishing boat cooler The main reason I purchased this item is because of the design and color Kudos to Coleman for understanding that their customers appreciate great looking design as much utility The vintage look rounded lid steel hardware bottle opener and the cool colors will look fantastic whether youre having a pool party glamping in your canned ham or icing down Dom Perignon on your vintage yacht I ordered the rose and its stunning 
Great cooler Latch is great Hinges great Sloped internal drain Rubberized bottom Great cooler 
it is altight thought it be better 
Great product As advertised 
Great for camping or for cooking over a trash can if you get kicked out of your house Reliable easy to clean A must have for any man 
A 
These are perfect for a small backpack set up I also filled them with tea lights and cotton to take up all the extra room and noise that they can make 
okay 
Awesome lightweight stand I carried two bungee cords with me to wrap around the legs to hold it tight to keep my grill from falling Otherwise there is a potential for your grill to fall off because the stand doesnt clip onto it in any way 
A new and improved design from my original and quite old Coleman stand Adjustable side to side and fore and aft Feet have holes in them so you can spike it to the ground I would recommend it 
Wobbly but works 
The zipper is shorter than the actual bag length so it pulls the bag unevenly on the zipper side other than that its not bad for 50 F degree weather 
I love these great lightweight sleeping bag for summer time use So many uses at a good price I unzip these and use while sitting on my sofa when I get chilly or throw them on my bed if I need an extra blanket If something happens to either of the 2 I bought I will be buying again I am 210 lbs 62 and especially like the size of these 
A thin fleece sleeping bag was recommended by my sons boy scouts leaders for summer camp because it dries out easily and also because skin doesnt stick to fleece the way it would to some of the sleeping bag fabrics so I ordered this one on Amazon It isnt a very soft fleece which is why Im only giving it 4 stars but I think it is because it is tightly woven which makes it good for a liner or an additional sleeping bag cover I sent my son with a sheet too in case it bugged him but he thought it was perfect It looked just as nice after a week of cot camping as it did when it arrived nothing was stuck or embedded in the fleece and he did say when it got a little wet from rain it was dry much faster than some of his friends Its a keeper 
Decent blanket Daughter used it for camping inside sleeping bag and liked it 
chips to easy 
I use it with an induction hot plate to heat water for tea Works good but the whole cup get hot  handle rim and all So be careful 
Kept our food cold for three days of camping Instead of loose ice I used frozen bottles of water for an odor and mess free cleanup Love it 
We bought this for use on our halogen stove top for pancakes but you could use it on any surface Seems to be good quality And is nicely made 
everything stuck to it Bought for making pancakes didnt do the job 
Have had two of these griddles They warped easily Go with a TFal griddle for about 30 Much better quality same size deeper sides about 1 deep compared to about 14 on this Coleman and better handles The nonstick surface on the first one we owned got trashed when I overcooked some eggs and underapplied sufficient oil Get the TFal 
This griddle doesnt have a very good nonstick finish It is hard to clean  easily scuffed using a noscratch pad Once the surface is scuffed everything you cook on it will stick no matter how much oil you use It is the perfect size to fit over 2 burners of over a camp stove or 2 RV burners Probably too small for household use 
I bought this tent light for my first camping trip upon positive reviews on Amazon At the time my choice was between this and a more traditional design lantern This light is very wellbuilt But in retrospect a lantern would have been more useful Pros 1 Compact  about the size of a burrito Much slimmer than most traditional lanterns 2 Uses AA batteries The large battery in most lanterns costs about 10 a pop This one has slots for four AA batteries but as the other reviewer noted 2 will work Cons 1 Light is quite dim 2 In case you are deciding between this one and a more tradtional lantern consider this This light is useless outside the tent Well its not meant to be since its a tent light But if plan to cook and eat after its dark and you want to pack just one light get a lantern I tried putting this light on the table it simply doesnt light up enough space around it For this light to be useful it has to be installed in a higher up position The chance of you finding a suitable objectsurface to attach this light to outdoor is almost zero 
nice 
Much smaller overall than I expected based on the photos The cup is really small This is definitely a single serving kit Youre not going to cook for yourself and someone else but for a solo meal this works Takes up almost no room and is light as a feather Stackable and locks together to keep everything in one place I ordered 2 of these and they take up almost no room and even less weight to your bugout bag 
You get what you pay for although that means less and less Given the price I wasnt expecting a whole lot but I was still somewhat disappointed I have a 20 year old version of this kit and was looking to get a second for my wife In those couple of decades quality of manufacturing has gone down considerably This is very lightweight construction I guess thats good for your back but Id gladly carry a few more ounces to make this kit more rugged Also the dimensions are not quite right so it doesnt pack up tight so I had to bend out the plate to make room for the pot If youre looking for a cheap in every sense backup or a spare this could work for you Otherwise it might be worth shelling out a few more bucks for a higher quality product 
This is the cheapest most rink dink mess kit Ive ever come across I bought it because it had 4 stars average rating Maybe because I am previous military and used their rugged mess kits for so long this looks like a piece of junk Everything is very small too The aluminum is so thin one drop or too heavy of an item in it could easy destroy this piece of junk 
I bought two for use as sleeping bag liners Temperatures dropped below 50 at night and these liners made all the difference At first we used them as blankets over our sleeping bags but we were so cold that finally we put them inside our sleeping bags as they are intended and that made a huge difference I only wish they had sent me 2 different colors rather than 2 of the same color to help distinguish them 
Decent bag for the price My only complaint is the zipper setup makes it very difficult to put two bags together Might have been my stupidity but thats the reason for only three stars Otherwise a nice lightweight bag 
We were a little disappointed in these stands They are very wobbly and we found that if we put 2 of them side by side and didnt open them all the way we could put our 3 burner Coleman stove on them and they were OKnot great but useable 
Used this on a two week camping trip and it saved my back over and over 
worked great for our coleman stove 
it took the camp stove off the ground but you had to be careful that stove didnt slide off 
Held ice for nearly 2 days at a time while strapped to a trailer exposed to the sun and heat on a cross country summer trip This is made very solid for the money you would be hard pressed to find a better value 
excellent 
In an age when your choice is a 300 deluxe model or a 1495 piece of junk from your local discount store this cooler remains an icon for a good reason It works and it holds up Period As a Scout leader camper hunter and fisherman Ive used about every cooler there is out there and after yard saling the rest this is the one I kept Get one in a color you like  itll be around as long as you are 
ordered 2 cups and both have a spot at bottom of cup that has no enamel coating Both spots now have a look that appears to be rust Hope they dont eventually rust completely through or begin to chip off Maybe this is due to the way they have to be manufactured but it would be if they were completely enameled Other than that I have no problem Also ordered 2 24oz cups and they are the same 
its OK Its smaller than I thought 
Bought for camping but use for daily morning coffee Great little cup 
Perfect campfire companion Goes great with the Coleman percolator The enamel does a decent job of keeping the mug insulated long enough to enjoy a cup in the mornings The way I do it is to fill it about 23 of the way full drink it down to about 13 and refill it back to 23 This keeps a fresh supply of hot on top and keeps the temp right Review update I received these 090914 After unpacking them and preparing them for the initial wash I found that one was slightly dinged or dented on the bottom This had caused the enamel to chip away on both the outside of the mug and the inside I contacted Amazon via chat and within about 10 minutes the issue was resolved One of the main reason I deal with Amazon REGULARLY and preferably  they take care of their customers Ive only had a couple of issues with orders through Amazon over the past years and each time they immediately and satisfactorily resolved them 
We own a pair of these and just purchased two more for our children They are great for camping because though they lose their heat quickly in cool weather as any uncovered mug would they can be popped right over the fire to heat up We use them for cold beverages as well 
Ehhh Not sure about this thing yet it seems pretty wobbly Im definitely gonna get something to go on top as a tablelike surface then set the stove on it I just dont trust the stand on its own But it seems it will do what I need getting the stove off the ground Time will tell 
I was thinking of putting my new Coleman 2 burner stove on this but when I got both was not happy and this stand does not offer any degree of stability The stove just rest on top and it all seems pretty rickety I could just see cooking something on the stove on this thing and a mild bump and over it would go with hot pans boiled liquid and dinner splashing everywhere I just ended up putting the stove on the picnic table 
Got two of them Great for all kinds of uses I like the way they fold up small but can be spread apart to support a nice table top We use a piece of Corian countertop which is pretty light and easily supports hard use 
Comes in a compact design folded up nicely and easy to pack I just spent 5 days camping with this and had my two burner stove on it the whole time Initial setup was easy it is a little flimsy as some people say but I didnt extend it the whole way and put a thin piece of wood under the two front legs to level it off I always have thin pieces of wood to level off my tables etc I tested this out with two stoves a metal suitcase we use to hold utensils etc and a coleman grill All fit on it nicely the grill was a little top heavy and I probably wouldnt use it for that type of equipment my goal was to use with our metal suitcase to save my back but it was so cool and perfect for my stove I used it there You must use your head and adjust the width to your equipment its extremely versatile I love this thing and buying a second one to leave a table at home I may buy a third  they are so compact and I want a back up just in case I do agree that it could use have a strap to hold it together when folded up otherwise Im going to glue a velco strap to it 
I bought this for use as legs for a camping table If you cut a 18 x 24 piece of wood plywood or use multiple smaller boards this is a great base for your camp table It is light weight and packs very small 
Ok its cheap If you want stable stake it to the ground and get something that will brace the long sides of the stand There is nothing to stop the accordian from coming together There are stablizer bars across both short ends as you can see in the picture Also in the picture you can see there is nothing to keep the stand from collapsing inward Notched dowel rods and some type of platform for the top fixes thisor just by something that does the job Weight does seem to stablize it  heavier  less it wobble Ill keep it without modifications and use it for my cooler 
Bends easy but bends right back They took a beating and I got a lot of use out of them I lost them one by one else I think Id still use them now 
Perfect for my Scouts 
For the price this is a fantastic cook kit for my purposes I do a lot of backpacking in NY mountains so thats the context of my usage I use this kit with annbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefMSRPocketRocketStovedpB00E1I36Q2refcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTF8MSR PocketRocket Stovea Ive used this kit for about 3 years I try to avoid cooking on the trail as much as possible just for the sake of convenience but in the cold weather its really nice to have a warm meal and a warm cup of coffee So I cant speak to this products usefulness for trail gourmands My goto meal for backpacking is couscous This is how it works out 1 Pour one 6oz box of couscous and seasoning in the skillet with 14 of TVP sometimes plus some olive oil 2 Boil water in the lidded pot 3 Pour boiling water over couscous as much as can fit is perfect 4 Stir 5 Cover with bowllid and then cover with bandana Colder weather  More insulation 6 Wait 5 minutes 7 Eat And Im left with only one vessel the skillet that needs real cleaning I use the pot for boiling water only This means that I never have to scrub it out on the trail and that my morning coffee wont taste like garlic couscous The plastic handle on the pot lid is a nice improvement over the metal lid handle on older sets Its nice to have a separate cup instead of drinking out of an allpurpose pot Allows me to have a hot drink while eating a warm meal and  again  a drink that doesnt taste like a previous meal Pros 1 The four separate vessels may seem antiminimalist but the convenience is worth it 2 Light as light can be 3 Heats up very quickly 4 Packs together neatly 5 Dont abuse it and it lasts for many years 6 Inexpensive Cons 1 Aluminum cup will burn your mouth if filled with very hot liquid The metal conducts the heat too well Ive found that putting a small piece of electrical tape where my lips meet the cup solves this but it must be reapplied before each trip Consider replacing with plastic cup 2 Along those lines it does not hold heat well Youll want to put something beneath it and cover it with a bandana or something assuming your food has to sit off the flame for awhile before eating 3 No carrying case included I tie it up in a bandana and then use the bandana as a potholderinsulator when I eat 4 The material is delicate If this goes in the bottom of your backpack all day it will get bent and dented The good news is that its easy enough to bend back in to shape to some extent For me this is perfect But it depends on your cooking style and your needs Either way definitely worth considering 
It seems a bit flimsy and that it could easily be damaged A once in a while camper it would probably be okay more dedicated campers should look for something more sturdy 
Good mess kit nice and light If you just want to make food for yourself this is good but for any more than one or maaybe two people the mess kit is too small I recommend taking a rubber band to hold it all together in your pack so it doesnt fall apart but otherwise good product 
good size 
Okay but not as well made as what I bought from the local Boy Scouts Council Store 
My previous steelbelted Coleman cooler lasted 30 years and it got used all the time This one looks even sturdier and I expect it to go 30 plus years as well Best cooler out there 
Great cooler holds ice for a few days 
This looks really nice love the black wish it did come with a bottle opener like the other blue one but it still looks great Also keeps cold for about 2 12 days 
This thing is sturdy It easily handles my stove or my large cooler or anything else that will fit on it Its compact and folds up easily to store in a small space until you need it again Great asset to any campsite 
Fits the stove fine as pictured but they leave off the fuel canister It cannot just hang in midair Will have to use it close to another table so the canister has something to rest on Also the stove legs dont really fit snug into anything they just rest there and it seems as if with the rounded edges of my stove the slightest bump will cause it to slip through at any time I will not be using it unless I find a piece of wood to make it into a table top that would hold the canister and keep the stove from slipping through It is a bit wobbly 
The pot handle is very flimsy and caused me to spill boiling water on the ground several times granted this was after a 15 mile hike and my buddy and I werent in the mood to delicately balance things Otherwise its what you would expect I mean what did you expect from this cheap thing anyway Its thin aluminum Did its job and nothing more 
Awesome for the price Quality is what you would expect at least what I used to get years ago and nowadays often lacks Just keep in mind that this is supposed to be thin aluminum AND check the sizes  It is small I expected something much bigger 
Exactly what I hoped for Mine came with an aluminum cup and an extra plate Many people burn holes in these and warp them They are AlUmInUm Use a small fire or scrape coals to the side You dont need alot 
compact and sturdy 
Great for hiking light weight 
It is what is  okay 
Love it 
The enamel chipped off through normal wear and tear after a few uses and I threw it out 
Love these Simple old fashioned enamel ware that brings back memories of camping as a kid 
Grandparents had the original for over 30 years new one is a bit different but I like it works for what I need 
My 10 year old used it at camp in his sleeping bag Kept him cozy all night Zips right up in sleeping bag 
Wish if packed a little smaller 
Big but light Will do well when a full sleeping bag is not required 
The bag isnt as thick as you may think from looking at the image Make sure youre sleeping on the beach or have a pad below it The way the bag folds up is oddtheres a partial pouch sown into the end of the bag it doesnt end up fitting the whole bag once you unpack it for the first time I would much rather the traditional straps at the end of the bag 
Oh man  this bag is excellent two of the same  zip together  plenty of room for two adults could probably fit a 3rd 28deg nights  not one chill  excellent bag Rolls up nicely  easy 
I purchased this sleeping bag for my fiance as a birthday gift hes a big guy and so he loves it its nice and roomy and is nice and fluffy pretty big to pack in a backpack though so you backpackers may want to get something that rolls up smaller but for all you big folks out ther looking for a nice big comfy bag this ones for you 
This is the second time we have purchased this sleeping bag We wore out the last one and now the dogs sleep with it Comfy warm and best of all it doesnt slide around Coleman is always making excellent products and this is no exception  This is a above 20 degree sleeping bag that uses soft but tough cotton as the material and a good zipper that actually works As a bonus it makes a good mattress on hot nights It is big enough that my 240 pound frame will fit comfy inside Well worth the bucks 
Ive owned several sleeping bags and none have been as comfortable as this one Ive never been a fan of those synthetic fabrics This bag is plenty warm very comfortable and doesnt slip and slide like synthetics 
easy to setup and holds the weight of my over2 burner cook stove only thing they need to add is a top for it 
Was completely surprised to find this on Amazon at a price FAR LESS than EBay Lesson learned there    some things on EBay Im finding are completely OVERpriced Also was pleasantly surprised when this turned out to be green anodized A bonus 
I have one from the 6070s its beat up real good but still works  I wanted to raise up a camp kitchen I have and this will be much more stabile than the other one Non skid surface on top is a real nice touch 
nice 
I purchased these for my daughter for her camping gear She had been looking for these and she loved them 
Nice cup if you are a camper or homeless in the subway looking for some financial help Cant put it in the dishwasher But what camper lugs a dishwasher along on the trip If you are a cityboy like me then you would waste a lot of time trying to find out where to plug in the tv Grampyz to 
Decent kit A simple all in one mess kit that I use in my camping and hunting adventures 
not bad but thought it be bigger 
little flimsy but good for any survival situation 
A classic 
Good product Good service 
This is perfect The people that are rating it badly must not have the right stove or not doing something right It folds up nicely  I wouldnt stand on it Amazon You are RIGHT ONas usual 
I use this quite a bit for ice fishing and I love it My only complaint is that when trainsporting it it doesnt stay folded up completely 
I ordered this because while I already had a collapsable stand for my stove I figured it would be nice to have one that was tall enough to cook on without having to bend over This stand opens and closes better than the one I already own but it is the same height And if you let it go it tends to collapse on its own Maybe when I get the additional weight of the stove on it this wont be a problem But it does tend to pull its legs in together if they have any opportunity to move themselves in towards the middle I was on concrete at the time so again this might not be as much of a problem on dirt But if I were engineering it Id provide some leg locks or simple pins to keep the table up in the high short position Hmmm Maybe I can add them Im 510 Tall people will need long arms to cook this low Im sure Amazon has them available Id give this three or four stars for cooler use assuming your cooler is itself somewhat tall 
The moment any gust of wind would hit this it would start to topple I tried using it as a stand for the burners but it was way to low I kept it and tried using it as a garbage bag holder but it always fell Yuck 
Ive used these stands for several years now for both my camping grill and stove When all is said and done they do work but you have to be very careful when using them On the plus side theyre very lightweight pack up small and are adjustable The problem is they are also a bit flimsy With no back or tabletop your grill or stove rests gingerly across two thin beams With the lid open and a propane tank attached most grills and stoves are already a far cry from balanced Toss in a rickety stand and some uneven ground and youve got a very hot balancing act on your hands A modest bump would be enough to send your stove or grill crashing to the ground Ive had a few close calls and Im generally pretty careful Had my grill fall once before it was lit Would recommend it only for those times where portability matters and theres nothing sturdier available to work with Have since bought anbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefColemanPackAwayKitchendpB00339912SrefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTF8Coleman PackAway Kitchena Its not perfect but the beams are definitely more secure and stable 
too warm and great fit 
Took on mission trip to Guatemala left sleeping bag in US due to warm nights in Guatemala When nights got a little cool I used a sheet with the fleece unzipped like a blanket and was comfortable all night I like the travel bag it comes in as well 
just ok 
I bought the turquoise Coleman Cooler last year at an unbelievable price locally It is so beautiful and retro looking I fell in love with it Thick insulation and convient plug for water to drain I cant imagine spending money on a YETI when this functions perfectly and looks like you went back to the 1950s when turquoise was the hottest color 
I like it but afterwards I found it at Cabelas for 895 Same exact one 
Smaller than I expected Accidentally dropped some bleach on one pan and now there is a chemical burn Be safe and dont get them too hot because aluminum will melt you arent supposed to cook directly on fire anyways I would not trust this anywhere near a rocket stove Compact and a good assortment Light weight Right pricing but clearly a cheep product If you are building a survival pack you might want to find something else Alternative Tip Drill two holes in a cake pan and use wire for a handle Find a thin sheet of metalwood or recycle a cheap top from a pot to utilize as a topcutting surface Cheap and light weight and all you would need You dont need a separate skillet or even a bowl and the cup in this set is tiny You can get a reliable steel canister with everything else at Walmart 
works great love it 

Nice big and loose bag The interior lining is not as soft as other bags from Coleman or others I have had but probably better quality and wont overheat on warmer nights I tried it on a 35 degree night without problems I did not find the bag to have an offensive smell as some other reviewers indicated The storage bag that comes attached to it is much better than straps or a loose bag in my opinion You just roll it up and cinch the strings 
Im always cold at night no matter how many blankets and purchased this sleeping bag so I can lower my heat and heating bills Its perfectthe flannel lining is soft and warm and theres plenty of room to move I can sleep comfortably without cranking up the heat I would not however use this sleeping bag outdoors except in the summerjust seems too lightweightbut for my own purposes its perfect 
I bought two of these after we bought a popup camper one for my daughter one for myself I previously had mummy style sleeping bags and the shape was just not for me We brought them to Yellowstone and the nightly temps there were around freezing We did wear lots of fleece and even stocking caps at night but the sleeping bags kept us nice and warm Since that trip weve been camping every weekend in normal weather 60s at night We usually open up our sleeping bags and use them as mattresses VERY thick and comfy or put one whole one on top of us the other on the bottom I think it would be WAY too hot to use it as a regular sleeping bag in these temps The zippers are solid on this bag We are constantly zipping and unzipping without any problems or snags weve camped about 20 nights using these so far The only issue someone might have is their sizethey are not for backpacking And I dont love the design for rolling them up many have mentioned this in other reviews Otherwise a great sleeping bag 
I am a boy scout and go on a lot of camp outs and using a mess kit is bothersome and herd to clean When I used this at a camp it was all that I expected and is very easy to clean I would recommend this 
I dont drink coffee but this reminds me of my dad and it is perfect to drink my whiskey out of while I camp 
Ive used this on 3 camping trips now and am very pleased It is very tough and easy to clean 
I have owned a number of these Coleman mugs for years In fact I have one that is over 12 years old that went on every hike I ventured on over those dozen years It has since been retied and enjoying the good life on a shelf These mugs are not the kind that will appeal to everyone for sure You have to have a real nostalgia thing going to enjoy it them or just like the feel of it over an open fire on a cold morning or evening Sure the handle gets hot if the coffee is really steaming but it dissipates quickly if used outdoors where it has always been in service with me The number of times I have used it at home over the fire place the hot handle has never bothered me since I dont get the coffee as hot as over a campfire As to some of the other more critical reviews of this about it chipping and peeling I think one of the fallacies about old time enamel mugs like these is that they are prit near indestructible which is not true Just because they are made of metal you cant toss them on a pile of rocks or expose them to all manner of rough weather Ive always treated mine like they are made of out glass and done just fine with them No doubt some of the reviewers here that had their mugs peel and whatnot were as careful as I am and still saw their mugs fail or fall apart way too fast All I can tell you is that the number I have owned have held up well for me and I have never had a problem with them Altogether a rugged well made old time mug at a good price that I highly recommend   
Doesnt keep me warm Its thin Maybe would be good for summer nights 
I use this as my main sleeping bag Being a bigger guy I much perfer a blanket than a traditional sleeping bag This opens up to make a nice blanket and I keep the bottom zipped to anchor it with my feet Very happy 
great for kids first set 
Basic functional mess kit Its design is probably unchanged for the past 60100 years Its small light and functional perfect for hiketo camping 
My friend had an older mess kit from the BSA It was still aluminum but it was much heavier and sturdier than this set After a rough camping trip my mess kit is now dinged up and dirty I wasnt planning on keeping this thing immaculate but it dinged up faster than expected Despite this it should last many more camping trips Its also a little trickier than the BSA version to pack together The peices need to fit a certain way and it isnt as forgiving as the BSA mess kit Otherwise it worked well and Id buy it again if I had to 
Nice bundle its the way to go if you want to be prepared for camping 
have used all before liked them all 
Exactly as described 
This fits a Coleman 2 burner stove perfectly I put it butted up in front of the picnic bench at the campground and stake the two front legs Withstood 20MPH gusts of wind 
This stand should work well with any size camp stove Other reviews say the stand is too big and their stove nearly drops through to the ground But a quick look at the box reminds you that it is adjustable In other words if the fully extended stand is too big from left to right then set it up for the correct size for your stove You still need to use the support bars to set the stove on This means it is always fully extended from front to back but left to right is what you need to adjust to fit your stove Thats what we do and it is perfectly stable and is a great accessory Very light and quick to set up Glad we own one 
Ive had this stand for a couple of years and Im very happy with it It folds up compactly and is quickeasy to set up I recommend staking the legs there are holes in the feet for this I also put a piece of plywood that is slightly larger than my stove on the stand under my stove  this allows some extra room to hold some of the things that you need when cooking 
We carry two of these when car camping A stainless one for cold perishables and this red one for other food Keeps the Corgis and other critters away from the good stuff when camping 
This is a joke There is nothing steel about it All plastics except for the hinges You can get the same quality for 50 less 
I have wanted one of these for YEARS so maybe Im a little biased but I love this thing It has a very classic look to it and it keeps things plenty cold We used it for a road trip and it kept things plenty cold for three days The downsides  The latch is not the strongest thing in the world and would be a dealbreaker for me if I needed something I could rely on to stay closedie tossing it around on a boat or on a hunting or camping trip where large foraging animals might be a real possibility If you overfill the cooler even SLIGHTLY the latch fails instantly and wont even keep the lid closed The handles are metal which I both love and hate It looks awesome but can make it a little uncomfortable to carry over longer distances 
Love it 
20 words for a cup Ok Its pretty blue handle doesnt fall off when its full of coffee and did I mention its pretty blue Good cup 
I use this mug as a shaving bowl and toothbrush cup The handle is wide enough for a two finger grip and the fingers wont touch the side of the cup to prevent burns from a hot cup However I never used it for anything hot so I cant comment regarding hot liquids yet 
The handles get terribly hot if you are drinking coffee or cocoa out of them The liquid also cools really fast too Dont get me wrong though these are wonderfully handy and when we are out camping they are the best to have No worries of broken glass or melted plastic  
I too found this product very unsafe Just the slightest bump or nudge like attaching the propane bottle and the stove was falling through the middle Not the best thing to have happen when youre trying to cook I guess I could glue on some velcro strips like one of the other writers but I shouldnt have to Instead I did convert it into a trash bag holder I got it on a year end close out so the sting of an expensive trash holder isnt too bad 
Very nice stand Once you have it setup it holds lots of weight I installed velcro on both the stand and my stove to hold it tight Very good product 
We own two of these stove stands and we are considering a third as an addition not a replacement We purchased the stands 8 to 10 years ago and have used them several times each year They are none the worse for wear We put our 2burner camp stove on one stand and the ice chest on a second one Based on the design of our current stove we must carefully gauge the proper width of the stand for the stove but once it is set up it is perfect The feet of the stand have holes for staking the stand in conditions where you might feel a need to do so such as when set up on uneven terrain or if you anticipate people or pets might be inclined to bump into it Overall we find the stands to be very stable I like this design over a camp kitchen because it allows me the flexibility of setting up each component individually based on the characteristics of the camp site This stand cannot be beat for portability lightweight and extremely compact when collapsed Sometimes we place a board over the top of the stand to make a portable table for preparation dishwashing or to support a small grill As for price we paid 20 for the original purchase and the current price is not that much more I consider the Coleman High Stand an excellent value 
I think this product is priced too high based on its quality I paid 32 I think its worth about 20 The stand is very shaky and it really needs to be staked down when used Also if you use the stand to place a camp stove on it you need to secure the stove to the stand with velcro straps The good news is that it is very light compact and easy to use The height is just right as well 
This telescopes out and two long hinges flip over and lock in place It weighs next to nothing Its quite useful its no fun to cook on the ground I never had any issue with this stand not supporting my camp stove Theres no way it will collapse Just use common sense and it will do what its designed to do 
junk 
Great product havent used over an open flame yet but seem sturdy 
This is a really neat nested set that will come in handy for camping trips or emergenies I would recommend this item 
You get what you pay for Very small Very light weight I was used to the old mess kit my dad had from Army Surplus This is not nearly that good 
This is a must have for emergencies I remember my Dads combat set we used to play with when I was a kid It was made of stainless steel which I considered However weight adds up in your bug out bag So this lighter weight aluminum will do just fine 
yeah its light weight just be prepared to bend it back into shape a few times The cup is small My soda can alcohol stove fits neatly inside not a good product if you have to cook for more than 1 person Does not cook with even heat but we know that already 
This mess kit is so cheesy if you put a flame to itIt will melt Dont buy this garbage  
To pretty to use I save it to use more like a center piece with ice only Very nice 
Handy for sleep ins and sleep overs 
Does it job 
They are comfortable can be put over any hat and the holes are small enough to keep any of the local gnats out  in addition to larger bugs I would highly recommend and buy again  as we have now purchased 6 or so of them We have no affiliation with the seller or manufacturer and received no discounts 
The bugs are getting in from the buttom since it doesnt cover the shoulders and isnt attached to the neck 
Well have ours in Florida for sure 
I was not going to purchase this until a friend convinced me otherwise It ended up being on of the most important items we carried during our backpacking trip as it was during the heaviest mosquito and biting fly time of year Next time I will carry this and an extra backup just in case Note that this does not hold up well to any kind of heat and is very easy to melt I bent over within about 4 inches of a lighter while starting a stove and it melted a 1x2 hole in the netting was not in any direct contact to the flame never got closer than 4 inches Fortunately I was able to tie it closed with string from a piece of paracord but it was almost disastrous 
does the job is a little thick which makes it hotter and not as much air to pass through Is not as compact or does not fit as snugly as the see to Summit 
After using a synthetic sleeping bag for almost a year I went back to the basics and bought this Coleman Colossal 20 degree sleeping bag and Im very glad I did The synthetic bag never kept me warm enough when the temperatures dipped but with the Coleman I slept comfortably each night Great size cotton cover kept the bag from slipping off the cot a real problem with the synthetic bag the lining is extremely soft and comfortable overall a real winner 
Thank you 
This cooler is great My dad used to have one just like it that lasted for almost 20 years But his didnt have a bottle opener on the side This thing is very solid and well built but not overly heavy It keeps drinks cool and the ice lasts a decent amount of time obviously longer the more you keep the lid closed Also love the latching lid makes it much easier to keep the ice from melting 
I bought one of these cups just so I could see how big it really was There is no way this cup will hold 12 ounces of liquid Maybe it will hold 8 ounces Either way this cup is perfect for what I need and what I was looking for I would recommend this cup and I have recommended it to my family members This cup is built to last and it is the perfect size for some of my back packing adventures There is nothing like a cup of hot joe in the morning and this is the perfect cup to have it in It is easy to clean and light weight I have purchased more already and I still need just a few more 
I love this cup I originally bought it for use as a shaving mug but use it instead for coffee DONT PUT THIS IN MICROWAVE the underlying material is metal but it can be used directly on burner of gas range It will get hot so be careful of hands and lips touching the rim I knew this before hand And no worries about it smashing if dropped and shards of ceramic going into your foot Enamel may chip off if repeated drops but it can take quite a beating its just a nice versatile mug 
Imagine a friend that you can hold in your hand and pour hot coffee into around a camp fire Now imagine you can stuff that friend into a backpack all day and in the evening they are still your friend A lunatics dream Not so with this mug As long as liquids and gravity abounds it will be there for you 
Does what its supposed to do I am supposed to add 14 more words so I am trying Thanks Coleman 
Should be a few inches longer so it can tuck into shirt better 
Works perfectly 
Exactly what I thought it would be I will definitely recommend this to others I have no complaints with the order 
I was shopping around for a mess kit for 4 BOBs I figured Colman big name associated Im my book with quality I was very disappointed with the quality Some of the edges were a bit sharp After doing research on mess kits I learned that its the best idea to purchase aluminum mess kits With the heat from the fire when heating liquid or food in the cup or pan the kit will warp or not be able to handle the big heat of a fire for cooking or warming Id spend the extra maybe 5 or 1000 for good solid stainless steel kits 
The kit is really good looking but I gave it a 4 just because I have a feeling that the aluminum wont resist many trips or everything you try to cook on it Have to try it and get back to you 
This set is super light but is incredibly thin aluminum and would bend easily I would doubt if the handle for the frying pan would hold much weight I would probably go with a set thats heavier and more durable 
This product is great because its cheap This product isnt great because its cheap The price makes it worth it to me however because its so inexpensive the material is cheap and its just all around not high quality Its great for camping because you know if anything happens to it you can just buy a new one at this price point 
Amazing how small this all fits into Good personal use camping set but dont expect miracles It is worth the price but will get banged up fast Still the thing works for its intended use and is dirt cheap Worth the buy in my opinion 
Great for camping or keeping in a bug out bag Lightweight but sturdy I use the 3pc Camping Eating Utensil SetClip TogetherStainless Steel fork knife spoon set with this item 
Bought two of these little kits for our Cub Scout camping trips and they work great Easy to clean and then packs nicely inside itself for use  storage later Great mess kit for camping 
Very warm and relatively lightweight 
Very comfy and warm and portable little blanket bags Could be used in many ways and works great for warm weather camping 
I purchased this as a sleeping bag liner It is very soft washes well has a full 2 way zipper I use it as a spare blanket now 
Nice lightweight sleeping bag Pros Great for layering Held up well and dried quickly on the trail Wide and long enough for an average guy and great for me Cons Comes with Colemans special red zipper that makes it easy to attach it to one of their bags and impossible to zip it together with a different brand annoying but luckily I have another coleman bag Would I purchase again Maybe The red zipper thing irritates the heck out of me because people should be able to purchase the products they want and not have to buy new everything just so things match and work together I recall as a kid being able to zip any two sleeping bags together new and old and its unfortunate that some brands feel the need to prevent that 
I wish picking color was an option but I still have been happy with this I have 3 if them Great as a summer sleeping bag a blanket when unzipped or a sleeping bag liner when it is colder Its best to unroll it and air it out when you first get it Easy to reroll Really good product 
I took this camping in the boundary waters when the forecast showed consistent evening temps in the low to mid 50s but this did not hold up to the 50 degree weather promise I froze pretty good two of the nights and Im a big guy who is normally incredibly warm I think there is still good application for these bags in a true summer camping situation with nights in the 60s or 70s but I wouldnt rely on 50 degree nights unless you are going to really bundle up I will say it does pack incredibly small much smaller than my colder weather bag so that was a plus for trying to pack light 
Not what I expected Cheesy drain Not what the one in the old days were like 
very sturdy 
I found the quality less than expected The frying pan was dented just from closing it as the lid to the kit However if you need something extremely light it will work but it will bend easily I would not recommend it for multiple uses 
Mighty handy Economically priced and ready for use in the great outdoors Light weight and sturdy design makes Coleman the go to camp ware Great for young and old light weight hikers and hunters 
do not like writing these reviews so next time you will get only one star and see how you like that 
Bought 3 of these for me and my 2 sons all of us over 62 Nice and roomy can pull up all the way to my face and even over my face a bit Im 63 Material inside is nice and soft perfect to rub your toes on in the morning as you wake up Zippers work well easy to open the bag a bit in the morning to cool down a bit as the temperature warms up 
I hate it when I read reviews that say I havent used it yet but i havent hate bugs so the ideal would be never to have to and still figure these do the job Packs very compact which is what I wanted and is there whenever the need arises 
does what it should 
You need to wear this with a hat but it works I recommend wearing this with a collared shirt so you can tuck the netting under the collar for the best protection 
Looks great no damage when it arrived early I will give this a try on the next camping trip 
I always keep one of these in the car and one in the house I love that it keeps the gnats and flies away from my face while hiking Provides good visual ability as well 
all good 
When I bought this mug I wanted camping mug is exactly what I needed It could be heated on warmer hot plate camp fire Delevred on time and worthy the price 
Excellent mug so far I heat my lunch in it daily with the Mr Coffee Warmer a datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefMrCoffeeMWBLKMugWarmerdpB000CO89T8refcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTF8Mr Coffee MWBLK Mug Warmera See my review of that item and I eat soups and gruels with it for lunch Dec 14 review This cup heats fast and the handle stays cool to touch for my purposes A winner 
For what you pay and what you get with this cooler it is of EXCELLENT value I did what everyone else probably didlooked at the Yetis and dreamedand drooled Then got a brisk slap across the face from my wife when she thought I might actually pay 600 ON A COOLER Those Yetis may be amazing but those prices are just absurd and cannot be justified by anyone who isnt literally a mountain man or a hunter who needs ice not to freeze for 10 days Most of us normal guys who go weekend camping dont fall into either of those categories and so we turn our Yeti search into a what cooler is also awesome but doesnt cost me my first born child search Ive only ever owned Coleman and Igloo coolers and so that search began with those two When I was underwhelmed with what Igloo had out there I made the switch to Coleman and was immediately impressed by this cooler My search criteria where as follows Metal hinges had an old Igloo with plastic hinges finally blow out on me granted it was a 30yr old cooler so props to Igloo Metal handles Solid handle andor locking mechanism Hard lined and oring sealed The Coleman SteelBelted Cooler fit all of these criteria and was available for the modest price of 80 I deemed the 54 quart to be of substantial size based on the can capacity that is listed in the description I love that Coleman knows their customers and knows we will want to know how many beerI mean soda cans that the cooler can fit Trust me folks Ive beaten this thing up to heck and back on my camp trips and it has performed admirably It can take a hit and keep on going washed of easily with a hose the hard lining wipes out quickly with a paper towel and it kept my ice frozen for 2 days straight Also is a sturdy seat option for when your idiot cousin steals your chair at the campfire 
perfect size for 4 day family camping Sturdy great looking Impressive insulating ability great lookingI wish it had lockshasps to better ward off racoons Reasonable weightsome super coolers that cost 400 are 35 lbs EMPTY 
This RED cooler is awesome Not an oversized but perfect for the beach or poolside The red color made it better than any other cooler that could do the same job Couldnt beat the price 
Bought for my husband to replace our old plastic cooler Havent used it yet but seems to be of very good quality 
Looks awesome locks well holds a lot but doesnt keep ice as long as the cheap plastic coolers Really disappointed 
Greetings AmericaI received this for a Christmas gift  while Ive NOT used it just yet the pics of this online DONT do it justice This cooler is a real beauty You cannot go wrong w a RED cooler especially being a Louisville Cardinals FAN I will update once I use it Until then my FriendsHappy New YearsCHEERS 
cool retro 
I owned one of these mess kits back when I started to go camping and this was the only kit that I can afford It was OK for its purpose but back then I didnt know any better Back then I had the notion that all camping equipments are pretty much the same that it just all depend son how you use and utilize it Now for the life of me I couldnt understand on how I managed to burn frying scrambled eggs which is a NoBrainer for everyone which I cooked on this mess kit Little did I know that the workmanship of this mess kit is sub par at best that its made for beginners and Boys scouts in particular made as their first kit So I just accepted the fact that I can never fry perfectly good eggs with this until i came to a Army Surplus store in Berkeley and found my first REAL Military mess kit which is the German Bundeswehr mess kit It was 995 and I said Why Not I tested that and immediately i found out that having the RIGHT gear really makes all the difference I fried a couple of scrambled and sunny side up eggs on that mess kit that now I know how to fry it right and its perfect every time Right after that I decide to donate this Coleman mess kit to charity and vowed never again to use inferiormade products It was worth a little from when I used it but I wasnt satisfied from the results from it And just like everything else in lifeyou actually get what you pay for Using a Military mess kit against this is like night and day difference My newly acquired German mess kit was clunky quite heavy but robust dependable and made just like a Tiger tank This mess kit was flimsyjust like any other Americanmade car with a ton issues This kit is NOT recommended and you would be advise to look for a better mess kit anywhere else If mess kits is your thing then I would advise to get ANY military made mess kits for theyre not only dependable but also battletested and used in the field There are some mess kits and canteen cups out there that at least 50 years old and it had been in at least 2 wars and its still functioning and usable 
I really like the kit the only reason for not the perfect rating is I believe a little more thickness in the material would be nice even if I had to pay more 
A lot smaller than I expected but ok for one person I should have read more reviews  oh well 
Ok 
i read a lot of reviews rubbishing this very simple cooking kit it is super light and looks a bit flimsy but i can see myself using this for a long long time it is perfect for traveling and for cooking a small meal for two   i had to get this cause my trangia cook set is made for one small 12 year old girl who does not like to eat 
Thanks for having this available my old set I lost some of it and just worn out ill be using this in a couple weeks I hope thanks again for having what I wanted 
Received delivery 21414 75 inch frying pan rim bent 6 inch deep dish plate large dent in bottom of deep dish plateiam keeping this to remind me about this wonderful service I received from  think fast I know this isnt the best mess kit didnt expect for it to come damageno damage to mailing packagecoleman box had two or three tears and half openmaybe this will help think fast do right thinking I hope 
Like that it comes in a bag While it takes some work to get it back in the bag makes it easier to travel Perfect for camping 
Its definitely not as warm as I thought it would be Bought it to go with my 3 season sleeping bag but still wasnt warm enough in autumn temperatures Had to buy a down sleeping bag for those early spring and late fall nights Useful if using just in the summer though or with a hammock 
this is a nice fleece sleeping bag although it doesnt pack down very small and is almost impossible to fit in the stuff sack that it comes with it adds a good amount of warmth to an existing bag 
I like this because it is cheap and compact and not too hot Most sleeping bags are too hot for me This works nicely 
I got it for emergencies and camping Im very satisfied as it appears to have a decent weight and should be quite versatile I was sent the red which is more of a brick color No complaints on this one 
Very handy perfect for a layer or a cover on chilly morning or evening Welcomed addition to camping gear 
it does the work well 
Some Days 
great 
This product was exactly as advertised 
Great for funerals 
Straight forward approach to keeping bugs out of your face For the price its a good deal  Very pocketable Seem to be made well 
Kept the ice frozen for a long time wish it were slightly bigger though especially for the price Probably would have been just as happy with a cheaper one 
This is so cool 
I love this cooler I was looking for something with a kind of retro look and stumbled upon this one The design is simple and sleek and really does do justice to the original style Coleman coolers of yesteryear Ive only used the cooler a handful of times thus far and the ice retentioninsulation properties seem to be pretty good Im not taking this thing on a rafting trip or some sort of expedition so it doesnt have to be bomb proof which a lot of people have complained about Absolutely fine for tailgating and car camping Will keep everything cold for multiple days more so if you pack the cooler properly and arent continually going in and out of it Based on others reviews I will be more careful with the hinges and clasp to ensure that that doesnt break because it sounds as if that is the one downfallweakness of this design I purchased this cooler at halfprice because it was on sale  dont know that I would have paid the sticker price for it but Im completely happy with it as is 
I have had my kit for close to 15 years It has never failed me It gets bumped and dinged and bends right back Packs up small and lite But I know I can alwYs count on it 
IT SERVERS IT PURPOSE LIGHTWEIGHT AND COMPACT BUT CHEAP PRODUCT VERY EASY TO BREAK WILL NOT LAST ENOUGH FOR A SERIOUS CAMPER 
Im on a tight budget and thought whats the worst that could happen these end up being as flimsy as everyone says Surely I can still cook in them no matter how badly constructed they are BZZZZZZZ WRONG I didnt even bother with these I used my friends camping pots to cook stuff They are a JOKE The metal is so thin you could puncture it with a knife I would never dare put these over something hot then grab them later as its guaranteed to burn your fingers They bendscratch like no other and worst part is they awkwardly sit inside of each other and can easily fall out unless you put them in a bag DONT BUY THIS JUNK SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GET SOMETHING BETTER FOR A BIT EXTRA I mean seriously dont even make the mistake of buying these to get buy if youre on a tight budget if youre trying to get by just bring pots from home 
Theyre all aluminum but very tiny If you were a lone survivalist and this was all you had they are great but for a family of 4 not so much 
Nice kit should be easy to clean I doubt Gordon Ramsey wouldnt use it on his shows but it is a basic camp kit I would recommend and its cheap 
Worked out really well for our camping trip Pros Fit well over or under my baseball cap Could still wear sunglasses underneath Kept the bugs off my face and neck Great price 297 Cons No cons for this price 
Works well 
Love it when out working on yard 
I ordered 2 of these for this coming hunting season Trying to keep the mosquitos away Will update after Ive used and let you all know if it did the trick 
I bought it because it had the camo top And it did So it was what I was looking for 
seem good 
When you dont want to tote along your BIG camp stove this thing ROCKS Youll have a hot cup of coffee in no time Its foolproof Its probably bulletproof Simple robust design plenty of heat a stable design  this is an EXCELLENT tool 
I recieved this in good working order and was as advertised I think it would be good for the younger campers scouting age and that general group of out door activities But for those of us older use to normal sized utensils I found both fork and spoon to be a bit small 
I havent use this yet but I actually purchased this for when I camp and need utensils really fast and dont feel like using regular ones I wish the price was lower hint hint to the amazon staff or I would have purchased 2 and keep one in my vehicle 
I bought this to use with addition to my aluminum mess kit made by Coleman It Is very compact and effective at times it can be hard to clean but at home you can just pop it in the dish washer The knife is a little hard to get out but is great to haveI no longer have to use my knife I also think they way that they separate is really nice As a bonus they fit into the mess kits pot that I mentioned above All in all it was a good kit that I will faithfully carry in the woods 
1 open both the fork and spoon 2 put your two hands on either side of the set 3 pop it apart push the fork and spoon towards each other sorta 
Great for extra insulation when camping 
Ordered this for girlfriend Will know more this winter 
Great summer time bag 
My two oldest boys and I used these as warm weather sleeping bags as its hot in GA this time of year They roll up small and dont weigh much so they were perfect to backpack with Quality was good but I felt the size was a bit small for me and Im only 510 Still Im going to take it on the next warmweather backpack trip coming up It kept me warm enough when temps dropped down in the mid60s and I never broke a sweat when it was still really warm out just after the sun went down DSG has something similar for a few bucks less but I dont know if the quality is as good I thought the zipper on these looked like it would last quite a bit longer through heavy use 
While I did not hate the idea of a fleece bad or liner I do not like how these performed They are rated at 50 degrees I used them twice on a week of camping that included several nights of near and below 50 degrees Disappointed When you see you kids curled up trying to keep warm something is wrong We drove home got our other sleeping bags my kids had embark 50 bags my wife had embark 30 modified rectangle bag and I had a 30 degree mummy bag I even tried with fleece pants and top on in 60 degree night The rating is wrong And there is a 2 inch opening at the foot of the bag So maybe this would be good in a warmer night I do not know I grabbed my North Face 30 degree mummy bag and was warm without having to use fleece top or pants I realized after the trip that we needed to return them since all the Coleman fleece bagsliners were do was lying underneath the sleeping bags on top of air mattresses So all four Coleman liners were shipped back to Amazon today Thank you Amazon 
Havent used this product in the field yet but I can tell it will work great Long enough and big enough for my 62 180 lb self Great buy 
Nice cooler but very heavy when loaded Kept ice for 48 hours while on a road trip I wanted a basket for the top and found IKEA has a metal tray that fits perfectly providing a nice area for sandwiches and squishy items 
This was advertised as used acceptable It had one tiny dent in the top and seemed brand new otherwise and was priced less than half of a new one Very happy 
Great Cooler reminds me of a cooler my parents had growing up Very durable and keeps ice all day no problem The latch works great in the back of a rzr trail riding 
I have owned two or three of these cook kits over the last twenty years Never broken one Lost one or two in the choas of moving and storage The one i have currently i have had for at least 5 or 6 years Taken it camping and backpacking innumerable times Yes it will bend Yes you have to be a little careful about how you use these They are for light duty I have used them on the open fire usually raking a few coals out to the side and cooking on them If they bend i have always been able to bend it right back Being made of aluminum they are lightweight The whole thing nests together and then secures closed with the skillet handle and a wing nut I bought mine for around 7 dollars at wal mart and could not reccomend at Amazons price of over 11 at the time of this review In fact for another 3 dollars or so you can get the Stanley Adventure Cook Set for under 15 at wal mart That set is stainless steel and comes with two insulated cups 24 ounce cookpot with vented lid I dont mind my coleman cookset But i love my Stanley cook set Just saying 
I have taken these on a three day backpacking trip cooking all of my meals in these and the only complaint I have is the handle is flimsy on the largest pan When filled with water it is difficult to avoid spilling because of the amount of flex in the handle Other then this one complaint I love the set it is very light weight and contains everything needed to cook in my opinion However if walking for extended periods I would suggest wrapping a small towel around the inner pots to avoid the clanking noise that sometime occurred Pros Lite weight Durable Compact Cons Flimsy handle 
For the price it cant be beat No its not Cuisinart its thin flimsy aluminum But it gets the job done is lightweight and its relatively easy to clean as well There are more durable or more attractive sets out there but theyre all a lot more money I think this is a satisfying choice for the price range Well be using the 2 of these i bought for many scout trips in the future 
Same mess kit made since my childhood I think Not real high class but for camping light they do the job nicely 
It has the look of an alien space craft when its all put together It will be noisy in your pack when youre hiking Its probably not that easy to clean 
This mess kit is better than average It has about everything you would need For some reason when its packed up its a bit noisy and rattles in your backpack Im not crazy about aluminum I dont mind the extra weight of stainless like the USGI kit This one is not as easy to keep clean 
I was the envy of everyone at the campsite 
Does the job Great to sleep with at night when under a tarp rather than a tent I also wear it near swamp areas 
Served its purpose against flies and mosquitoes in Alaska 
great 
amazing product amazing seller very happy 
Awesome sturdy cooler that wont break the bank 
I love this cooler This is my second one The first one got ran over by a truck Long story 
It does the job at a reasonable price 
I finally had to replace my old plastic cooler and this fits the bill for a stronger longlasting product I really like the easyopen and close lock on it and while Im not entirely convinced its worth the price I paid its a very good cooler Amazon had the best price after I looked around 
keeps ice longer than vintage ones 
Easy to carry and very compact put it in my 24 hour gear and it didnt take up too much room 
I got these mostly because of their price compared with other camping cooking sets This might have been my inexperience in cooking in Aluminum pans but I would recommend cooking with alot of buttersprayetc as unlike regular cooking pans they arent at all nonstick But I feel like that is my fault not the pans fault I only gave it 3 stars because after only using the pans for one weekend they already started to deform They still will work for future use but they no longer sit nice and flat Ill keep using them until I no longer can I just dont know how long they will last 
Do not spend money on this item It simply does not put out to the test Not good Invest in higher end products and we get better supplies LouieV 
I should have read the reviews better The cook set does the job It is much better suited for 1 person than a family The pot with the lid would maybe hold a can of soup We still used it along with a bigger pan we brought camping 
I love this liner I traditionally sleep with a heating blanket What traveling I do not take my heating blanket so I tried using this It works great I slept in in for a week straight Cozy soft warm I used it camping with a mummy sleeping bag It was a little awkward in a mummy bag but I still liked having it and it made it possible to sleep without being too cold 
used this to add a bit of warmth to my kids sleeping bag in about 40 degrees and workd like a charm 
I am always cold especially on airplanes so I knew Id need a huge blanket for our overnight intl flight This was perfect kept my feet toasty and cozy and now we can use it for camping backyard movies or a road trip blanket 
I used this product recently with my sleeping bag It feels very thin and I dont believe it gave me much extra warmth at all Im going to just keep this to use when its really warm out if i want covers at all 
This sleeping bag liner is just what I needed It is roomy washes and dries well and isnt rough on my sensitive skin The only thing Id like to see is a placket over the zipper which can be uncomfortable if you roll over on it 
I have seen these locally for about 800 each on sale so I thought 20 for 6 sounded like a good deal The 20 or below is for only ONE bag NOT a good deal at all 
Flimsy Do not expect it to last long 
Had the mfg added 4 of material to the circumference and 8 to the length this would indeed work well over a brimmed hat I have a floppy brimmed boonie type and as light as the mesh is its small diameter deforms the brim inward Due to the too short length a gap exists right at the collar if you are wearing a T shirt or similarly constructed shirt collar Bugs WILL find that gap thats what they do In addition the elastic around the neck area is sewn in place though you could pull it and the mesh thru a cord lock to keep bugs from getting inside if you were wearing a shirt with a sealable collar The mesh will stop mosquitos unless it is up against your skin because the net is too small but seems too coarse to stop no seeums I think it is just fine enough to stop the black flies that are a plague in the Adirondacks but I havent been able to get back there in years so Im no longer sure about that I do know that they would absolutely find their way in around the collar area Some got thru our pants cuffs even though we shock corded them shut Stepping back why are so many of these products too small in this way The extra material cost is negligible and the labor cost difference minuscule if it could be measured at all Get a darned clue people 
Works perfect 
Bought three different mosquito head nets This one like the other twoworked great Plenty of room to wear a hat underneath the net Just remember if the net touches the neckhead areathe bugs can still bite you 
I bought two of these nets for my wife and I to wear green version It fit well over my Tilley T4 and the mesh was long enough with room to spare I dont get the other reviews that indicated this may have been short Dont see how that is possible unless someone had a very long neck AND a super sized wide brim hat that left less slack The close distance between the mesh openings mean fewer insects can get in but also can partly but barely obscure vision 
This cooler is well built and I expect Ill get years of service out of it The only thing I dislike is the latch for the lid It doesnt cam over the same way the old ones did tightening the lid as it locked into place It also doesnt have a bottle opener like the old models but seriously weve all went to twist top bottles and plastic anyway 
When comparing prices with the new super coolers I went with the old standby for 15 the price Glad I did It works good enough and I dont have to lock it in my car for fear of theft The lid doesnt tighten down and there is little adjustment but thats the only downer 
The only thing giving this a four in my review is the latch I gave this as a gift to my parents so Ive been out on excursions and used this cooler with them The latch isnt like the old ones It doesnt cam over in the same manner and doesnt pull the lid down tight It also doesnt have the bottle opener like the old ones but really who uses bottles without twist tops anyways 
awesome 
I have an old boy scout cook kit which is very nice but it is an antique I got this to replace that kit and am not impressed with the quality or thickness of the metal the little pot feels very flimsy and the plastic grip on top is not very strong The plate and frying pan are the same thickness and I would not try and cook anything on it I would avoid this and buy a mess kit of better quality 
Although its comprised of the traditional mess kit design The aluminum is very delicate I can bend any of the pieces with little effort cj 
Nice light set In a pinch it will be serviceable Travels easy saves space and works in bug out bags Fits well in the pound equals pain equation 
Bought this to go with the foldable pocket cooker also available on this website Would also recommend the Bear Grylls fire starter Perfect fit in my emergency survival bag 
I love it for back packing can get a nice meal or a cup of coffee 
Coleman has a reputation for delivering the great out doors and this product does that it allows you to have an oven on your Coleman stove any where you need it it also doubles as a food warmer Face it how many of you can get all the items in a meal cooked to perfection at the same time with only two burners Yes another stove would help but be realistic This product is quick to set up and it cools down very quickly for packout after the meal is done If you want a light weight addition to your galley or chuckwagon this item will do the trick 
Very goodthanks 
Too small Yes its compact but so much so that its not practical to use 
good 
My son likes it Comes apart to wash which is nice 
I buy these to loan or give to guests who travel to north Florida during bug season They will scrunch up into the size of a handkerchief so it will fit in any pocket It is easy to toss over you head when needed If I wear this without a hat and move around like when gardening the top camo part will often slide around and over my face so it needs frequent adjustment But if just hiking it should be fine This is much better suited for going over a small brimmed hat which would keep it in place and away from your face You get what you pay for here  just the basics If you plan to use something like this often I would suggest other options with more space inside a zipper across the neck or even one with a built in hat But this item is a reasonable option for infrequent use 
The only reason for 4 stars is it does not have a carrying sack 
Does the job No mosquitoes in face 
Great for price keeping pests off the face 
okay 
Product is solid No issues 
Exactly what I expected 
I cant believe how fast this thing dries I dropped it in a puddle tied it to my backpack and kept going I had not secured it correctly my failure not the products It was dry by the time I made camp and that was with it balled up and not in direct sunlight On several nights I have had to unzip the bag because its so warm This is my new favorite sleeping bag and yes I know its only supposed to be a liner but it works fine on its own 
I used this as a sleeping bag in a warm environment It kept me very comfortable and after testing inside my sleeping bag looks like it will help a lot on cold camping trips 
Soft  great for around the house Id like to tell you how it is for camping however my son has this in his room and loves it I plan on purchasing a couple more for actual camping 
We use this cooler when we grocery shop to store our meat and cold items until we get home Plenty of room 
Ive used these guys a few times Theyre light and you need to take some special care of the poor babies but they totally help when you forgot to bring a plate with you camping 
Just like I had when I was a Scout just what I needed when I was out in the woods for a week I did use PAM to make sure not to stick and it worked fine just dont get them too hot 
Do not listen to the negative reviewers on this item These pans and pot are great extremely light and packable This is a great buy for any real hikers hunters fishermen or any other type of outdoors person who wants to lighten up there load They are NOT nonstick but if you pack a little square of butter in your food bag you will be just fine Also this set cuts down on your fuel usage the heat transfers thru the pans very quickly due to the fact that the set is aluminium I highly recommend this set 
For me it was too small And no lid for frying pan I guess its good for backpacker but if you do car camping then you may buy something of bigger size 
If this is all you can afford then so be it You can cook with it but its very basic and lightduty If you still want it check at garage sales and dont spend over a buck for the whole kit 
Nice Self contained outdoor cook set Worth the price I would expect them to go up a little in time I dont think anyone can say much bad about this One guy posted that he has had his since he was in boy scouts That says it all Just buy it 
Not used yet I was slightly disappointed with the size felt the description left me thinking it was bigger However I am going to find use for these pans during my next camping trip Really did not utilize it as it was so small Would be great for hiking 
i m a fan of this little set it works well and a HUGE plus is the cup is also aluminum i kept finding ones with plastic i like the fact i can place water and boil it right in the cup for coffee or tea or just heatin up some soup showed this product to a few friends and they now how their own 
Have one of these in each of your emergecy  earthquake kits Keep a complete kit in each car all the time 
I feel I can trust Coleman since its been around since I was well I dont remember HoweverIm tough on stuff After washing the pan handle was benttweekedthe one that holds it all together in a nest Im working on it but jeezIf youre not very gentle go for something sturdier I would bet Coleman makes something betterThis one is kindof fragile 
En realidad todo llego bien y es un muy buen equipo lo recomiendo fue una entrega rpida recomiendo al vendedor 
This gear can get you through the weekend camping trip and maybe thru the next few trips you take For the price you really cant beat it 
This is a low quality aluminum mess kit I give it 3 stars because it does what it says it should Im just a little disappointed in the build quality 
Bought this for campingBOB Arrived in perfect condition I have used it a few times and it seems to be holing up great Would definately recomend this 
This cooler is so fantastic that we bought another one I love the steel on the outside convenient drain plug and matches all your Coleman things It looks retro but has all the modern amenities you could possibly want out of a cooler We had drinks and ice in it used it frequently one night and 4 days later opened it up and there were still a few small pieces of ice 
Works great but is very bulky I do not recommend for backpacking trips 
Good gift for any camper Heats quickly packs down small No complaints 
The thread that connects the burner to the valve cross threaded the first time I put it on Super soft metal poor quality 
This little stove is sturdy and is a nice steel design The top is quite wide and can put just about any size pan upon it Base is plastice but very strong and keeps botttle upright Very pleased 
Mildly satisfied as I have difficulty joining the two halves and they are always falling apart The fork is really small too It gets the job done but not great Id probably try something different if I bought again 
These utensils are so small that they are about the size of those tine souvenir spoons you find at tourist traps Not USEABLE so small it will take you all night to eat your food 
Great to have for all emergencies 
I used this to supplement my normal sleeping bag when camping in northern California It definitely made a difference and I would have frozen without it I would guess that it adds 510 degrees to the rating of your sleeping bag 
I bought these to use with our Coleman sleeping bags They were compatible with our new Coleman sleeping bags as a liner but we used them as a top sheet with our sleeping bags laid out and the zippers were compatible These were better quality than I expected My only complaint is that we could not specify a color and received 2 rust colored bags which would not have been my first choice 
It is very warm and comfortable for a sleeping bag I like the storage bag as well Good for camping 
This is great to take with you if you are planning to crash on someones couch for the night and arent sure what the bedding situation will be  like if the couch is covered in dog hair or not It rolls up to about a quarter the size of a standard sleeping bag so while it isnt huge it isnt tiny either It does provide the amount of warmth you would expect from a fleece blanket so if its going to be cold you will want to plan for a few extra layers but it should be fine for sleeping indoors 
I bought this as a cheap lightweight option to use alone while backpacking or to pair with my other sleeping bag on cold nights It is soft washes well and because it is fleece it doesnt absorb water quickly so its great when its a bit wet outside I love the soft feel of the fleece as opposed to the slick lining of a sleeping bag 
This is definitely a sleeping bag for warm weather I wouldnt want to have to rely on it if the temperature dropped below 60 It is very compact and fits nicely into the stuff sack However it has a horrid chemical smell that a single washing hasnt gotten rid of Maybe from the dye I ended up with a reddishorange bag I wish there was a way to choose the color I want but there isnt I am tempted to sew a sheet into the inside of it as I dont like the way the material clung to my clothes But the price was right You get what you pay for 
A life saver We were at Shark Bay Monkey Mia and all over western Australia and Fiji in this head net My daughter said I dont need one of those but after two minutes at the Stromatolites in Australia she was begging me to get it out of the backpack It wasnt very fashionable but who cares  Had it not been for the protection of the netting I would have eaten at least a hundred bugs and swatted at least 5000 flies off my face for hours upon end and Im not kidding or exaggerating Those bugs were horrible and repellent did not work They could make a beautiful catamaran ride on the crystal clear Shark Bay a torture chamber I heard mosquitoes buzzing all around me at night but they didnt get near my neck or face and who knows what crawled on me in bed but they stayed off my face and thats all I cared about If you are going anywhere buggy take a baseball cap and this net to make your hikes and sleep less noticeably infested HIGHLY recommend 

Dont know yet 
Small but ok 
it works 
Wish it had a drawstring on the neck area bit I believe it gonna work wonders when hunting sitting by trees Come deer season Ill repost how well it keep the buggers away well out of my ears 
Very good product is designed with high warm I recommend it for use in 100 satisfied with the product purchased thanks 
This is a great item either for camping or for your emergency pack I did my research before purchasing this item and it is a great buy 
IT IS LIGHT COMPACT EASY TO USE AND EASILY FITS INTO ANY BACK PACK IT IS LIGHT WEIGHT AND IT SHOWS USE BUT THEY LAST A VERY LONG TIME IT PROBABLY WILL OUTLAST OUR CAMPING DAYS FOR SURE IT IS GREAT FOR SURVIVAL AND FALLOUT CONDITIONS IN THESE TYPE OF HARSH CONDITIONS IT IS SO VALUABLE THAT IT SURPASSES ITS COST BY A VERY LONG SHOT 
I was expecting something a bit more hefty like the Boy Scouts almuinum mess kits they used to make when I was a boy back in the 1960s Not happening these things are flimsy but WILL work for short term use just dont expect them to work like the boy scouts alumium or the armys alumium ones Theyre probably12 pound lighter than the army ones they DO work for the price 
This is a good product for the price but I wouldnt plan on making it for long time use If you camp 1 or 2 times a year or are a backpacker with limited space Id recommend it If you are a serious camper with long term plans your much better off spending approx 4 times as much Id only recommend this for the reasons stated UpDate Went to the Desert Super Bowl Weekend and this Low Cost Mess Kit was worth its weight in gold I usually eat MREs but wanted Chili wHot Dogs for the game I had this in my BugOut bag and enjoyed my Big MealLOL I upgraded this to a 4 Star but would still not recommend this for alot of Camping Hikingetc Thankx Coleman  Amazonthose were the best tasteing Chili Dogs Ive ever had 
I guess if you need to cook 4 different things at the same time this might be worth it But Ill never need that The metal is so thin it practically bends when you touch it now that does mean that its very light so its not all bad It does fold up pretty small too But the cup is about the right size for an espresso So Im not going to use this Im going to get a Stanley Adventure Camp Cook Set instead Its a metal cup with folding handle lid and comes with two plastic cups that fit inside You can also fit a gas canister and stove if you remove one or both of the cups This Coleman set does have a pot with a lid so when I decided to get a cup I searched for a cup with a lid I only found two strangely Most metal cups have no lid which is very inefficient in that it wastes fuel 
Very good product 100 recommended 2 thumbs up 

Good product with fast shipping 
bulky 
Very handy  compact great for camping or powerout situations Gas bottle not included 
I had one of these back in 1965 they hold up for ever this a be the last cooler youll ever buy made very well And very strong 
Not made like the old classic ones Latch is a cheap plastic piece that had already fallen out in to the shipping box Weirdly enough the screws were all stripped too 
Delivered on timelooks great cant wait to put it to usemetal hinges and metal latch 
I love this thing Got my old one taken by TSA so I replaced it I didnt know that it split into two separate utensils until I got this one Very cool and compact 
Replacing this with the exact one I had that I lost last year For the most part no problems with it except sometimes stick food or sauces gets stuck in storage area red  its hard to wipe off while away from a running water 
Absolutely perfect for camping Takes up no space and serves its purpose And with the Coleman brand you cant go wrong The price was right too Would recommend 
worked well in area with bunches of skeeters 
I keep in my hiking bag because sometimes I end up hiking in places and find bugs flying around I HATE BUGS FLYING AROUND MY FACE They make me mad when I hear them buzz in my ear or smack into my face or fly in my mouth when breathing heavily because of strenuous hiking I toss this on over my hat and can enjoy nature without the insects near my face awesome purchase 
Yes you look stupid wearing it but its fun watching the mosquitoes trying to get at your face I do a lot of hiking and I have turned around in the past because the bugs were so aggressive The little buggers would actually fly around my sunglasses and land on my eyeballs They would also bite me so much Id look like I had some virulent plague by the end of the hike Then I bought a bunch of these and all my head problems were solved I do recommend getting a broad brimmed hat preferably one that protects the back of the neck too When you wear this net over the hat it stays away from your face and is no inconvenience at all until you try to drink from your hydration system If it turns out that the bugs are behaving you can fold the net up and put it under the hat Many times Ive had other hikers tell me they wish they had one and ask me where I got mine Theyre so cheap I have several spares in the house that I can lend to cohikers Most of them have bought their own by now though 
Wish I would of bought one many years ago went into the woods in Auguest and skeeters didnt bother my head at all I wore a baseball cap under this I think a boonie cap would be a better choice 
Good size quality seems good as well 
KEEPS MOSQUITOS AND MORE IMPORTANT TICKS OFF YOUR HEAD 
There is an area on top that is open would have liked to have it closed I wore a hat and it worked well 
This is a lifesaver Especially with the diseases that mosquitos are carrying today 
Simple lightweight effective Its nothing fancy but it gets the job done for sure Would buy again especially for the price 
well it is lightweight and easy to use but the aluminum is cheap bends easily takes on soot badly i gues it would be nice for a child but it isnt for serious camping 
i use to use these when id go camping alone as a child i lost them once in the woods while hiking and never bought another set until recently use these with my Coleman while on the road i can pull over and make my own meal at any rest stop and sit to talk with the other truck drivers 
these are ok but are really thin metal so indirect heat is recommended it doses fit well in my bob bag 
I was very impressed with this from the moment I took it out of the packaging First of all VERY fast shipping ordered Friday and received Monday Also very light and pretty compact Overall great kit only reason I gave it 4 instead of a 5 is that the handle is very easy to bend by your own strength Should hold up to a decent amount of weight in the pan though 
I was a boy scout in my young days and had a similar mess kit for camping This one doesnt even come close to the quality of the old stuff Its thin cheap worthless crap and Im being kind in my review of this item The warning label on the box says  Made In China Contains chemicals that may cause birth defects or damage reproductive organs Dont waste your money on this mess kit 
To say it simply the metal is too thin for actual flame use The metal will bend and you will either burn yourself catching it or spill your rations I cannot see any other use for this except as a pet food bowls Do not buy 
We bought this cooler because we loved the memories that it held It really is a good cooler when used in the environment it was designed for Online now to order a second one 
Does the job intended for 
Great head net Fits over hats 
Quite scratchy unpleasant odor and uncomfortable to wear Had to return 
Keeps the knats out of my face while Im sweating in the outhouse 
Knife not razor sharp but plenty good enough to get the job done Perfect for my two little campers I could easily use this as a good campingcooking knife as well when out in the field 
Works well goes to work with me and another in the bug out bag however the utensils could be just a little biggerthe spoon specifically sould be wider and deeper for soup 
cool 
This is the second one I bought I keep one my bag I use daily and keep the other in my bug out bag They work Everything I need in utensils 
Nice telescoping stand Folds down pretty small about the size of an umbrella The legs have angles with holes at the end making it possible to stake this stand down to avoid tipping a lantern great little added security You can adjust the size of the foot print as well if you have smaller places to put this like indoors for the night or near camp or wider if theres a bit of wind and you need more stability 
I use this for the lantern in my camp kitchen or to hang a shower bag when theres no trees It works great very stable 
Well made I bought 2 Very sturdy No complaints Great price 2 for 40 
coleman is always good 
The knob is set on some sort of dial where you have to have it at a minimum gas setting of COlemans choosing as to what levels of propain your going to use I dont like that It seems they want you to go through more gas Ill stick with my generic camp stove 
Great stove for one person cooking Just got back from a 5 day camping trip I used the Coleman bottle top stove the whole time and it worked flawlessly The base allows you to adjust the angle of the burned enough for use on uneven ground Seems pretty efficient to I used it for 3 days several times a day on one 16oz bottle of propane Burner gives a fairly wide flame spread out over the bottom of the pan To bulky for backpacking but great for car camping Very happy with purchase 
Mal producto inutil para cualquier cosa no sirve ni para juguete de ninios no lo devolvi porque no valia la pena es dinero tirado 
Ok for those who want a super durable will last forever mess kit dont bother with this one This is not its purpose Everything is made from aluminum which yes it does flex a bit but it is also very very light If you ever plan on hiking or putting any part of your mess kit on the lower burning parts of a fire this is the one to get This is the only mess kit ive seen on amazon with a metal cup as well as metal everything else The only downside is the flexing With my own finger strength which is about 14 pounds per finger I was able to bend the handle to the frying pan however I wanted Now of course in use this isnt an issue but for those of you who dont want to leave anything to question that might be something to consider In my experience its a great kit Just add a fork spoon and knife set and you are golden Also if you do put this directly in a fire maybe replace the plastic knob on the top just in case Its on a simple philips bolt and nut so its easy to take off and replace with any sort of metal knob you would like The only reason I took off a star is because of the flexing issue 
I just received this yesterday and I was happy at first I opened the box pulled everything out which was lighter and thinner than what I remembered it used to be I saw at the bottom that it had a sticker Made in China Now I dont mind things being made from there That wasnt the issue the issue started when I looked at the box again I just happened to look at the bottom of the box when I saw a warning notice It said that under California law Chemicals used in this product can cause cancer and other reproduction issues Ill edit this when I get back and even post a picture of this but I feel that putting a warning label at the bottom of the box is WRONG I also think its WRONG for Amazon to not post warning information about items on the site Had I had known the warning label I wouldnt have brought this Coleman isnt the company it used to beit seems it buys cheap hazardous products from other countries and sell them elsewhere for a high profit at the risk of our family lives As a scout and a gulfwar vet Id recommend going elsewhere 
I didnt expect the best quality out of this set because its made of aluminum Of course aluminum bends and scratches easily But its very light and cooks food decently Food did stick to it easily but what do you expect its camping gear We just used some sand to scrub it clean 

Best cooler ever 
Very nice cooler Sturdy and good looking Just as described 
Seems to keep the ice from melting pretty well The latch could be a little more heavy duty Took it on a camping trip Under normal use it will get dinged and the dings dont go away 
We took this cooler along for a 25 hour road trip to Montana The cooler is sleek a little heavy but kept ice for several days and then icy burn your hand cold water for a few more Very happy 
I loved this liner You can use it alone or within a sleeping bag I recently went on a 2 week camping and hiking trip and used to both ways I had no problems The material is soft There were no smells It rolled up easily It gets leaf debris stuck to it easily Other than that I dont have anything negative to say 
A comfortable lightweight product This liner can be used without a sleeping bag and youll find yourself nice and cozy  
I bought two of these back in Feb to use on a winter camping trip with my sons Boy Scout troop I just ordered 3 more so everyone in the family now has one In the winter they worked great as sleeping bag liner and kept us warm when the temps got down to the 20s at night sleeping bags are rated to 30 degrees In May I took these on a camping trip with one of my daughters Girl Scout troop We used only these at night no sleeping bags and were comfy with the temps in the midtohigh50s at night No more bringing sleeping bags for family camping trips in the springsummerfall These are smaller and take up way less space in the car than 5 sleeping bags even though they compress well and are backpacking sleeping bags  which is nice They are good quality You can unzip them completely so they lay flat to use as a blanket too 
Does the job at night 
Forget about the mosquitoes 
Very fragile and my wife had to sew It Spend a couple bucks more and order something better 
Thanks 

Fit for purpose Arrived on time and fit for purpose 
I thought these were the ones I have had for years I bought more for my kids These are much smaller than my older ones It worked out ok for me because they were for the kids anyways There is nothing wrong with them they work as described and seem to be of good quality I guess the smaller size is good for camping since you have to pack everything These will work fine for adults I just happen to have bigger ones and like those 
perfect tool for the camper there is also a knife in the set which is nice id definitely recommend it for someone 
Nice quality Easy to use Look like theyll be easy to clean These are for my emergency Go Bag I will be able to eat using nice sturdy cutlery and save the plastic stuff they hand out at the shelter to play Pick Up Sticks with 
What can I sayit looked better in the pic The spoon and fork are small and the fork easily bent For an emergency kit it might have a place but if you are a regular outdoors camper typeId pass 
bought almost 1yr the backbone on the fork side just broke after a couple of times light use by my 4yr old kid never had any abuse whole set looks like new except that broken backbone now fork and bottle opner can swing almost 360degree contacted manufactory watting for response i will update later Update contact manufactory all through emails was told only have 90days warranty but they still send me a new one with no charge makes me like this little camper utensil again this brand worth the trust 
Coleman is a name you can trust for camping equipment and you can trust the mess kit that they make to work like it is suppose to light and compact and easy to clean Just what you need if youre backpacking and dont want extra weight 
I dont know how these people leaving 1 or 2 stars are gonna sit back and leave negative feedback on a set of items that costs 9 total what do you expect  works great if youre using it to the proper application also folds in on itself for easy storage  really small  i just keep it in my trunk along with a few other camping things  every once in a while ill find myself down by the river after dark wantin to heat some water up for a dehydrated snack great thanks also it just blows my mind how brainless some people appear to be  expecting a set that averages out to a dollar fifty or somthing a piece to be cast iron grade 
My local WalMart sells these for 9  about the same as Amazon  and I own three of them After using the militaryissue mess kits I wanted some more for camping This is what I ended up getting Im disappointed Ill talk about this kit piecebypiece In general the aluminum is pretty thin for a mess kit Even when being very careful I can only get five or six uses out of a piece before it gets too weak to be useful The metal bends melts and gets holes in it with normal use Its just not made to withstand heat Yes it all nests together provided you put it back together the same way it came out of the box Ive found that I have to bend the plate which is more like a bowl somewhat to get it all back together Unacceptable Eightounce cup Yeah its an aluminum cup with a handle It holds eight ounces The handle comes off without much use which of course its not supposed to If youre thinking about boiling water in this dont This will work fine as a cup for cooled liquids Sixinch deep dish plate Its not six inches deep Its 6 inches in diameter and about 112 deep Its more like a shallow bowl Good for using as a plate or shallow bowl The corners seem to be weak in mine but the bottom always burns through first Its better than using a sheet of aluminum foil but not by much 75 inch frying pan This is the same as the plate just a tiny bit larger but with a handle secured to it with a wingnut Tighten the wingnut to lock the handle into place either open for frying pan use or closed to keep the kit together The handle is very weak and can barely support the weight of the pan with food in it Again it falls apart with normal use 16ounce pot with lid The pot and lid count as two pieces in this fivepiece set Its a weak pot with a weak hanging wire You can boil some water in it sure but its not wellsuited for cooking food The lid is crappy and thin and the small nub on the top its supposed to be a knob is just a piece of plastic thats lazily screwed into the lid Between the screw and the underside of the lid is well glue Something to drip into your boiling water when it heats up Overall this is a very cheap set Not inexpensive at nine dollars but cheap Its flimsy and at times dangerous Theres no way youre going to make a meal even for one person with this thing without spilling stuff Better than aluminum foil sure but not by much Also make sure you stick some plastic silverware in this Youll have to snap off the butt end of everything so it fits but youll have it 
This mess kit is truly the basic kit It includes the cup a tiny pot with antitip tabs the fry pan  cover  dish Light weight compact I like the way it fits together and latches securely The ony delta is that it is made of very light grade aluminum The pan handle is very soft and bends easily My son uses this kit for scouting 
worked great no bites 
Very useful Took on camping trip and they came in very handy Good value 
thx 
Replacing our 30 year old Coleman metal cooler Did not think that our old faithful cooler could be replaced by something comparable but I was mistaken This is a wellmade beauty of a cooler that is worth each and every dollar 
For years we went cheap thought the coolers we bought werent really that much cheaper But we finally got what weve wanted all along and are so lad we did Well built hold ice longer than any other cooler were owned and holds a lot even though it looks smaller than our others We recently had a party and we used this along with 2 other coolers Ice lasted much longer in this than the other 2 So glad we finally got a Coleman 
Purchased as a gift 
I really love using this propane cooker I take it on all our camping trips and find it to more practical than big two burner propane stove and even better than our new butane stove which seemed to eat through butane much faster than this goes through propane The only disadvantage as with all outdoor cooking is the wind AND many cheap pots slide off the burner Using more expensive pots solved that problem Another camper showed me to put it on the ground between totesnot too close to prevent a meltdownbut enough to block the wind 
Excellent product 
I have tried many diffrent tools while camping and this product is just ok My prefered tool is the recently purchased Columbia utensile set but that looks to be a limited production run for the holidays and lacks a can opener I actually own two of these Coleman Untensils and have used them on several trips The knife and spoon are functional The fork is too narrow and frustrating to use The bottle opener and can opener are functional also Knife and can opener needed some sharpening Most of the time I use my Leatherman Super Tool to open bottles and cans simply because the product is far superior for accomplishing those tasks If they widened the fork it would get an extra star Like another reviewer also stated I would NOT put this in a dishwasher Just hand clean it It will last a lot longer 
I use it on my work Spoon and knife are ok but the fork is too small Is a good quality item dont rust like the SE that I Purchase with it The SE 5 on 1 chow set is bigger but is junk Get the Coleman if your are ok with the size Update  April 2 2018 Im using it right now after keeping it on my lucha box for years no rust great quality The fork size is the only thing wrong 
Its small and lightweight I use it at work every day Its been good except for the fact a handle scale broke off after only a couple light uses Ill probably take the other handle scale off so it can match and also because it makes it a bit slimmer 
Bought this to throw in my lunchbox so I didnt have to worry about using plasticware at work or cleaning the silverware they have available I havent used the can opener but everything else is on par with what i expected 
nice handy 
As an avid knife collector who likes to collect hobos and camp knives it seemed I should have one made by Coleman I hesitated buying this knife for several years because I wasnt crazy about its place of manufacture While I buy plenty of knives made in China and have found many of them quite good even excellent I was upset that the Coleman knife was made there As I found myself away from home on a trip and without a knife but needing one I ran to the local big box store to grab a knife My choices were paying 25 for a Swiss Army knife or 10 for the Coleman As I wasnt sure how I was going to get the knife back home on the airplane I settled on the Coleman knife Im glad I did The spoon and fork both came in handy during the weekend trip as did the knife which was sharp enough right out of the package to get the job done The fact that the knife comes apart was really a bonus especially at this price For the price it is hard to beat this little hobo It is solidly built and lives up to Colemans reputation of fine camping gear I was able to clean it with running hot water Id advise leaving it disassembled with the all utensils in the open position while drying The fork is small but you can poke chunks of meat with it and the tines will hold The caplifter worked quite well Admittedly I did not use the can opener as I had a P38 with me My only real complaint it the key ring is a tad small which makes attaching a lanyard a bit difficult In all I found the knife very useful and was happy that I found a post office so I could mail it back home on the last day of my trip At 10 the Coleman Campers Utensil Set makes a nice addition to my collection of hobo knives and came through with flying colors when it had to Im glad I bought it 
I purchased this tent for a weeklong camping trip to the Rockies with my son last summer During the week it rained several times at night and the tent never leaked It also withstood wind in the night which made me wonder if the poles would break and although the tent buckled in several times it snapped right back and nothing broke I did have the fly staked down well due to the wind The stakes provided are probably not good enough in high wind  I recommend getting better stakes for the four corners and the fly The walls slope up at an angle such that when unzipping the door it tends to flop into the tent and if its wet it drips into the tent Its quick and easy to set up two people are pretty necessary to do it though Realize that when buying a tent and it says a six person tent it means six people who are very comfortable with being very close to each other Its really more suited for four people if you plan to have anything besides people inside the tent like your gear With only two of us we had all sorts of room I find the little CoolAir port to be a bit strange its like a little doggie door But it allows you to peek out while lying down This is a great tent for the price 

Received the tent in about a week Tent is easy to set up We put a queen airbed and had enough room to walk around the sides of tent and room for our stuff Probably good for four people comfortably Center height was ample but the sides of the tent were at an angle person walking near the sides had to hunch to walk around the sides of the tentim only 5 10 Cold at night due to the big vents more of a summer tent Overall good tent 
loved baking while camping 
Ive had one of these for years One thing I didnt consider when I got it and I now know DO NOT USE this to heat up so called oven safe plastics like freezer meals ship with First time I used mine I tried baking cookies that came on one of those sheets and it took me forever to get it off of there One tip I have an 8x8 baking stone that was a thrift store find that I use in the bottom It helps dissipate heat more evenly through the oven Do remember that your stove is the heat source so if you have low BTU output burners your oven wont get very hot I have a Coleman stove with 10K BTU burners and the oven does 400 deg F no problem Bakeware that actually works in an oven this small can be a challenge to find be on the lookout for toaster oven size bakeware A second rack would be a nice addition I am considering adding one soon That way I can do a dozen cookies in one shot instead of doing 2 different batches Its been a great addition for those times we want to bake up some fresh cinnamon rolls or do biscuits and gravy for breakfast RV owners that have rigs with no oven this will do the trick for you 
This will add a layer a warmth if weight and compactness are not your priority It works great and is warm enough as a summer bag and warm cloths at night I do wish the zipper could be locked in place and I think Ill use a safety pin so it doesnt unzip when I sleep in it If you had the time Id say go to Joanne Fabrics and buy 3 yards of fleece or microfleece and make your own Otherwise this is worth the time for the price 
I used the fleece sleeping bag liner for a 2 week trek in the Himalayas and loved it for its warmth and comfort Easy to roll up and fit in the bag wide enough to allow movement inside Would highly recommend it My daughter also used the liner as a sleeping bag during her school camp and said it kept her nice and toasty 
Light didnt rip or break in any way keeps the bugs out easy enough to see out of 
A OK  
Great product great service Exactly as advertised 
This is a nice product 
Works great and quick delivery 
A must have 
Great product Keeps ice for days Love it Bought for my husband got our tenth anniversary tin gift 
Well built and insulated but does not include the classic and essential dry food storage trays 
On a typical camping trip in the summer it will keep 2 bags of ice about 36 hours It is well made and performs about like we thought it would Its not over rated like a YETI I talked to a fellow camper just last week The days were in the upper 90s and the nights in the mid 70s he claimed he got about 2 full days before buying more ice Even after about 48 hours the Coleman still was very cold inside although for all practical purposes the ice was done 
We live in Florida and stuffy or leaky tents are an issue This tent was built in a fashion that neither of these issues were a problem The plastic bottom extends up the sides about six inches making a great lower water barrier The top half of both sides of the tent are netting The rain cover extends out over the front and back doors and about six inches from the netting on the sides This allows for ventilation but also assures privacy as no one can see in through the netting unless they actually bother to come and stick their head in between it and the cover The rain cover extending over the doorways also helps to keep out rain if you are slipping in and out of the tent during a shower The last weekend that we used it we had a twelve hour Florida rain All of our belongings stayed nice and dry It was about 50F out but with the doors totally zipped it didnt get too cool either It comes with a couple of neat features There are pockets sewn into the inside to help you keep track of your pocket items glasses and other little things There is a door on both sides and plastic welcome mats the stake down outside which helps keep the sand out beach campers here There is a small zipper in the back to allow electrical access without opening up your entire tent There is also a small approx 12 access door down low to the side It has both netting and a full cloth door It says that it is so you can access your cooler or place a fan We were thinking it would be perfect if you have a small dog that needs to go out at 3 am Put it on a leash unzip the small door and not have to get out of your sleeping bag just be sure to pick up anything he may have left behind come morning I like that in addition to hooks the rain cover also has Velcro straps that wrap around the tent poles It was pretty windy during parts of the last storm but it stayed firmly in place Due to the large amount of netting used in this tent I am not sure how well it would do in very low temperatures but for Florida it is a great product As long as you are camping in mildly cool to warmer weather I can recommend this tent to you Just a quick update We went beach camping with this tent A heavy storm came up The winds were sustained at 35 mph and it was holding up fine We started getting gusts of 57 mph and the poles on the side taking the brunt of it snapped I think that is a fair expectation for this style of tent in a storm of that strength We drove into town the next morning and went to WalMart They had replacement Coleman pole kits but the sizes were off a bit and we had to use a pocketknife to shave some off to make them fit into the joints of the other sections Lesson learnedbuy a replacement pole kit for your specific model ahead of time It will make life a little easier if you have an incident 
I bought these because I needed some cheap aluminum cookingware I thought Coleman made pretty good stuff but this stuff is a joke The aluminum handle on the frying pan is held with a single wing nut If you do not tighten it enough the pan will turn and spill The rivets that hold the pan on are way too weak I feel the whole handle assembly sag with no weight on it The rest of the kit is just as poorly made I would not trust it backpacking or even on a camping trip I couldnt recommend this in either of those situations 
This is an ultra lightweight individual field mess kit for backpackers and similar The design been around for decades have used a few over several of those decades popular because it offers more than the traditional Army individual mess kit Despite its apparent thin  flimsy construction it will last for years with only moderate care and maintenance Dents small scratches and scorch marks can be tapped or buffed out Bent handles can simply be forced back into place notice none here have said the handles fall or break off In the end this kit supposed to be basic  functional not comprehensive  pretty Cooking in the field requires experience and skill Its not the same as cooking on the stove at home Temperatures should be lower coals not flames With this kit each camper cooks their own meals with their own kit with individual portions instead of group portions Heavy foods should be cooked with spits or skewers not these lightweight containers The pots  pans should be supported on something when force is applied Most just eat directly from the pots  pans after cooking Tote an aluminum coffee pot if that cocoa or hot tea is desired Millions over the years including me have done all this and it works 
This mess kit arrived on time as always with Amazon thats always good news I found the product to be very lightweight which is ok as that is what I expected Its very compact and takes little space which is what I wanted I will do business again and I highly recommend this seller Thank you 
I use this to keep bees off my head when Im working on my hivesit does the job 
Inexpensive but good quality and work great 
A must have Folds up tightly and doesnt take up much real estate in my pack Keeps those pesky bugs out of my eyes I use this on every hunting trip A hat can be worn on top of the netting or place the netting over the hat 
Too smallWorks for small head and a small hat only 
As described 
The netting is of the fine quality youd expect from Coleman But it will not stop noseeems Few things do So beware and take care I recommend this netting plus DEET for venturing into troublesome areas 
Thank you 
it helps for that extra lining for your sleeping bag and helps to keep you from messing up the inside of your bag so it increases the life of the sleeping bag also use it as a picnic blanket or what ever 
We took these traveling around Dominican Republicgets cold there at night in March This worked great Nice and warm Wont keep you warm enough in winter weather but it is really more of a liner We used it without a sleeping bag on its own 
I was pretty impressed with this sleeping bag Im a big guy and I find it comfortable and while a bit snug around the chest and arms very adequate It has a 2 sided zipper which is convenient and I like the fact you can unzip it fully to become a blanket or zip to together to be a large 2person sleeping bag This is now part of my ultralight kit for camping and hiking I didnt give it 5 stars because it is really not collapsable what you see is what you get I can get my arctic wiggis bag to compress to nearly the same size but this bag tho this bag is much lighter in weight All in all a good buy for anyone who want a little more protection from the cold a nice soft layer a good ultralight 23 season sleeping bag or doesnt want to have to wash their arctic sleeping bag as often I recommend this product 
Does what it should do Kept me warmer in my 30 degree sleeping bag Im 57 and it worked fine for me 
This has been a great camping accessory for lanterns and a bug zapper I like that it can stake down and used that feature in a serious wind storm Its also taller than I expected which was nice 
Super flexiblenot what you would want in a lantern stand It would be great for LED lanterns but not any lantern that uses liquid fuel My stand had a broken top hanging clip 
Great item Was a gift for my dad and he loved it 
Well built good looking updated classic cooler 
Is well made and a great ice chest 
This was my first backpacking  camping cook set It was light weight and cheap Over the last 5 or 6 years I have gotten dozens and dozens of uses out of it I used this on everything from a 4 week long cross country road trip my wife and I camped and cooked every night to a 10 night backpacking trip on the AT Over the years I have invested in fairly expensive GSI Cook sets from REI Although they did exactly what they were suppose to do I found them to be bulky and to heavy for my backpacking kit This little kit has never let me down There are some cons but for 7 I wont mark it down As a few others have pointed out the frying pan handle can get very hot over an open flame If you put to much weight in it the aluminum frying pan handle will bend but can be easily bent back You cant really boil large amounts of water at once but the little pot is PERFECT for making soup of pasta for one person on the trail Mine is pretty gross looking after years of use over an open fire and with backpacking stoves I have read that their are ways to prevent this but I doesnt bother me The GSI Cookset never got gross but its 6xs the price and less convenient to carry Dont expect a Rachael Ray cookware set This is small cheap lightweight and can take a beating on the trails 
I love this mess kit Provides all you need to cook a meal All the pieces nest together making it compact It is made of thin gauge aluminum consequently it is very lightweight More importantly the thin gauge aluminum transfers heat very efficiently to contents that will heat up quickly Very important when you have a limited heat source Saves fuel be it butane propane wood whatever One big improvementaddition I suggest to this mess kit is a pot gripper handle The included pot handlemess kit stay only fits one pan and is somewhat flimsy REI sells a universal pot gripper that will work with all the containers in this mess kit and only costs 4 Well worth it Mark 
This is a very light minimalist mess kit You can prepare drinking water and cook food with this If you have a controlled heat source like coals from a camp fire or a SMALL camp stove It is ideal to use in combination with an Esbit stove If you have a long hike the light weight of this kit is a blessing I wouldnt use this to prepare food for a big group of people but it is perfect for one or two people It is perfect for boiling water The little pot and frying pan are shallow and it makes boiling cups of water faster Everything you need to heat water for MREs Ramen Oatmeal Rice and canned goods You can also fry bacon eggs fish squirrels bunnies and birds I have a couple of magnets not included but I thought upthat i use on the aluminum plate that I stick together through the plate that I make a lid for the frying pan It helps heat up what I am cooking faster and I just remove the magnets to use it as a plate again I use the little covered pot as a container to keep my side dishes warm after I have cooked it in the frying pan The little cup is good for drinks and sharing a little brandy 
works fine 
To small for me so I gave it away but still a good product 
its a little small for a big head  hat 
Havent used it yet but it looks like a great product 
Def going to serve its purpose 
Worked well I did try on a non Coleman brand csmpstove first and could not get the tempature high enough so had to bake a little longer I then tried on a Coleman stove and was able to get the tempature higher I think the thermometer may be off because I actually baked the cake less time in the Coleman But overall I liked it We also used it to warm up fried chicken we premade from home and it worked well I saw other reviews about using some kind of stone on the bottom to help with better heat distribution Next time I think I will get one and try to see if any difference 

After looking at this thing for years I finally bought one and was glad I did We took it on a week long camping trip to Acadia National Park and used it several times We picked fresh blueberries on the side of Cadillac Mountain and my wife made amazing blueberry muffins the next morning Also we have a child with Celiac disease and we often just get pizza on the night we arrive while setting up the campsite This year we were able to make him a couple of little gluten free pizzas for that night instead of finding him something different to eat Thermometer isnt accurate but once you know how much its off you can compensate Holds heat well and its easy to settle in to a consistent temp 
Best thing I ever added to my camp kitchen Reheats bakes stores flatcant imagine going without one now 
Just what I wanted for my Coleman 2 burner camp stove 
This thing is great A little flimsy but that makes it light to carry so Im cool with it It needs to be centered with the burner if its off centered certain parts will get red hot and if you leave it on like that too long it could melt I noticed it before that happened its off colored now in that area but still works fine Heats up fast works great if you use it correctly 
It cooks stuff Amazing 
It is designed in US made in China The metal top is solid and screws on tightly Unfortunately the black onoff knob is wobbly and doesnt allow you to put it on lower settings it just turns off So add an extra propane tank to your supply as u will likely go thru it faster than expected The base is fine and it supports both Coleman and Ace Hardware propane tanks maybe any 16 oz tank Would very much suggest trying this item out before you go camping or put aside for emergencies make sure the knob is functional 
Does what its supposed to do without any problems Probably doesnt have as much fine variability between high and low flame and even the lowest flame I sometimes feel is too much Also keep in mind you will need a match or lighter to start this stove Otherwise solid product for keeping at a campsite not for backpacking 
Looks great and very functional I love it Worth the price 
I originally gave this a decent rating but Ive changed my mind this thing is so cheap and crappy I wouldnt recommend it unless youre only going for one day camping and thats it It was cool that it all folded into one nice that you get a cup and a pot with a lid but this thing is so flimsy it eventually wouldnt hold itself together If this thing were made of better quality I would buy it in a heart beat But this thing is so cheap you get what you paid for 
I suppose it will work for backpacking trips for one maybe two if they are light eaters it is compact and ultralight which was why I originally purchased it Coffee cup is a joke maybe if u only want a sip it will suffice Id honestly pay a little more to get a more suitable set This one is a skip search elsewhere as I am goingg to do 
I purchased this set at Walmart for about five dollars Since that first purchase I have brought four more This is not for the hardcore camperhiker It is perfect for the average SHTF prepper Its light weight does what it is suspose to do cook food Its perfect for an alchol stove or a wood gas stove I have used on an open jet stove no pot stand and cook a package of raman noodles Like I said before perfect for SHTF scenarios 
Some people may be put off by the cheap construction for the price this is a very very light mess kit and in that respect it is perfect Just handle it with care and you should get years of use out of it 
on the low quality side of the fence but u do get what u pay for on another review i read someone said it was like aluminum foil i think and thats pretty much right but this mess kit is usable u can pretty much only cook small quantities and the handle of the pan seems really weak if ur looking for a mess kit to last then ur better off paying the extra money cuz this mess kit aint the one i dont think id recomend this to anyone except if it was for a child or mayBe a Boyscout if ur not careful this messkit will Break or Bend or proBly get a hole in it in a hurry 
This is huge and warm I didnt not purchase it for a sleeping bag just as a blanket that keeps feet warm This blanket when unzipped is huge So soft and warm I purchased the green color 
I woke up sweating on a cold night and had to take the liner out of my sleeping bag so I could get back to sleep Extra insurance against the cold in a small size that is easy to pack and not expensive to purchase there is no reason not to pick this up to help you stay safe and comfortable 
I bought this to use as a liner because I was borrowing my friends sleeping bag for a fall camping trip I found it adequate and as expected Its fairly compact and comes in a cheap quality stuff sack The fleece is soft and the zipper worked fine It does say to wash in a commercial washer as I read in a comment but its small enough to fit in my regular sized one I believe thats probably something that is standard on sleeping bag tags All in all Id buy it again 
I love these stands I cant say enough about them I say buy these if you want your lanterns off the ground and their so easy to use BUY THEM 
Have not used it yet bit looks like it will work well 
I like it so far 
Your wife will laugh at you buying these but her and the kid come running for them when all the biting buts come out seriously saved my trip to craterlake oh we will go for a nice walk around crater lake and take shots of the sunset then the mosquitos attacked us like crazy if I wasnt that silly husband who buys these head nets we would have never enjoyed our time there Now I just keep 4 in the rv couples were literally running back to their cars as we layered up with rain coats and insect head nets strolling along like theres no bugs DO NOT DRIVE ACROSS AMERICA in the summer WITHOUT THEM 
Bugs in the south are a constant problem to those of us who have retired down here and arent accustomed to them I find this netting placed over my hat does the job of keeping them from my face 
Light enough that a supporting hat is not necessary 
Its VERY small 
works great keeping noseeum Nats out of my mouth on my rides 
stupid bugs 

Had this at a rock festival and on day 2 when everyone was waking up hungover we had the neighbors saying they thought they smelled biscuits and gravy Sure enough we brought extra and invited them over This thing collapses to nothing and heat control is impressive with a small flame Weve done biscuits and gravy apple  peach cobbler muffins cornbread and pizza bread so far We have dutch ovens but for places you cant have a fire or times when you dont want the cleanup this is a GREAT alternative A bonus is that small trays cost nothing for this and can be had at walmart or dollar tree for a buck 
Its a Coleman after all 
I bought this product a local gunoutdoor store It was only 4 and I thought it would be decent to cook a few meals They are cheaply made and benddent easy Once you burn something the thing is trash I suppose you can use it for an emergency in your car 
I have had no problem at all with mine Any of the problems Ive read about this have been human errors I have used these just the same as pot and pans in home ive cooked fresh rice and simmered in the cover pot as you would in a home fried cooked grilled and boiled with the frying pan The plate is the perfect size needed The only thing wrong with these are the people using them If you are paying attention to what and how your cooking they wont melt or turn redhot you dont put this sitting directly on a burning log This set is extremely light weight easy to clean and compacts to be very small everything you want in a mess kit 
if you need something cheap and servicable thes work but I encouarge you to save up for higher quality things to cook your food in they do take a lot fo abuse and keep on working and everything nests together well The whole package is fairly light for what you get 
This stove is worth the extra weight it cooks evenly and stands very sturdywhich is important when surrounded by craggy terrain and ish like that Good and solid product 
this may be a little bit bigger than other portable ultra light camping stoves but now that i have used it i wouldnt want anything else the one thing i read about the ultra lights is that the overall area to place a potpan on is small and can be flimsy so i purchased this guy it held all of my camping potspans perfectly and since you slide the bottle of gas into the round base you can adjust it if you are on a little bit of a slope loved this and will be a staple for future camping trips 
The lowest setting is way too big You cant slowly heat things The platform size is quite large though which is good for a good sized cast iron skillet 
This is a really great and very well made item It is also very convenient and easty to use You just screw the top on and plump the cylinder into the base It uses the short fat cylindersnot the longer kind you usually see plumbers using with torches I had one of these things but I cannot locate the thing anywhere so when Hurricane Irma headed towards Florida I hurried and ordered another one Thankfully the hurricane did not hit the part of Florida I live in the panhandle My old stove got me and my late father through the hell that was Hurrican Ivan which did hit here in September of 2004 We did not have power or drinking water for the better part of the week and half the trees were knocked down Our roof lost every other row of shingles the storm windows blew out with loud bangs and the siding of our house which my neighbor John returned to me as a joke blew three blocks down the street Dad and I did have hot coffee and hot meals though and we did have plenty of water since I am a home winemaker and had filled my six six gallong fermenter spigot buckets up to the brim I also have a two burner Coleman propane stove around someplace but I cannot find that either I used this stove once or twice before deciding the single burner was more than sufficient for coffee tea or dinner We ate chilit mostly Hormel with no beans with two cans of Bushs chili beans thrown in With this stove you do not have to go through the routine of putting soapy water on the joints to check for gas leaks There is only one connection If it does hiss when you screw it on it means the valve is open so you just rotate it To light it just open the valve a bit until it hisses and light it with a match or butane lighter You turn it down or up or off with the valve In case you are not familiar with propane torches the gas coming out makes the connection near the tank icy cold to the point that frost starts to form No kidding Frost will form because it is the same principle that makes your refrigerator work I said torch mind you I did not let the burner run full blast The flame might eventually hurt the cooking grid part though it seems very sturdy I think they have improved this burner a bit since my old one and if I ever find the old one I will compare the two A word about liquid fuel stoves A Wal Mart add for a dual fuel stove said the Coleman dual fuel will burn over four times whats in a cylinder per gallon This is a no brainer though since the cylinders only contain a bit over sixteen ounces of liquid and the gallon has 128 ounces The also used to make endless jokes about liquid fuel gasoline stoves blowing up and sending people to heaven when I was little  The straight line gases in order from lighest to heaviest are methane ethane propane and butane After this you get gasolines followed by mineral spirits kerosenes fuel oils and paraffins like Vaseline and tars Methane and ethane often called natural gas are not liquids at safe pressure Propane is a liquid at about 15 atmospheres of pressure The stuff in your little bottles is a liquid and not a gas Butane is liquid at about the pressures you find in soda or beer bottles This makes butane ideal for plastic lighters though it is more expensive normally than propane per ounce Natural gass of course is cheap but an actually cylinder of gas as opposed to liquid would give you very little cooking time They do use gas gas in city vehicles but the things do not have a great range per charge So if you live in hurricane country or like to camp this and other Coleman products are very nice I do give it five stars 
I bought this to use with the standard Army issue sleeping bag The standard bag is warm but the material itself feels cool to the touch Good in the summer but not so nice when the winter sets in If only it was fleece lined on the inside Using this fleece bag inside the thicker outer bag is heaven on a cold night The fleece is pretty thin so it doesnt really add too much temperature wise but the feel of fleece against the skin is miles apart from whatever crap they build those other bags from By itself its really not too warm even on a mildly cool night But its great to curl up in under another blanket Oh and it unzips fully into a fleece blanket Being squared off not like a mummy bag means you actually get a useful blanketshaped blanket out of it too 
My main con is that it really stinks even wasching it in a bathtube over night I dont have a frontloader which is for most sleeping bags even this one recommended with sport wasching detergent didnt remove the smell completely It has a sqare shape from top to bottom without an additional head section like in a regular sleeping bag So if you open it it is like a regulare thin fleece blanket with a bold zipper on it Overall it will do better than just a blanket in my sleeping bag because it is nearly closed on all sides there is a not closed area at the bottom from about 2 inches before the zipper starts 
It is exactly what you would want out of standard sized fleece sleeping bag It also unzipped all the way to make decent sized blanket It keeps you warm in an air conditioned hotel room so I figure it will be just fine for mid 60 degrees and up Packs up pretty small too 
If you are going to be taking your family camping this is an essential item The classic green Coleman cooler 
works well Keeps the bugs out Best if worn with hat 
Good to have on hand if you are headed into an area with heavy mosquitos can keep in pocket or pack until needed 
good quality net 
high quality sure to keep the bugs out of our faces 
very nice 
Looks good Seems to be well constructed Its winter still so I dont know how I will like it during mosquito season but it should be fine Its lightweight and small so it will easily fit into a small storage bag inside my backpack Im pleased 
Arrived quickly and works as advertised Good product still a good price 
Sturdy and easy to use We like that it can be raised or lowered according to our needs Staked it down and it remained in place Recommend it 
Excellent lantern standhigh quality with a basic design Also lightweight and easy to lug around in the carry bag 
It wet Good perfect Thank You Steveg 
While the Amazon price is great this lightweight aluminum mess kit is just not good enough for heavy camping use We also bought the more expensivenbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefTexsportStainlessSteelMessKitdpB000P9IR6KrefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTF8Texsport Stainless Steel Mess Kitanbspand are much happier with that kit Here are my observations on this disappointing Coleman Kit Pros   Folds up nicely for easy transporting  Mug is actually kinda nice Cons   Frying Pan handle is secured in place with a wingnut and is so thin that it bends with any weight in the pan  Pot Lid is flimsy and poorly fitting Not Recommended CFH 
this is a great set for camping it all packs in itself and needs very little space in your pack 
This looked like a good buy for a camp mess kit Unfortunately it is hard to open and close because the handle that holds every thing in is held by a screw I found it hard to open and I overloosened the screw which then dropped out of the handle and I could not find it The kit was hard to put back together anyway as the pot handle didnt fold right Not a good buy I recommend that if one purchases a mess kit that they get one which the handle folds rather than screws together The handle makes it easy to use and a folding handle is easy to open and there are no parts that can be lost 
I bought this as I went through a backpacking phase and spent a lot of time perfecting alcohol stoves I got this at walmart for about 11 which seemed like a deal The problem is they dont stand up to any kind of use The plastic lid on the pan lid would get soft enough every time I used it to cover boiling water that it would deform to the touch Everything bent If you put food in a pan it would bend If you set a pot of water boiling on an alcohol stove the outer edges will lower and bend down After a couple uses the lid didnt fit anything and I didnt trust anything to hold food without causing an accident 
purchased as a gift for someone who really wanted this item sure hell love it 
It works ok but doesnt keep gnats out You also cant tighten around the neck The mesh isnt very fine so the gnats can fly in and out Havent needed for mosquitos so cant judge about that If I was to buy again I would want something with a finer mesh and ability to tighten around neck 
good for the money bought 3 still going strong thanks 
lite weight easy to see through easy to pack 
A must in the woods 
Awesome 
essential for camping in an area where black flies horse flies and mosquitoes are prevalentcheap insurance policy on your comfort 
Good worked perfect but a little bulky for a backpack 
These worked perfectly when I went camping Love it 
Gave it for a gift she likes it 
Works great with a pizza stone 
Not real sturdy The rack doesnt go into the sides of the oven very far so you cant put anything on it thats too heavy like a potato otherwise the rack falls to the bottom 
Very flimsy Didnt hold heat well Arrived damaged 
I bought this for a pack in hunting camp Havent taken it hunting yet seasons not open yet But I did take it on an excursion I love this thing Nothing like being out in the wilderness eating a freshly baked muffin or biscuit Much simpler and more comfortable than using a dutch oven It fit perfectly over one of the burners of my two burner Colman propane stove Like I said its for a pack in camp and so its great how small and compact it folds up I kept the original box so it doesnt get beat up banging around in the panier It does run hotter than the thermometer on the door says some say 5075 difference but I didnt measure it I just let it run at 375ish for biscuits that required 425 and they came out great Even my wife liked them normally shes a Pillsbury fan shes not much for baking mix biscuits I highly recommend this great addition to your camp kitchen 
Awesome camp oven I use this on a two burner gasoline Coleman camp stove I can only get it to a little above 350 but so far that hasnt been a problem Ive made pizzas biscuits muffins and bread so far If you like going the extra mile with your camp cooking and you arent hiking your stuff in this should be in your camp kitchen 
this kit is a joke its so thin and weak i didnt trust the handle and tested it when any weight was put in it the handle bent i dont even want to waste time with this junk on fire it would be full of holes 
Ordered this for my sons boy scout outings I did not expect much when ordering it thought it would just last a year or so and I was right Dented in his Teton Sports pack even though it was on top of everything but easily pushed back into place Everything compacts together nicely though Maybe in a few years will get a real nice one for him 
Its a decent kit A little flimsy and dents from pressure It cleans pretty easily with water Its very light and small The handle of the whole thing is held together with a butterfly nut and screw My biggest problem is that the nut MELTED when put in the fire Now I needa go out and get a real nut to replace it By melted I mean a puddle of metal where it should have been 
This is a great set for UL backpacking at less then 8oz When i go solo I just take the pot with lid which is less then 3 oz Make sure to get a pot grabber 3 1oz to pull the put off the fire bc otherwise youll tip it over or get burned It dented in my pack and the detachable handle isnt sturdy enough to remove the pan when full of waterfood bends but hey its 7 bucks Still havent found anything as light for a reasonable price so im sticking with this Very pleased 
I like this product allot It has every thing you need to have a nice meal in the wilderness The plate is great because I dump my rehydrated meals onto it so I dont get my hands dirty digging the food out of the bag Also the cup is nice because If I want Hot cocoa during the day I can put it right onto my Esbit stove I use a piece of aluminum foil as a lid it works well Some may complain that the cup will burn you but that a warning that your drink is too hot all in all it is a great kit That I always have with me in the woods 
I bought 4 of these bags thinking they would work well for camping when the evening temps droped to 50 Everybody in the family complained of being cold I used mine as cover instead of a bag the double thickness made it warm enough In all fairness I have used it as liner quite sucessfully I put it in a 20 degree bag in tempts of slightly less than 20 Slept on ice pack with a Thermarest pad and was surprisingly comfortable It did feel nice to the touch I really cant recomend this for anything other than sleep overs or a heated caabin type of camping Using as a liner is barely acceptable it adds alot of unnecessary bulk your better off getting a bag thats rated a little lower than expected 
I like this thing originally comes with a strong plastic smell I ripped out the large white instruction tag on the bottom with the washing instructions and it ripped the threading between the fleece part and the zipper lining A bit disappointing you would think they would plan on people ripping that off You can feel the zipper and it is bit uncomfortable when you are sleeping I knew I would get a random color and I ended up with a kind of pea soup green kind of ugly I wish it was darker Packs down to the size of about a football 
For 17 this is a great deal You stay nice and warm and it is plenty big enough for me at 62 and 225 lbs It stows in an included compact carrying case when you dont need it If you move alot get a smooth finished bag because as mentioned you may get tangled as the fleecy texture likes to cling to you 
I took my Girl Scout troop camping over the weekend Knowing it was going to be in the 30s at night I purchased the Fleece Sleeping Bag Liner to help keep me warm It was well worth the purchase Stayed warm and cozy in my sleeping bag 
I bought this in Sept 2010 and have used it multiple times since then It makes a great Spring late summer early Fall sleeping bag by itself I was fine in the mid 50s It is also excellent as a sleeping bag liner for the sub freezing nights if your sleeping bag is not rated that low I am guessing but I would say it adds about 15 degrees of warmth when used as a sleeping bag liner Depends on the individual The fleece is soft and feels fine when touching skin The zipper has worked flawlessly and it has held up after 2  3 washings Fits easily in the provided stuff sack There are better options if you are looking for ultralightbackpacking solutions But overall this does an excellent job 
I bought these for a group of students to use in a warm climate where the air conditioning is decent at best They were very happy with the warmth I would have loved to be able to choose colors on the purchase but for the price I could not beat this 
I dont usually buy from Coleman but decided to try this product out IT WORKS PERFECTLY but only as a liner I would not recommend this as a sleeping bag but as I said it is only a good liner I cant say too much else except buy this as a liner to a good sleeping bag and you will not be disappointed 
I bought this as part of a sale because I love fleese I was very impressed with how warm it did keep me when added to my normal blankets I didnt even wait to try it outside in a sleeping bag It is thin but does provide warmth 
Must have when camping in areas without trees stake it down 
Awesome tool for my gas lantern Works great 
I have been looking for something like this There never seems to be a good place to put my lantern If you spread the legs properly I cant imagine this thing would tip over Heres a good tip Check out the twoway lantern holder on Amazon  Its under four dollars with free shipping  It fits perfectly on the top pole so you could hang something else to counterbalance your lantern Like a bug light or clothing on a hanger 
Good as it can be 
Does the job of holding lantern for maximum light 
Reminds me of my childhood So far so good No complaints 
Coleman has a long and rock solid reputation as the king of car camping But theyve really let themselves slack Ive owned this cooler for close to a decade now and honestly its not that good The lid doesnt stay shut The drain hole has a pathetic little plug and not a screw cap The handles are weak and bend easily And most importantly it doesnt seem to keep things cold very well Its great for short simple things like running to the grocery store but thats about it The Coleman Xtreme coolers do a better job of keeping things cold but they arent that great either 
Coleman products are almost always great but this is not one of them Made out of cheap aluminum it is not sturdy and has no nonstick treatment so cleaning is a pain It basically can be used for one person for cooking a meal but at a little more than a pound its not worth it I wouldnt even buy it as a beginner set for the new camper I recommend the Open Country Sierra 5Piece Nonstick Backpacker Cooking Set It is treated with a nonstick coating on all sides and is lightweight You really dont need more than two pots for cooking a meal for one to four people Always remember  you get what you pay for 
Despite being very light weight this is not worth the money The handle for the pan gets very hot and isnt strong enough The pot when filled with water and lifted from the handle will tilt over sideways and spill water everywhere I did not expect much when I bought it but I had hoped it would at least be functional 
Really for the price this product is a great buy If youre looking for something reliable and functional for long periods of time look elsewhere This is your standard boy scout standard issue mess kit Coleman has never let me down over the years and I still stand by that statement Coleman offers a good backupquality mess kit for a price not ever worth haggling over buy it 
The only thing this kit is useful for is cooking something in another pot or pan and then merely using this kit as a container on which to hold  eat your food Sure its light but it is also horribly made It bends under little pressure and it got warped after the first use so it packs loose and falls apart at the slightest nudge Coleman makes many great products This is just not one of them 
This is a very light and easy to carry aluminum kit In fact it is so light that it got bent a little in my backpack when I went camping The kit IS very flimsy and there is no protection from the heat included I did not dare put it directly on the flame for fear of getting burned so I heated up water on something else If you are going to get this I recommend that you buy some protective gear things gloves etc All in all it served its purpose I just needed hot water But if you need a mess kit to last a while this is not the item for you This one does not seem very durable 
Product as described havent used this much but its easy to put on and off and it does work thank you seller 
Kept the insects off of me during a hunt as expected I simply put on a hat put this over it and tucked it into my shirt 
Way too small 
does what it is intended to 
Good Quality 
Worked excellent easy to use 
I use it all the time It feels like its going to topple on uneven surfaces but I dont think theres a way around that given the design 
The stove looks good but it does not include the propane cylinder shown on Amazon and the Seller cleverly hides that fact by forcing you to click the description if you want to see the last three features Caveat emptor  
Chinese Coleman Hardly Construction seems to be OK but it is Chinese quality not the quality I have come to expect from Coleman USA products 
Just got back from a 5 week trip on my sailboat and used this little gem a lot Its made of steel not aluminum as some have stated It works great on a non pressurized alcohol stove and a pressurized one It also heated the boat nicely I made biscuits and muffins in it and learned to shorten cooking time a bit because the guage reads lower than actual temperature I suspect its because of its location on the door Most of the heat comes off the top so I purchased a 12x12 inch piece of carbonized felt to set on top of the oven It weighs nothing and holds the heat in so you can throttle down the stove and save fuel Im really pleased with this thing being able to fold up too Im looking for excuses to go cook on the boat now LOL 
Its a colemanwhat else needs to be said A name brand that has stood its test of time and one I will always buy Good price 
This was on sale  Christmas but the order got messed up So ended up paying a little more Still 90 less than in our area Great cooler Just threw away my first steelbelted cooler Had to be at least 50 years old It would still keep things cold for a week or more but leaked 
Good deal wlightning deal Very nice cooler Now I wanted some super cool stickers to put on it Love the green color This will be our new beer cooler 
Great addition to take along on your next camping trip Extra tent stakes always come in handy The only item missing is a small tent repair kit but that can be added easily You will probably pay more if you try to purchase all of these items separately 
bought it Took it to the boundary waters Never used it 
What a relief this can provide 
I hate wearing it but it kept the bugs off Maybe use it with a hate with a brim 
Boy this thing has saved my sanity on many occasions Fits good keeps bugs away Seems well made no complaints as of yet The price was excellent by the way 
I love this We live in Nashville and do a lot of outdoor activities In the summer there are a lot of insects This keeps them out of my face ears hairyou get the picture It isnt pretty the top is camouflage The netting is green 
Great for keeping the little buggers off my head 
Gets too heavy with a lantern but survived to take another trip soon 
as described and fast shipping 
great oven I cooked cookies in it on a campout I will say its hard to get the coleman stove to get the temp just right but thats not the ovens fault but the coleman stove just has a sensitive adjustment valve 
Works well if you can regulate the temperature 
Absolutely love this oven I would give it a 5 if there was some insulation to go around it My first attempt at corn muffins took an awful lot of heat adjusting but only because of the gusty wind conditions  the heat was getting sucked out I presume The next day I made blueberry muffins  no wind I never had to make any adjustments once it was up to temp 
Awesome product  delivery time was clear and delivered on time 
Awesome classic cooler 
latch broke first day 
latch broke day 1 
Works great Build quality is solid Can use any brand propane tank simiar to the Green Coleman mini tank My local harware store had different brand but fit like the OEM coleman tank Went camping for 3 days used it about 2 hours total and the one can is still gling strong 
Worked great 
As advertised 
Ill write a more detailed review when I use it It was well packaged and appears to be as advertised Looks easy to set up and use Doesnt take a lot of space taken down I look forward to using it 
Excellent productGas Control is tops 
Fits over my boonie perfect 
only small hat fits properly 
It works 
Functionally  This thing inflates AND deflates low pressure things stuff you could blow up with lung effort in a snap Filled a double height queen bed in about 4 minutes and deflated it in about the same This will not pump anything like carbike tires or basketballs or footballs Comes with nozzles to adapt to most anything you might find around the pool Acoustically  It is incredibly loud Its most like tipping your vacuum cleaner back and putting your head beside it Yes its that loud My kids left the room while it was in use Structurally  The bearings on it suck eggs After using it a few times it kind of sounded buzzy and emitted the occasional screech 
Used a lot on wood stove during power outages Did as expected 
Fun to use camping Adds a extra element to meals 
be sure to stake it down on all 3 legs Wind will blow it over if you dont 
Ive had a lot of friends using these and wanted one I used it the day I received it to make dinner It takes a little longer than a stove but it did the job It can hold a lot of weight on the burner cylinder combination without fear of it falling over I wouldnt try to stir on it as your pot may fall off of it I will say its easy to move and sturdy Much better than a camp stove to move about 
Good price I keep 2 at the house for emergencies 
Excellent for Camping 
We liked the unit but am going back to our old stove This is a little unstabe 
After receiving a replacement because the first one did not include a baking rack my finger was deeply cut by the VERY sharp edge of the metal box Not a good way to start huh So after a few days of healing the replacement unit was unfolded and assembledbut not easily The metal tabs did not align properly and the top was slightly bowed this made for a very frustrating ordeal not unlike wackamole as one tab would come out as the others were inserted The problem was fixed after using a pair of needle nose pliers and pushing from the inside to seat each tab tada Now for the cooking part I use this on a Camp Chef and it heated up quickly and cooks very hot on low Ergo the cobbler bread and polenta had rather toasty undersides but other than that the food was cooked evenly and on time My caveats are this WEAR gloves when removing and assembling and check for sharp edges practice a few times empty to find out how it functions with your particular stove place a small cooking stone in the bottom to diffuse the heat and avoid scorching This a a real hot boxhurt locker so be very careful to avoid touching it while cooking and wear hand and arm protection when removing foods My last recommendation is once it is assembled leave it that way until it needs to be stored or transported Otherwise keep the first aid kit or band aids handy This product fills a cooking niche that can improve camp cuisine or reduce kitchen heat in the summer if properly and safely used 
Must have wood stove on highest heat possible for it to work 
I got these to hold down a beach tent that came with wire tent stakes These will certainly do the job but they are long which will make a solid hold but will require more work getting them in and out Also pick up a rubber mallet if you dont already have one 
I bought these stakes from WalMart on the clearance rack for 2 There is a reason they are priced so low One of the stakes bent very badly when it struck a rock about 4 inches into the soil The Paracord does not fit very easily around the hook and the head of the stake is rather small not very good for driving them into the ground They are also too narrowwider is better with the plastic stakesnbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefCoghlans93099AbsTentPegdpB004D8MZ6CrefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTF8Coghlans 9309 9 Abs Tent Peganbspare much better and more durable They are much better quality and I have used them many times with great success To sum up at the end of the day there are better quality stakes out there for just a little more money However they will work in soft soil if you cant jump to spend the extra few bucks 
Love this cooler It fits SO much inside of it and stays cold for long periods of time 
Nice cooler  all strapped in the RZR and ready to go 
one of the better looking coolers using mine for an indoor kept cigar coolidor though so wanted something with a little style 
Got this on prime day for use at work Works as expected 
Works as expected 
Flimsy and useless 
We love it It works great BUT if the wind blows the wrong way it will unscrew the lantern stand and the lantern WILL drop down BUT its the only decent lantern stand you can buy which makes it a MUST HAVE for camping 
Works as advertised For the largest of lanterns you may not want to put it up to it full extension as it will tip if bumped Les than full height is OK as lantern dont direct their down but sideways You can adjust the spread of the legs to maximize stability Also it come with stakes so if the ground will permit it is a good idea to put the stakes into the feet to avoid a tip and bump Product is sturdy constructed I heartily recommend 
great 
We love this We have a travel air mattress with a base it didnt come with a pump so we got this Its relatively fast quiet enough and smallconvenient We actually just threw away the box and we store it rolled up in the air mattress youd never know it was there If you plan on using this for camping make sure to pick up a power inverter for the car  Highly recommend this  makes using an air mattress so much easier 
Worked well enough 
Works great used a lot in camping gets tossed around still works 
Who said you couldnt bake while you are camping Cool camp oven 
great oven just read the reviews most people are very satisfied like me portability  
Not sure you would want to do a suflay in it but for camping it will work well It is made to be way more durable than I expected but kind of heavy Even if you had to use a camp fire it would work I like it 
cant wait to try it  
Replacement for one originally purchased in the 80s Always works well with my vintage 3burner Coleman stove Nothing like biscuitsngravy in the morning 
very useful in the woods keeps bugs out of your ears and off your face and neck Also good to carry stolen apples in 
I like it 
This handsome and sturdy Coleman cooler is over all a better product than our similar Coleman chest it has replaced That chest lasted for at least fifteen years of camping trips travel and weekly runs to the grocery store and the meat market The new chest has a tighter seal around the rim and a more positive rotary lock True this cooler is not designed for bouncing around a truck bed Neither is any cooler comparable to a good refrigerator for keeping things cold Shoppers who do not require big and tough coolers holding lots of ice or dry ice for extended trips and who do not want to pay Yeti level prices will find this Coleman cooler to be useful and a reasonable value 
Glad I ponyed up because the style is worth it Latch is sturdy and locks after a full swivel A bit heavy but fits a lot and looks SO SHARP Camping in style  
Great Cooler Looks nice and holds cold very well This is probably one of the best coolers I have ever owned Got on sale from Amazon at 4999 Can really match up with any more expensive coolers 
requires some kind of HAT 
good insect net Kept the bugs off me all week 
It is kind of small for me and does not cover shoulderneck area completely if I move around I ended up making one myself using the bridal material and it worked well 
Great protection Good quality 
This works extremely well However my husband says I look geeky and that Im freaking out little kids when I wear this on our walks I think he is exaggerating It keeps gnats and mosquitos off of my head face and neck and I couldnt be more pleased 
I had thought about getting one of these for years but I always put it off thinking it was too flimsy to be useful But on a lark I decided to get one after reading many favorable reviews As an oven it works fine It is flimsy and it is heavier than I expected But it works I have used it and Im impressed with how well it does Now if it just holds together through a few seasons of camping Ill be pleased 
great 
As expected 
Excellent purchase for camping andor off grid baking Have baked bread cakes casseroles etc I do recommend it For the price you will not find a better product 
good 
Sturdy and tough works great  Nuff said 
Know that this doesnt have continuous flame control it has a stepped control lowmediumhigh that doesnt allow the flame to be turned down low enough to simmer rice wo burning it The pictureinformation about the stove doesnt tell you that I like the regulator on this stove better than cheaper stoves but I dont know why Coleman doesnt make these with a fullyadjustable flame control Ill have to go with the junky Wallyworld version that does 
Camp stove works as advertised I unfortunately purchased this when I first got in to backpacking without doing any research This stove is big and heavy and best suited for camping out of a car and not out of a backpack Works good tho 
This was a huge disappointment The Propane valve screws through the pot holder to the burner Mine would not stay together Not good when that is the only thing that holds the grate to the base Maybe I got a bad one I dont know But this cost me more time working on it than Ive ever got to use it 
We had a great camping trip using it know that it does not come with the gas tank 
A must for a campsite Pleased so far Very light weight be careful not to knock over I would buy again 
Very surprised with the quality of this stand considering the sale price of 25 Comes in a nice case and 3 ground stakes which seem more than sufficient given the wide spread of the legs Lantern hook flips into top pole for storage Very nice 
Great addition to our camping gear Allows us to hang our lantern anywhere we need light and the height allows for better elimination 
Very handy 
I like this stand it holds my lantern fine 
It was a gift for newly wed outdoorsy couple They loved it 
works 
Good size and has a drain Just what I was looking for 
Looks great works great Sturdy handles and a lid that locks 
Very useful tool for immediate inflate and deflate an air bed 
You need this for air mattress This works efficiently for inflating and deflating Happy with purchase Wish it had a case to hold pump and nozzles The box it came in fell apart quickly 
ok 
Great 
Great 
I used these to stake down a fence to keep rodents out of my garden and believe it or not to keep my dogs in the yard They work very well Strong enough to hold well in the ground even when pushed on 
Ok 
Very Nice product no complaints  
We have some nasty bugsflies that swarm around you and dearly love to go up your nose in your eyes and ears  so although I do not like wearing this item I would recommend it if you want to be outside and keep your sanity 
is wut it isbig enough to reach to the bottom of my neckwhile having it pulled over a big ass sun hat 
Works as expected Good construction on the burner 
Use it all the time even when I lose power at home 
This little stove is a lot bigger and a lot heavier than Im used to Ive always used something small like the pocket rocket if you plan on using heavy pots and pans this is the way to go I never felt safe putting anything heavy on the rocket this stove will stand up to anything you put on it 
larger than expected Have not tried it out in the field yet Will update the review after tent camping 
Works as it should wonderful for camping 
This camp oven works surprisingly well It takes a little practice to get a feel for their heat level is inside It does have a thermometer but it runs a little hot All things considered its really great for a camp It makes biscuits and cinnamon rolls very well 
The front latch is bad Lock it can still open it Love the looks Will look into a latch replacement 
Actually better built than the older model The steel belted lasted about 20 yrs before the plastic on the lower outside started cracking It actually could still be used still water tight 
great cooler looks good has a latch and metal handles that use to strap down the cooler and still have acces to the lid 
This definitely needs staking down Its handy but a bit flimsy 
I really like the sturdiness of my Coleman Lantern Stand I just gave it four stars becuase the hook came to me bent and I had to have my husband straighten it out Other than that everything else worked perfect 
Absolutely the best lantern stand 
Great I use it camping and when our electricity went out we had this to hang out lantern on made all the difference 
Works very good If used outdoors be sure to stake it down The supplied stakes are fair but I have also bought the 10 nail stakes The stand with lantern were doing well until a just of wind blew it over Lantern survived but the mantles had to be replaced and a new glass globe installed Overall my learning experience cost about 14 for not using any stakes 
This kit is very handy to have on camping trips The mesh bag makes for a challenge when trying to put away several of the items in this kit But the stakes are actually quite sturdy and the mallet works well 
Works fine Sturdy so far Hammer works I pull out the stakes on the metal  I am not sure the plastic would stay intact for very long if you try to pull on them 
Great inexpensive kit 
Product is as expected 
The tube could be a bit longer If you wear it and move around it will expose some skin and depending where u are you will get bitten 
Experienced the worst mosquitos Ive ever seen and this protected us Make sure you have a hat to put under it so that the mesh isnt resting on your skin anywhere 
Of course you must use the head net with a hat otherwise the net will stick to your face and neck allowing insects to penetrate the skin directly but it works well 
Works as expected 
Great stakes at a great off season price 
Great product Fast delivery 
looks OK havent tried yet 
Used these stakes on 26day Alaska Brooks Range paddling trip They worked well on my applications but broke three when pounding into gravel bar Dont seem to be as strong as other older fiberglass pegs from the 1980s Well see how the UV affects them over time and will update 
Total crap Broke the first time I used it 110 would recommend 
Used to sand stake a rainfly for a hammock Small metal stakes provided were inadequate in sandy on a camping trip to the beach Worked great but take up a lot of room in the backpack 
good quality 
makes a nice hot uniform flame Would like more settings for proper adjustment but it worksfine good price 
Essential device to compliment my camping toaster 
Easy to use Had a hard time trying to boil water on my camp stove for coffee because it was so windy Switched to this and had coffee in less than 10 minutes 
Works well 
perfect for the coffee pot in the morning even scrambled eggs over it 
Always been a fan of this oven We had one as a kid We have used our new one car camping on many occasions and make bisquits bread and even pizza 
Had to tweak it Put a 75 inch pizza stone I found on Amazon on the floor which acts as a heat sink and more evenly dissipates the heat Made a cozy out of fire resistant non fiberglass insulation Snaked my high end BBQSmoker temp probe down into slot on top to see what temps really are and discovered the thermometer on the door was reading about 75 degrees lower than actual temp But knowing what the temps actually were I was able to bake up a tray of biscuits in the 18 to 20 min recipe called for and they were done to perfection I had to preheat the oven for 20 min to get to the recommended 425 degrees It was 40 degrees outside and a little breezy Used my Coleman liquid fuel stove With the cozy insulating the oven I barely needed a flame to maintain 425 degrees once it preheated 
Bought it for camping used it when the power went out 
Glad we bought it Like how it folds to make it easy to store 
How can you go wrong with Coleman 
Great price awesome cooler Thank You Amazon 
3 stars because it looks really cool Ice retention especially on hot days is terrible Forget about using it in the sun on a hot summer day Your ice will melt very quickly The lid doesnt stay closed very well either This is great for fall camping or outdoor parties on cooler days 
I purchased this to turn into a jockey box This is a well made solid cooler which fits great with my 2 120ft stainless coils inside 
Great product so far it works well in Texas Heat I get a full 34 days before I have to replenish the ice It will not keep ice for that long if if is kept in direct sunlight 
This is the second that I have boughten I have the silver one and now that My dad bought a new red Ford I have a cooler for him to match Although the cooler is better built then the truck 
Pump works as advertised 
item as described happy with my purchase 
Must have Sped things up and kept the inside of my tent clean 
Inflates fast and no issues Bought the cordless one too for car camping 
If you have any two burner stove you NEED this 
I like it 
Its convenient 
Worked as described Took with us up north to northern WI Kept mosquitos away 
Works great for midwest summers in the lawn 
so handy when hiking to keep the pesky gnats from buzzing around your face head amazing how that can drive a person crazy this makes life a lot eaasier 
Great 
Fairly comfortable durable low expense Very effective 
A good quality cooler love it Looks and functionality galore 
Worth every penny Replaced an old plastic cooler prior to last camping trip with this one and it is so much better Had one almost identical growing up and it is well worth the extra change to get a quality product that will last many years 
Hey its a burner Takes up no space and its there when the power goes out Should be in every disaster kit for the price 
Great 
Good for camping and power failures 
The stove top is very efficient and plenary hot quickly The drawback is the tank contains less propane than before Lasts very little time 
may be not the most highteck and lightest but for small to medium tens they are great 
Not the bright yellow color shown but a dirty brown that blends in with the ground Of the dozen I purchased three broke as we tried pitching our tent We were only using a rubber mallet and they simply broke into several pieces Will try the Coghlans ones next time Coleman products do not always deserve the reputation their names suggests 
Very sturdy just what we wanted 
Far better than those thin metal stakes that dont hold for very long 
a plastic stake Yup 
Good quality but I will be adding paracord to them so that I can pull them from the ground 
 
The stakes are long enough for my purpose 
Just stashed it with my tent ready to go camping 
works as expected 
Works really fast 
Nice to have on hand 
Exactly as pictured  works great for us 
Very effective and convenient to use when traveling in Asia Easily see through the net Fit perfectly over my safari hat will take it traveling everywhere now 
Who wants black flies biting and swarming around their head I dont so I got this for the times when they are out Yes you will look goofy but you wont be scratching or swinging your arms around at the darn bugs So now I can work on the trail and not be too bothered Great price too 
Light weight and so useful Very happy to have found these 
What a simple yet functional item It must be great for camping but I am using it in my house on top of my stove rather than putting on my big oven just to make 6 corn muffins or something small like that I put it over one burner on my range and it heated up to 400 in about 710 minutes I saw The inside rack can be put in 3 positions as you can see in the picture On my first attempt I put the rack in the top position and baked corn muffins They didnt brown but were moist and delicious in just 15 minutes time Next time out Ill put the rack and the muffin tray in the lower position This thing is so versatile and will be economical for house use since I wont have to be putting on my gas guzzling oven for small items I went to Youtube and found a bunch of videos showing what other people are cooking in this Hey one guy baked a small loaf of bread in it Amazing But as I also found out on Youtube the thermometer on the outside of the door is not accurate So I got a small thermometer for the inside of the oven to get a more accurate reading which is especially important for baked goods since there could be a 75 degree difference between the thermometers My only complaint is the assembly There are 4 nibs on each side panel that have to slip into the top flap and the bottom flap of the oven and after the first use I found it very difficult to get them all to attach again Perhaps the heat from the previous usage warped the bottom panel 
Its usually pretty hard to go wrong with something Coleman branded This little oven has always struck me as cheesy But I finally broke down And it worked well Did a great job on bread and muffins during a recent camping trip 
Ive now cooked with this 10 times Im unimpressed with the build quality My little latches that hold the bottom and top in place are a pain to latch Without them the thing falls apart It cooks ok I use it on my Coleman camp stove But its hard to hold a temperature Goes up Goes down But hard to hold at say 350 degrees And the thing seems so flimsy When closed up the latches open themselves and then it opens If it was not too late to return it Id return it 
does fine for warming stuff but for baking you have to have it setting over high heat 
Very surprised how well this works Was expecting to have to make modifications based upon others reviews but it works great out of the box for me Cornbread at camp is perfect Even does a nice job on toast Yes its heavy but ingenious how well it collapses Wont car camp without it 
Not bad it is well made and does a decent job 
I used this in the desert last weekend very sturdy for latern and easy to setup and take down would recommend to anyone 
Yeah this thing was a PITA It was difficult for us to set up didnt seem very sturdy and would only hold the most lightweight lantern You really cant use it for anything heavy at all and since it tips over pretty easily we only used it once or twice while camping because it was more effort than it was worth Perhaps it was user error but it was a waste of gear for us 
I am very satisfied Product quality is also very good I will buy again in the future 
Good for their intended purpose I use these in camp with some Ryobi 18v area lanterns The friction joints are plastic so am not sure they will last as long as my old all metal tripod But that could be me wishing for another 25 years of use 
ok 

Huge hit in our camp We made every possible dish we would at home Other than the size limitations duh its PERFECT 
Great 
I love this oven Our RV doesnt have one so I miss baking Im not one to use the microwave Comes together quick I first tried it on top of My kitchen gas burner as an experiment This is the ideal situation So what about using it outside on a windy day We put it on our gas grill outside and had to add wind breakers like large pieces of tile since they were close by I made Blueberry Cobbler but I had to keep watch of the temperature gauge as it fluctuated in the wind I The Cobbler baked very well took less time then recipe I then decided to try it in our RV on our next camping trip The biscuits came out really good as did the pizza for super Again keep a watchful eye on the temperature gauge 
I purchased this item to wear when I go fishing or work in the yard Item works fine Although the item arrived within the allotted time it still took a while for it to arrive I plan on purchasing several more but next time I will go with a company that will ship sooner 
Well it works of you dont like being bugged then get this I use it for fishing does a great job 
Ive been using this product almost every afternoon when I take about a 3 hour hike through the woods and so far so good As long as you try to be diligent on not catching the head net on branches and stuff this product should last you a great long while I would recommend this to anyone who is like me and prefers to not wear DEET bug sprays 
Depending on the hat you use  since it recommends using a full brim hat  it might not reach as low as you want it The elastic only comes to the middle of my neck on a 725 hat with a 2 brim 
Nice camping kit I ended up buying another 4 pack of the tent stakes to go with it The mesh bag that it comes in is pretty much useless for the tent stakes as they poke right thru but it could be repurposed Loved having the mallet to pound in the stakes worked like a charm And the mini broom and dust pan was great for sweeping out my Honda Element However I never quite figured out how to use the stake puller Oh and be prepared for the mallet to out gas a nasty strong rubber smell I kept it wrapped in the plastic bag it came in and stored it in my camp set up rubbermaid box That kept it from making the inside of the Element reek of rubber 
They work good but have a heavy chemical smell that will make your whole house smell It is horrible 
As other reviewers have said this mallet stinks Literally It smells awful Im not sensitive to smells so I thought I might not have an issue with it but its bad Ive had it sitting on my deck for three weeks and its still off gassing The rest of the components are convenient and nice to have Coleman needs to replace that mallet though 
Cool 
I love these stakes They stay in the ground better than any other ones Ive tried and they work for easy ups as well as tents 
GOOD 
I had one of these burners way back but I lost it somewhere along the line while moving These are great for camping or when the power goes out Large enough for regular sized pots and pans but small enough to stow away when not in use Heats really well and evenly just like a regular gas burner 
No problems with this stove Some reviews had me worried Great product works well for car camping Sets up quick and heats a varying temps Mostly used for water and soup The wind wasnt a terrible problem sitting next to it while cooking blocked enough wind Another reviewer said the knob is counter intuitive It is not Righty tighty lefty loosey Left opens and right closes the valve This is like most home stoves 
Really handy to have for when the weather dips too cold for butane Handy back upaddition to the white gas stove 
Very nice Bought three 
Seems great so far I was a bit worried that it wouldnt be able to support the amount of weight I needed it to but after it came Im not worried at all This seems more sturdy than many have suggested The ability to stake it down is a definite plus in improving the stability when extended very far 
Todays campgrounds wont allow nails in the trees to hang anything including a lantern Even if they did trees are usually not where you would like to put a lantern plus the tree blocks half the area the light would be able to shine Now I can place my lantern where I want with my camp chair Works very well when fishing on a shoreline Stows very small 
You will HAVE to use stakes Every time They need to add a fourth leg for stability That said they are quite handy and getting the light up is nice 
A very nice lantern stand Quality construction Works well with a Coleman Northstar lantern One needs to use the stakes when extending it to its maximum height 
I purchased this to inflate my 13 ft raft It has 21 inch tubes 4 main air chambers and two thwarts I plugged it into my toyota tacoma inverter which is rated at 400 watts with vehicle running Pump worked great took me about 10 minutes to inflate the raft I hardened off the raft with a hand pump just for control of the final pressure but pump appeared to have pleanty of PSI to do the job just didnt want to overinflate I did have to use a hose from one of my hand pumps to hook to the pump so it would fit the raft valve correctly but that was not a big deal to me and it connected easily 
Arrived on time and in new condition Over 10 cheaper here on Amazon compared to my local sporting goods and it was delivered to my door The stove was heavier which Im happy about than I thought it would be and was very easy to setup took about 30 sec Nothing feels cheap about the oven and the builtin thermometer kept track of my temp well I used it on a Coleman two burner stove and it kept my desired temp well Hint for people with kerosene heaters cylinder type with the outer cage It works just as good on top of my heater which I was very happy with Well worth the money 
An addition to our camping equipment 
after figuring out the exact heating it worked great 
Affordable and works great for an occasional outdoor people like us 
We didnt really need this but I thought it would be nice to have just in case This comes with extra heavy duty stakes a large mallet and a broom and dustpan for the tent Its inexpensive and gives piece of mind if you happen to need it 
Great 
Everything else but the hammer is fantastic 
works great wish cord was longer 

I dont know of any other outdoor propane burner that handles wind as well as this one It also gets hot enough to sear a steak like a pro 
Going into my vehicle emergency kit 
very good 
Great product on time delivery 
Ive used these Coleman Camp Ovens for almost 30 years  and I love them Ya gotta spend a little time with them get used to how they bake but once you do you can put out some killer camp meals Highly recommend 
We used this oven on a seven week RV trip this summer and it worked wonderfully Our camper trailer does not have an oven and we used this oven both on our outside Coleman stove and inside on the camper stove We cooked biscuits and sweet rolls with it 
I got six years service out of the first one before the battery failed and the next model was identical except the color so they appear to know that it was a good design It will blow up several air mattress quickly and on one charge 
I got this for a few bucks got two actually i wanted a boonie hat with this attached and they can cost upwards of 20 to 30 USD I had a black boonie hat already cost me 9 and this cost just over 2 It Does indeed fit nicely over my boonie hat and the draw string is nice and simple does not keep rain out but Duh  that is why i got the hat I recommend 
I guess for the price I was expecting too much The head net arrived and I found it to be very short It fits for the most part against your face instead of much space between the mask and your face A critter can still bite you through the holes if the net is against your face Further the net is short It just and I mean barely comes to the base of your neck in length If you turn your head or look up or down sharply your neck becomes uncovered In a pinch this will do if you arent planning on spending a lot of time where bugs are But if you are going on a fishing trip up north or out west where the bugs swarm forget it Buy a better quality net You wont regret it 
With the the summer coming so do the bugs This insect Head Net perfectly matches the Columbia Bora Bora Booney II Sun Hats Sage One Size The brim of the hat is just long enough to keep the net off my face and maintain nice visibility Very pleased with this product 
Without a brim to keep the net off of your head those mosquitos will simply bite thru the net As soon as you get a brim to keep the net off of you it works rather well 
I received the head netwear the bugs havent got thick yet so Ill review it when I start getting those pesty bugs 
Head nets are a must when working in insectfilled environments This tool help save you from a lot of bites and such that would otherwise be annoying as they could be dangerous depending on where you are at Easy to employ and simple to wear its a musthave if youre going to be working anywhere near bugs Its affordable anyone in the family can use it it works and it doesnt break the bank Whats more to know 
I went fishing in Alaska and used this head net to keep away the mosquitos and flies It was a lifesaver Cant imagine being somewhere like that without at least one of these I did feel dorky wearing it at first but when I had it on I wasnt bothered by the bugs at all Easily fit over the brim of my hat and didnt tear easily Ill buy another one as a spare for my next trip 
Great quality 
Use a pair of these for my camp kitchen love them 
Had one already and wanted another 
Works as advertised Great for an inexpensive compact alternative to my Coleman 2 burner stove 
perfect addition to camping kit and for use as back up cooking in emergency situations hi btu output great flame adjustment 

Im very happy with the product 
Worked Great 
At first I couldnt understand why people would buy this Not being a super camper and all I just grabbed it because of the cost Im glad I did The stakes made ALL the difference on our trip because it was wet wet wet As we only had 4 large stakes I used the ones that came with the tent for everything else and they did ok but we had a few pop up after a while because the ground was just soaking wet This was not an issue for these large stakes 
Really bad quality not strong enough for the purpose its sold 
GREAT KIT A MUST FOR ANOYNE GOING CAMPING IN SEVERE WEATHER CONDITIONS 
Excellent product I love it 
I have wanted a Coleman oven for a long time I have used this oven a few times and it works great Easy to set up and break down quickly One trick that I have found is to heat the oven gradually instead of full flame at first less you burn your goods The thermometer works accurately Great for home use as well as camping and a fun item to use Worthy of the Coleman name 
This worked well with the stove we purchased Biscuits monkey bread muffins Im going to try a whole chicken in it but as of yet have not As long as you pay attention to what you are doing this is a really useful item light packs flat Many other campers inquired about it 
This is a wonderful product to buy 
the pump is a beautiful red pump and it is very easy to use to blow up my Coleman mattresses I will order again from seller 
This is amazing for putting up and taking down air mattresses which is the only thing I have every used it for The packaging was really good and the shipping was fantastic I have had no problems at all with this in the last 2 years I have had it 
This is the cooler youve been looking for I have a couple of these now for camping I got different colors to distinguish their contents But seriously these keep ice for three days out in the sun and heat And they look awesome I put the magnets of where I camp or fish on them to let everyone know whats up too 
Perfect camping stove Doesnt take up the room of a 2 burner and cooks fast Im a novice and was able to use it to make breakfast in just a few minutes 
Works great 
Great kit 
So far so good Does what its supposed to do The adjustable height is very convenient I can set the lantern lower when Im cooking over the fire I recommend staking the legs down when using a heavier lantern so the stand is more stable Giving 4 stars instead of 5 because I think the price is on the high side for what youre getting IMHO 
Works very well I used it with the heavy dual fuel powerhouse Coleman lantern and the weight of the lantern did not effect it at all 
This is great for any very hot lantern The only thing is the stakes provided are kind of flimsyI made my own 
I used this over the weekend on a 4 day camping trip The stand is pretty solid It actually stands quite tall  over 7 feet so the distribution of light around the campsite was great Its very sturdy and the legs are curved at the tip to easily accomodate stakes which I really didnt need I highly recommend the product 
I always have these in the summer hunting and packing just cheap netting that really helps beat the flying bugs Worth it 
I figured this would be a throwaway because of the price but not true Very well made and can be used over and over The only reason it looks so big in picture is because it is to be warn on top of a hatcap 
It is thin Probably not a product that will last more than several uses I bought it for a survivable pack 
Pretty big net Fits over my big head with a baseball hat on Overall I am satisfied with my purchase I dont think this net is of supreme quality but should get the job done 
I suggest having a couple of these for each person May help get some sleep on the move These are lightweight and compact I am not so sure it is noseeum proof but until the spring I will test it for sure at that time and know for sure Prepping sometimes requires items in pairs I think this would be one of them 
I have not had to use this but I carry it with me on every hike It is a great piece of gear that gives me a bit of piece of mind 
I bought this to throw over my laptop screen if there is too much glare from a nearby window It doesnt work so hot and I look pretty foolish when I do it in a coffee shop or library But if either place gets infested by gnats Im ready for them Ill then put this over my head so they cant get in my ears and mouth 
Ive seen these around forever  never believed this oven would work  Im a convert now  this little oven worked perfectly  
I used this to bake bread in a small cast iron Dutch oven placed inside it and heated over a propane Coleman stove The resulting bread was as good or better than expected There are two reasons I marked it 4 stars and I did contemplate 3 stars The temperature gauge is way off As I was preheating it to bake the bread I found it was really struggling to get over 400dF when I needed it to be 475 All the while it was smoking as I expected and seemed awfully hot  after all it was over a 10000 BTU burner on high I put a separate oven thermometer inside and closed the door It was well over 600dF Once I got the bread inside after cooling it to 475 I could watch the oven temp gauge outside after matching it to the right number inside My second issue is that because I was unknowingly heating it so high there was some minor warping afterwards Otherwise I think the oven is well conceived well priced and adequately constructed Fix the gauge and you have a winner 
Worked great with backpacking stove on rafting trip 
Everything you hear about the latch in the other reviews is true I dont know what Coleman was thinking by replacing that old school latch this one is flimsy an pathetic Terribly disappointed If you can find an antique steel Coleman try and figure out how to switch latches with the new one shame on you Coleman 
Classic design that should last forever 
What a classic This model cooler reminds me of the one I grew up with through the 50s and 60s I especially appreciate the locking lid and the dependable quality Ive come to expect of Coleman products 
I avoided this stove in the past because I didnt want to be buying disposable tanks Then I found a valve that allows you to refill them 
abused one for 15 years until it rusted out just ordered another 
Reason being is not only could you get attachment for large propane tank its like a bit er on gas stove it catch all skill overs light weight too 
This uses the smaller propane tanks No problem I will just buy the smaller tanks 
awesome product Filled the air beds to capacity within minutes Worked as well as my husbands air compressor 
exelent 
Pump was great Bednot so much 
What do you wanna know really other then it came fast great price works good and yes i would suggest this item to others 
I do quite a bit of bivouac style camping courtesy of the Army and this thing definitely helps when your sleeping under the stars You would definitely want some sort of hat on to wear it during the day to keep it off of your face but its worth it 
The black flies in our part of the Appalachian Trail were horrendous this year This netting made all the difference between hiking and not hiking 
Now that they moved up early bow hunting for deer we have to deal with warm weather And warm weather brings mosquitoes So this works great to keep them out of my face It also doesnt hinder vision at all when Im taking my crucial shot 
Will work perfect over a baseball cap to keep the flies out while hiking Great price Definitely a great buy 
This oven worked really well for me I made Jiffy corn muffins and blueberry muffins in this oven in no time It was a hit of the camping trip It was easy for me to maintain an even temperature This item is not light and I recommend you keep its weight in mind when packing 
I hadnt heard about this oven until finding it on Expedition Portal with glowing reviews At 30 I gave it a shot and have used it for 3 camping weekends thus far Holy moly I cant figure out how we lived without it now It is astonishing how much a pan of cinnamon rolls on a cold morning can change morale I use the oven on a Coleman Grill Stovenbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefColemanPerfectFlowInstaStartGrillStovedpB000BPEE4MrefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTF8Coleman PerfectFlow Insta Start Grill Stovea The trick here is to remove the grill portion and just set the oven right over the burner it prevents the grill from melting and doubles as a nice wind break on the burner I have given up hope on the thermometer so I typically just set a medium flame and monitor the contents until theyre done The grate can be set at 3 heights Higher is better in my opinion helps prevent burned bottoms which Ive had a couple times Id also recommend a dedicated cookware set I bought the Farberware setnbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefFarberwareNonstickBakeware4PieceToasterOvenSetGraydpB008NPUTFArefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTF8Farberware Nonstick Bakeware 4Piece Toaster Oven Set Graya Make sure you have a good oven mitt too so you can pull out hot pans I deducted a star because the details are lacking As I said the thermometer is way off the washer behind the door knob has already fallen apart on me and the latches to hold it together are really easy to bend This isnt a new product so Id like to see Coleman up the quality a bit maybe bump the price 5 or so and call it good It packs small enough that its always with us when car camping With the latch issue mentioned above I wouldnt be surprised if I break something over the summer of camping but Im sure I can kluge it together to keep it going for a while Solid 4 stars and highly recommended for making happy campers 
Seen others use these over Coleman stovesrocket stovescast iron stoves and anything they can put it on which puts out heat Expect to use this over a portable propane grill a roommate gave meas well as campfires while camping 
I bought this to use as a portable hummingbird feeder pole when traveling in our RV Its worked perfectly We spent several weeks camping out in the desert north of Yuma AZ I set this stand up and placed a medium sized rock over each foot to keep the wind from blowing it over It withstood 30 mph winds with no problem The hummingbirds LOVED it 
This stand is great Its light and easy to pack away We use four for the beach with large gatherings They lasted us over a year already using them every Wednesday night 
Very handy tent accessory if your are not hiking into the mountains Oh and you can use for your lanterns too 
I took this stand from the US to Europe since its not available and I was looking to a possibility to have a sturdy stand for our lamp We use it along with the twin mantle dual fuel lamp When the lamp is hanging on it its pretty stable and we have no bad feeling that it might tip Especially since the lamo carries gas I came across the stand since there are at campgrounds no trees in the neighbouhood or the tree nearby is too far away anyway This stand removes these headaches Its quickly folded up and down which is important to us You do not want to spend time in setting up of folding down eqiupment 
works well for what it is a few plastic parts but with care should last some time Great for the price 
Very compact good anchoring system Not many items like these on the market The top could be made firmer but it has not failed over many uses 
The stainless steal burner is nice and thick for many years of use camping or backpacking trips Nice to have when wood for fire is sparse 
works perfectly no problems at all love the stand for the bottle be careful using this though safety first 
Works great and fast for boiling water 
Excellent 
A must have for those how camp or especially those who live in hurricane alley And you peppersthis is a nice alternative to hauling out the camp stove just to make some coffee Mine works greatlarger than you might thinksoa 10 inch skillet or pot will fit nicely 
Im glad I bought this set Every tent comes with its own metal nails but they are so crapy They go in and half way down they bend but this ones dont They were amazing and I wish I would have bought more They do sale them separately for less than a 1 each at home depot so Im definitely going to buy like 20 more before our next camping trip They go down very easily but you definitely need the back of the hammer to get them back out The extra piece is probably to dig them back out but we couldnt find ours They are strong The little broom with tiny dust pan came in handy inside the tent because overtime the names came in they dragged some dirt inside with them 
It is everything it saysbut they smell super plasticish to me I couldnt be in the car with them on the way to camping so they are still airing out in a shed out back 
This is one item to have when working out in the yard I have a lot of nasty insects that love nothing more than to have you make a donation to them  With this on that is no longer a problem It covers your headright down to your neck I put it over my baseball cap and i just go about my business And i dont have to put insect repellent on my face which i really like 
I bought this for my dad and he loves it It does obstruct your view somewhat but that will happen with any full coverage mask You can put up with it or put up with being attacked by a swarm of mosquitos 
Nice addition to our camping gear 
My son is in the Navy and due to frequent moves has a Coleman inflatable bed I bought him this pump so he didnt have to manually blow it up He used it once to inflate the bed and once to deflate the bed A few months later I tried to inflate the bed and the pump shorted out So 2 uses before it died Update It died due to the cord shorting out where it enters the pump Contacted Coleman and they sent a new pump 
more than enough power for the inflatable beds we have  2 twin beds for camping havent used it for anything else like the reverse feature to suck air back out  makes packing up go much faster 
This item was broken never worked from day one Too bad the return window is up 
This Coleman electric pump is fast and reliable I use it to inflate air mattresses and I highly recommend it 
I have had one of these for 10 plus years I use it when I camp alone as I tend to make one pot or pan meals and it has never failed me I purchased a second one that we could use for emergencies power outages etc Remember to only use in a well ventilated area Stand is plenty stable with a 164 oz disposable propane bottle and I have had no problems with a 10 inch fry pan or 4 quart pot Puts out plenty of heat 10000 BTU burner so no issue there I have used it in some pretty windy conditions and the flame can get blown around and affect cooking and boiling times This is not a backpackers stove a little too heavy and the propane bottles add even more weight But its durability simplicity and quality works for me Added Comments after camping with this newer version This one is not the same quality stove  It is nearly impossible to adjust the flame the older version I really liked was a great single burner and all my positive comments apply but the newer ones are only good for boiling water and I am adjusting my review accordingly 
Way better than the cheaper stove I bought from KMart 
Coleman quality on a single burner This things puts out some heat Great for camping 
Im a coffee addicted camper This is a beautiful cheap machine for that picture shows lowest and highest flame setting I had my morning coffee in 5 minutes Should be no problem cooking soups and such on It does come wit b a big warning not to use in tents due to CO poisoning The top of the burner is approximately the size of your hand spread open Easily holds a 6 to 8 inch saucepot 
This stand is a nice addition to my camping gear Lets you put light where you want Dont worry about whether the ground is perfectly level You can even stake it down if its windy or hilly Its easy to setup comes with a nice carry bag Sturdy 
First of all I dont know why but the Coleman lantern stand was the only portable lantern stand I could find on amazon so far Said that I only give it 4 stars because of its locking system You must twist the poles to lock them on the desired lenght So you have to be very carefull when setting it to his max extension unless you are 7 feet tall you will not be able to safely remove the lantern before twisting the poles to shorten their lenght Its a design problem It comes with a thin and cheap bag that will probably dont last long I have read so many bad reviews on this item but I must say that it is not that bad once you hook it safely on the ground it will be of great help during the night I recommend this item only if you cant find a better one And if you do please let me know  
I use this stand for just about anything including holding my outside shower head which is attached to my pop up camper I just velcro it on in a couple of places and Whammooutside shower stand 
This is a great lantern stand Nice to be able to move it around easily and have the light over us rather than beside us 
Got this stand for camping I had a triangle type lantern stand that was a pain to put up and take down the Coleman design is a much better idea A little concerned about the way the pole extends and tightens to keep it up 
Not necessary but the spikes are much better for installation and removal 
I got this kit to supplement my Coleman Sundome tent and Im glad I did The stakes that come with this are superior and held up great The stake puller is a nice tool and it makes it way easier to pull up the stakes The dust pan and broom make cleaning up easy I think its a great kit to have handy 
Just what I needed 
Good for the price I really wanted the handheld stake puller and mini dustpan While the handle on the puller is a bit flimsy but I am relieved not to have to worry about another puller coming off a mallet and the dustpan is very small not the best quality but it gets the job done The mallet is a basic mallet hard to go wrong there and the stakes are good and solid I love there is a carry bag for them as well 
Stakes and puller and low quality I ended up replacing the stakes with ones with metal hook at the end instead of the plastic Plastic snapped on the included ones the first time I tried removing them The puller also easily bends when trying to use it to pull as stake I guess what can you expect for the  though 
I used these before they leak heat badly and I always burned the bottom of stuff before entirely cooked but I was going to try the aluminum wrap trick this time I returned stove so this goes back too For some reason this had an unnecessary hole in the sheet metal side opposite of the door Heavier than what I remembered It isnt worth the hassle for me 
ours bit the dust a long time agofound this whoo hoo i have made dinner and pies w this item 
Delivered as promised 
I bought this to reduce the size of our car camping gear Its great Plenty bright but packs much smaller than the full size lantern We rarely turn it up all the way its too bright The full size lantern is now left at home and may soon end up on Craigslist This is a great improvement over the older style full size lanterns and the one to get If you are car camping two of these are better than one full size lantern I wouldnt backpack with it but I guess some people do They pack in 1lb propane bottles Im not a big guy so for me every ounce counts For backpacking I usually just use my headlamp but I sometimes bring thenbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefSnowPeakGigaPowerLanterndpB000AIGA2OrefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTF8Snow Peak GigaPower Lanterna especially if were in a fire ban area It uses the same fuel as thenbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefSnowPeakGigapowerStovedpB0000E5KPKrefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTF8Snow Peak Gigapower Stovea That Snow Peak Stove Lantern and Fuel together weigh less than this The Snow Peak gear lives in my pack This Coleman lantern lives in my car camping gear 
This is a great compact and economical lamp It also plenty bright enough with just one mantle to illuminate a small campsite The mantles were available at my local WalMart where I bought about 10 just in case they become harder to find later Its a good buy 
It is difficult to determine which lantern is actually best for your camping needs This model uses slipon mantles and matches meaning you have to fuss with strings but it only weighs about one pound for backpacking The single mantle is plenty of light for night use For purists this might be the best but I purchased the Coleman Northstar Instastart TubeMantle Propane Lantern which has two mantles and they are the clipon style which is so much easier than tying on mantles However it does weigh about four pounds For pure lightweight backpacking Id go with this model but if you can stand three more pounds or are carcamping Id recommend the Northstar InstaStart TubeMantle Lantern which also has metal globe guards Either way Coleman is the best 
Works as advertised I also have a Coleman 2 mantle dual fuel lantern and I love them both Only giving it 4 stars because mine does not sit perfectly straight when screwed on the propane bottle meaning its a little off square I am sure no one else has noticed and it does not affect performance but it bothers me enough that i hold back the last star Sorry Coleman Either way its a great little lantern The chain hadle is nice long enough that you wont burn your hand when you are walking around the campground with it 
This single mantle lamp provides plenty of light runs for more hours than I counted on a 16 oz can packs great and uses easily available mantles I have two Many department and sporting good stores carry replacement globes Once used all mantles damage easily A single mantle lamp saves money 
Great cooler wellbuilt 
The photos and description are not clear There is a silver painted model and a true stainless steel model Be certain you are buying the correct one 
Good items of this order really love this item next time i will re order for sure and i will promote to my friends 
It works Need to wear a hat with a brim and you look kinda goofy but not as goofy as that guy sucking bugs up his nose and swatting at everything in the air I back this up with a full clothing spray I tuck it in around the neck Try NOT to have skin up against it where the bugs can get at you and thats where a large brim hat comes in I can stand getting bugs in my nose ears or eyes and stopping breathing is NOT an option Not a good anyway LOL 
all good 
I was looking for a compact burner for my disaster prep locker Looks like I found a winner 
Very compact and works great 

Coleman is the best Great for camping and great for emergency kits Does not have a sparker so youll need matches or a lighter 
like 
The hummer has strong rubber smell It ruins everything If you can resist the smell I think it is nice kit But I could not 
as advertised 
Very impressed with this pack 
great value 
Great pump for my airmattress It was a replacement pump for one that broke It is better than the original pump in that it fills faster and is not as noisy as the previous pump It was inexpensive and has worked great I would buy it again 
Coleman Enough said Durable Easy packing The center rack DOES fit in the collapsed oven for easy packing Baked muffins no problem Im gonna get adventurous and try and bake lasagna and then a small chicken Gonna be the hit of the camp grounds 
Flimsy Didnt care for this product 
We bought this Lantern stand to hang our Coleman white gas lantern on We installed it at our campsite and staked it in the ground It is well over 7 foot tall fully extended We hung the lantern on and fired her up WOW it lit up the whole campground Later that night a couple of women came by and asked for help to lite a campfire they said we looked like professional campers We thought that was cute We are not just campout a couple of times a year This stand is very easy to work a child could do it The last night it rained and we had wind gusts of 35 mph the lantern stayed on and the stand did not move at all A great thing to have as we like to keep the lantern on all night at our campsite It keeps the bears and raccoons away Glad to have it as part of our camping stuff 
Got tired of hoping to find a tree to hang our lanterns on Fortunately I havent caught a tree on fire already also I bought two of these and man am I so glad I did They fold up so easily and has a bag to store it in When unfolded and stood up the stand is awesome The legs stretch far enough where this thing could stand up in very strong winds Very lite weight and made great 
I just got this and it is exactly what I was expecting and will be perfect for camping and festivities 
I purchased one of these Coleman Insect Nets yesterday what a disappointment it does not even resemble the photo on the box or in the adds If I put it over my head it is skin tight That would not work eh For one of these type net to work you have to wear them over a hat with a brim to keep the netting a couple of inches from your skin I cannot get my hat in to this net it is so small Evidently Coleman has changed the producers of this net A few years ago they where big enough Thats why you see some positive reviews on here look at the dates and dont buy this neta datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefColemanInsectHeadNetdpB0009PUSZIrefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTF8Coleman Insect Head Neta 
For anyone who has been chased to the point of exhaustion by swarms of mosquitoes and black flies Or has been the first out on the trail just to find out that all the spiders and worms have silked up the trail for your face to enjoy This with a long sleeve shirt and long pants works better than any bug dope out there 
The top part where it sits on the crown of your head is camoflauge patterned Sort of a dark multicam pattern The mesh material itself isnt very fine Its not Noseeum proof so the smaller insects can get inside The holes are just too big I would presume a juvenile mosquito could if it tried barely squeeze in there but it should hold out the ticks 
Not very clear in the pictures but the top area just over the head is a camo portion that is pretty corny looking its the old school type of camo Other than that its a net and not much more to say 
The mesh looks tiny enough to keep those pesky bugs out and the product is made well so it should hold up to many uses Its a good size for all head shapes and sizes and full enough to keep the wasps and bees stingers away from your skin It doesnt restrict vision either Great for wearing when on the lawn tractor In the hot summer months when the tiny flies are out in full force Great for keeping dust off your face too when you drive the mower over a section of dry soil and it kicks the dust up around you Great product and withstands washing too 
works great 
Boom this burner is awesome Even in gusty winds it stays lit 
Very nifty and easy to use stove Only issue is it definitely got tippy in high winds so we had to hold the pot handle But for convenience and size it cant be beat 
Nice little set 
Nice little kit although I wish it came with 68 tent stakes as opposed to only 4 Much better stakes than come with most tents dont vent when hammered in or pulled out 
Its okay but you get what you pay for 
Great little kit to tuck into your camping supplies Dirt travels when camping  right into your tent 
I cant believe this thing costs as much as it does I had a buddy literally give it to me because he hated it and he knew Id love it because I have an Airstream and love everything Aluminum In my opinion its ok at best As numerous other reviewers mention the latch is poor and doesnt work as intended I also had the top separate at the hinge and had to epoxy it back together I havent had any problems with the drain plug as others have mentioned but I also dont feel like this cooler keeps ice any better than my 50qt Coleman marine cooler or even the Rubbermaid 70qt on wheels we have Ive seen some say its as good as Yeti and thats laughable I used it this past weekend and had to drain and refill the ice every day 
Cant wait for camping season 
Works like a charm I was impressed that it actually worked On our first camping trip with it we baked two coffee cakes in a 5x10 bread tin Only cons are that the door lock was difficult to get functioning properly and the bottom of the box started to warp a bit when the stove burner was set on high keep burner low Still I would recommend 
This camp oven does the job Theres nothing like having stove baked muffins while camping out in the woods 
good deal 
Compact easily assembled and works great Perfect for hiking camping and fishing 
I bought one these because I have several Coleman lanterns and love them so why not get a compact one First off the fact that you have to attach a 1lb tank to the thing makes it not so compact or light Second the mantles are hard to find and expensive The one that came with the lantern didnt work right Ive installed many a mantle on coleman lanterns propane and white gas and never had one look so wimpy and shriveled up like this one does It doesnt burn right and flames are outside of the mantle no holes Replacement mantles are very expensive compared to other mantles and no one seems to have them The only ones I could find are going to take a week to get to me Disappointing 
Do not buy this Total garbage Ive had this out on five occasions The piezo ignition pretty much never worked I wish they were sold without them but I doubt it would fix my latest issue Changing the mantle is a already a hassle and with the igniter right next to it total pain in the ass I have yet to change the mantle without getting some tears The latest problem seems to be a fuel flow issue Dont know what the cause is I changed fuel bottles and changed the mantle but it did not do anything It burns like a candle now A blue flame that licks out of the globe Coleman used to be a solid brand When I moved on to more expensive gear I continued to use Coleman lanterns and stoves My next coleman lantern and stove not the time to go into that Ill probably find at a garage sale The quality vintage stuff Ive used it a couple of times now Except for the igniter it worked well The igniter seldom works But it works better than it did before I pushed it closer to the mantle with my thumb Coleman might consider just leaving it off The globe vents well so when you light it by hand there is no worrying about singing the hairs off your hand from a ball of flame The mantel must be completely intact Any tears will significantly impacts the light output Otherwise it is plenty bright doesnt use much fuel More importantly for me is how quiet it is even when turned all the way up If this had been just a lantern without an igniter I probably would have given it four stars After its performance on my last trip the first after my initial review I am dropping my rating from three to one star There seems to be an issue with the fuel flow that causes it to dim as if the tank was running dry which it wasnt I tried two other tanks thinking that might be the issue One of them was about three quarters full and the other brand new It started off fine but then it quickly dimmed again There was a small tear in the mantel so I replaced it thinking it might be the problem It wasnt Garbage 
Great idea I really like this product puts out plenty of light without filling up your pack or camper just right 
Good lantern bright 
Bought this for a 7 day backpacking trip in the Oregon Cascades You get what you buy and this Coleman insect head net is pretty nice I did not use it too much on the trip but the visibility is good even with it on I would suggest wearing a hat when wearing this because it is pretty large I ended up using as it a bag to hold stuff mostly I would buy again 
If you like to spend time outside and live where the bugs are a pain then this is the product you need Bought it for those times when we hike and the bugs are a pain Works great and the quality is good 
Great cooler kept all my drinks cold and my food fresh over a 3 day camping weekend Used 3 10lb bags of ice and worked perfectly 
All metal and solid craftmanship Heavy not for backpacking or hanging in a tent pocket 
Handy durable stakes the hammer and stake puller are wonderful and the hand broom and dust pan was passed around the family campsites it worked so well I just wish there were more stakes in the kit 
Great for additional securing of tent and tarp and efficient breakdown 
Good product Came in handy No complaints 
Good product but be careful with it This fell from the roof of my jeep when packing and a leg connector broke The collar that the legs connect to is a high stress point and should be metal or reinforced Other than that it does function well It should be staked in the ground to ensure stability too 
pros very handy to get light from above and not in your face its lightweight comes with a bag and can handle a pretty big lantern the materials used appears to be good quality cons i can not think of any i would recommend it to a friend i am thinking of getting a few more to lightup my camping area 
You are on a camping trip an you just lit your propane lantern The next question is where do you put it I bought a Coleman Lantern Stand which has a metal tripod base for stability and telescopes to seven feet and has a hook to hang the lantern on  I tried it out in on a winter camping trip It gets dark early and you need all the light you can get If you just put the lantern on a picnic table the light does shine far I set up the tripod and using the Coleman Northstar Lantern I was able to light up a bigger area Another advantage is that it does not take up space on your table and if you anchor the base with the included stakes it is secure have used the lantern chain to hang the lantern from which work great but sometimes there are no trees where you need them The Coleman Lantern Stand help you place the light where you need it 
i wish it came with a sparker self igniter 
GOOD 
Perfect Exactly what I wanted They work great too 
Its nice and small Easy to pack around Puts out enough light for a small cam The price is great for the product and its operational advantages over a larger lantern I just wish it had a built in igniter 
I wont buy it again I wanted a small lantern to light up my cooking area while attaching it to my three outlet tree on a five gallon tank It is not very bright at the highest setting It puts out a yellowish looking light which is not so bright for the cost My 20 watt bulb at home is brighter than this Its only good if you want a dim light around the campsite that is compact and lite to carry 
works well 
100GOOD 
I have had these stoves from Coleman for years and years They are compact simple to use and really durable its a great buy if you are planning an outdoors trip as you cant always rely on a fire 
Good backup for car camping cook system 
I mostly use this to boil water when Im campingI refill my small tanks I purchased one about 15 years ago that got swept away in a Gully Flood Bought this to replace it Looks the same Not the same Good idea but has the same poor quality construction I find in most things from Coleman in recent years The attitude of lets make it as cheap as possible found in most made in China equipment they produce leaves me unimpressed The internals of the valve mechanism are all plastic feel loose and do not give me a feeling of confidence when I turn the valve off As always when not in use the Tank and Stove must be separated Why not use a quality valve I would have paid an extra 1500  2500 for this product to get better quality I have simple propane soldering torches that screw to the top of the tanks with 10 times the quality for about the same money Coleman wants you to break the valve then throw away the unit and get another Sad that so many people here accept poorly engineered products these days and give 5 stars to everything they purchase Not a happy Camper I wont buy another UPDATE09222016 Found a much better quality product with similar design by MARTIN mfg in QuebecBought it 
This attachment is very effective at quickly heating It does the job well and is very easy to set up A couple things I think are worth noting and took it from a 5 star to 4 for me 1  It is huge The size of a small plate The upside is that it is very strong metal The downside is it is heavy 2  It seems hard to light but it may be for safety reasons Your matches must be in the exact right placement so if you are throwing them at it the way I was you have to land it right in the center If you have a long lighter or match no problem at all Lights easily with those 3  I wish they had found a way to combine the base and burner attachment for easy storage They almost fit into each other but not quite and instead they have to be stored separately and as per point 1 they take up a lot of room 
If you go anywhere outside camping hunting fishing etc You need to have this with you Light weight easy to use and 1 container will last up to a week Simply awesome 
Love this It has been a great addition to our camping home Love getting to make biscuits and muffins while camping Works great and is a good quality and stores away nicely I would recommend this product 
Great Productsuch a great product Who doesnt want to cook cinnamon buns while camping 
Works well We have used it in high altitude while camping Bakes great 
gift 
Great addition to all of our camping gear We use this all of the time Love this product and if you are looking for a great little camping oven this is the one 
Love the cooler  bought for the same price as a regular Coleman steel belted You can trust Coleman quality 
I have been wanting one of these coolers for years Reminds me of the quality built ice chests that my parents used when we used to go camping in the 60s This chest did not disappoint The only thing that could make it better is a bottle opener attached to the side like my Dads used to have 
This is a good quality net but it does not fit ideally around the face since it will stick to the face and neck depending on the size of your head and how it is worn I recomend wearing it over a hat to allow for a good enough separation between the net and the face For the price it is a good net It will aliveate insect pestering a great deal but this is not the best net available on the market 
as described 
Stakes work well in sand and the brushdustpan are essential I got these to replace the flimsy ones that originally came with the beach tent 
Great camping set We used all of the items on our camping trip and all items worked as expected 
Well designed It should come with two racks It takes a while to heat up and doesnt get very hot minus one star With the standard nonpowerhouse two burner coleman stove it seems to not quite fit if on one burner the burner doesnt center over the oven you cant use the other for anything Of over both burners most of the heat from the burners excapes because the stove is too small and the burners only are half underneath And the 14 sheet pans are too long to fit by one inch So overall minus one star because the size is awkward Maybe the Powerhouse stove would be a better match with this 
Very happy with this item Just as I expected 
Have not used this oven yet it is bult well 
Its been excellent Try it a couple times before you go to get the quirks of the thermometer Its not like a home oven where you can just forget it and have reasonably accurate cooking temps I tend to see it as reading about 100 degrees high Its probably reading accurately but since the heat is coming from the bottom it can be a lot hotter on the bottom of the pan or at the top where the heat accumulates than it is right where the thermometer is As well you cant just let it sit there and cook You have to check in on it Things like wind and outside temps and flame variability can really change things as you cook However Ive met some real artists who can turn out amazing dishes with these things and Ive had some real winning meals Imagine whipping out a hot steaming perfectlycooked lasagna at the camp site or finish the day with hot gooey freshly baked cookies 
Works awesome but is very loud VERY LOUD 
Excellent no problems 
OK I bought it and discovered two things First it works Second its kinda flimsey With the old 220 lantern series its steady but it flexes more than I would like The stake feature in the base really should be more horizontal so that some serious tent type stakes could be used The cheapo wire stakes that come with the unit are too weak to be of use The nylon case is OK its not going to last too long and putting the stand in it is a bit of a PITA Do not buy this with the idea that you will hang a Pertomax or Britelyte lamp on it Those are way too heavy to be safe All in all a servicable but not heavyduty Chicom made stand OK but not what Coleman used to make thats for sure 
Initially bought this for a Coleman lantern which has failed twice So I would like to congratulate Coleman on this product even if I cant for the lantern It collapses into a small enough package similar to a camp chair The bag is comes with is a bit thin and the feet have started to poke through but I drive on some pretty bad roads so the jostling in the back of the truck may have a hand in this The second use is as a flag pole I like the small flags made for boating These flags usually come with rivets so you can put the top one on the same piece which the lantern is hung from and use the flag clip or anything similar to connect to the upright pole Works great 
Good lantern stand also good for any type of light Easy to set up and put away includes bag Overall Im happy with this item 
For the money this is the answer if you are tired of finding a place to put your lantern that is close enough to where you are sitting yet not on the table blasting light in your eyes Mobile Light Adjustable in height Stable Perfect When I am eating I can bring one near me If I need more light When I am using my pop up privy to shower I can bring it over for more light if I need it The benefitsuses are endless I cannot imagine how this could collapse unless you have a defective unit OR you are too much of a wuss to twist the tubes and tighten them Honestly it only takes a couple of pounds of torque on mine and there is just no way its going to slip or collapseI tried to make it slipcollapse and honestly I could feel the legs flexing but the poles stayed at the height I had set them at In a strong breeze and soft soil I could see it tipping over Get longer stakes OR use a sandbag at the base and secure the center pole at the base to the sandbag with some twine para cord etc If you go the sandbag route you can ditch the stakes and just keep the empty sand bag and string in the case for the standthen you dont need a hammer or a rock to pound the stakes in the ground Wish it was a bit shorter when collapsed around 36 but other than that its just so dang handy Bought 2 considering another 
Does what its made for Great product arrived just in time for my next camping trip and served well in strong windy conditions I plan on buying one more soon 
Tried and true You might need to be somewhere with a wind block but it works as expected 
A bit big for my liking and the simmer control was pretty tough to nail down Ended up getting the Etekcity backpacking stove and it was a great complement to this one 
Its a great stove for car camping Very stable and easy to use 
True meaning of portability 
Nice cooler looks good but the lid does not lockdown very tight 
I wear this with a hat in mosquito country It works well and protects my face Eventually you hardly even notice its there 
Its light and fits just right over a hat and would be a wonderful product if the mesh was fine enough Unfortunately the mesh is rather course and will keep out mosquitoes and houseflies but is useless against black flies I grew to detest this product after having to use it for a few hours in black fly season 
So the brave UPS man rolls up the windy road to my house Im just digging in some rocky soil with noseeums dive bombing me all over my face and neck I immediately ran to him ripped open the box and put this on and then I signed for the delivery of my summertime bug abatement items In a manner of minutes I was ENJOYING THE OUTDOORS Amazing what a little face mask can do for yardwork productivity in the forest Provides adequate ventilation doesnt get stuffy or any kind of smell to it Also I like that I can put in on top of any hat and it also goes around the collar on my shirts to protect my neck skin Thanks mosquito head net makers 
I bought a variety of headnets from Amazon wishing to select the best one for my familys trip to the Amazon jungle Of all the headnets I bought  this one was the smallest It would not work with a hat with a brim all the way around didnt hang down to the neck area Even with a hat with a front brim only the net was so tight that it clung to my face Also  being green it didnt provide the visual clarity of another product that used black mesh 
This item works perfectly and keeps all the bugs away from my eyes ears and nose It also keeps grass from getting in my eyes or in my mouth and hair while mowing the yard I am very happy with this item and it worked exactly like I hoped You can not beat it for the price Very pleased makes working in the yard in South Georgia bearable Highly recommend for anyone who likes to work in the yard but cannot stand the gnats and mosquitos going for their eyes or ears Great quality and works perfectly Highly recommend 
Three stars for the poor mantel installation The top of my fuel stem has two sharp barbs on the ends which point up Installation of the mantel was difficult to avoid catching the netting on the barbs The mantel does not have a spring or tie strings which would allow you to enlarge the bottom hole I used needle nose pliers to stretch the hole wider so I could work the mantel past the barbs I installed two mantels the first was connected to the small grooves at the top and bottom of the fuel stem This produced very low light The second mantel was in a more marshmellow shape and will produce a much brighter light The light is not half of a double mantel lantern so dont expect that Everything else from other reviews is true packs small light weight top gets hot but the installation of the mantels is poor and that is why it only gets five stars 
I like it Does the job and put out more than enough light but has much more plastic The only thing plastic on my older lantern was the knob on the control valve It takes up much less space than a double mantle and uses half the gas The 51 mantles are not as popular as the ones used on the double mantle lanterns so stock up on them Always have several extra mantles on hand Overall I am pleased with it so far 
very high quality easy to get it going just make sure you dont touch it very hot use chain and give it cool down time before packing it upcoleman product what more do u have to say 
Compact and lightweight Nice amount of light for me Uses less fuel I dont need to light up the entire forest so why waste fuel This is all I need 
Works great Be sure to order extra mantles with this as they are hard to find When putting the mantle on I use latex gloves to prevent oil from your fingers from contaminating the mantle making sure the openings of the mantle are closer to each other and I dont preburn just open the valve a little and light Then open the valve to adjust brightness 
not bad 
Just what I have been looking for 
Happy 
works great but very loud Dont want to fill mattresses at night unless you want to disturb your fellow campers 
As long as you dont intend to remove the pegs They are strong and go in easily but getting them out is really hard The green ends rotate and are not at all substantial Pulling then out using the supplied tool simply bend the plastic end Useless 
I used this during my last camping trips The rubber mallet came off the handle on my second camping trip As any tools one needs to use with precaution but I really dont expect the mallet separated from the handle too soon I fixed it using Gorilla super glue and its good for now 
You get what you see 
Good quality and no complaints so far My family and I used this tent kit on our camping trips and I am glad that I purchased it 
This head cover works great but you need to use a hat with it for best performance I suppose any kind of hat will work but it seems to work best with a boonie hat The boonie hat keeps the net from rubbing up against your neck and face 
Used on a recent fishing trip and worked great kept the bugs out of my eyes and ears Really need to be used with a hat baseball cap was just fine 
This is a great head net because you can actually get away with not wearing one of those round hats Other nets absolutely need the hat 
These dont seem too bad except they hang right on the face but I dont think its something I cant work with 
This works great made muffins already and they turned out great I also love how it folds down very compact So why only 4 stars the thermostat is way way off it said it was about 200 degrees fahrenheit and my laser infrared thermometer said it was about 350 not sure if i can figure out how to adjust tstat otherwise I would have given it 5 stars 
We took ours on a cub scout campout and sat around all evening making muffins The scouts couldnt get enough We made biscuits the next morning and they were awesome This little thing works as well as an oven at home I may buy another just to have a spare in case we lose power this winter 
I was thinking to use it with a shower bag but when Ive added around 5lbs22Kg of weight the body gets unstable and the top part becomes bent In some situations the folding mechanism remained blocked Overall a good product with reserves for using it for other purposes 
This product does exactly what it is supposed to do and does it well Nothing else to say if you camp and use a lantern you need this product Just be careful when inserting the stakes or buy stronger stakes 
seen other stands that were barely 6 ft meaning that your lantern hangs at eye level this one gets it up above your head and throws more light used it on 3 day camp in NM did not need to stake down but recommend it 
Great little lantern it will run all night on one tank of gas 
Functional and easy to pack for lightweight camping We had an issue with one of them where a leak developed in the base and it melted the plastic 
Feels sturdy With the plastic base does not feel like it will tip over The most difficult thing about using it was removing the carbon monoxide warning tag Used it for camping with a small metal teapot and it heated the water up very quickly Highly recommend 
Very handy little stove for camping Is exactly as described and lasts a long time on a single propane tank Fast Shipping product arrived on time  undamaged and I overall recommend to anyone who is thinking of buying 
No propane bottle included Misleading 
nice 
This propane stove works great It lights easily after attached to a propane bottle with no leakage The wide burner and wide base make it sturdy even for some bigger pots It is a bit tall so shorter people working on a 36 table height might have some problem with it 
good price and deliver 
Works just fine I wish it was a bit more powerful so it could inflate the air mattress I bought it for quicker Overall it does what I need it to and I have had no issues with it 
Fills and deflates in a snap I use it along with the Coleman DoubleHigh Quickbed Queen and it will inflate it in about 67 min Deflates the same Good buy 
Coleman is the best brand cooler ever made Ive had one for over 20 years and use it exclusively when traveling simply because ice lasts for up to 4 days or more even in the heat of summer I purchased this one as a wedding gift because they love to go camping and this is by far the best cooler on the market today 
great 
Really nice addition for camping Folds flat for easy storage Easy to use and fairly easy to maintain temperature Gets to operating temperature quickly 
Great Deal as i need  But You have to keep an eye on the temperature though and adjust for any changes but thats the fun of camping right Dont waste your money on higher priced ovens 
Decent price for useful quality kit Supplemented the 4 included spikes with similar looking style spikes from Harbor Freight 3 for 6 
Very compact broomdustpan but the rest of it is super And its organized in a mesh bag which keeps everything together 
This kit is just a collection of a few items that can be useful when camping We used the mallet the broom in the tent and the stake puller most recently We didnt need the extra stakes but its always good to have extra All comes in a nice little mesh bag 
I like the tent kit I got it today 
worked great as an addition to our tent 
OK 
Nice small  compact propane lantern 
Was not as bright as I was hoping We do primative camping while hunting and use a large wall tent I was hoping it would be bright enough to light the enitre tent it was not Had to go to a two mantel lantern 
Doesnt put out the amount of light you would expect Less than half the light of a regular 2 mantle coleman propane lantern and uses almost the same amount of fuel Overall diappointing 
we bought one of those giant balls that are about 4 feet tall that children roll around the yard and it took hours to blow it up with this machine I thought with 120v it would do a lot better However for balloons and small items it may work great i think there should be a disclaimer about it being a quick pump and name items that it might not be too good at blowing up 
My husband and I purchased this to replace a battery operated version that wouldnt hold a charge after 2 years This is nice if you also buy the adapter to plug it in to your car outlet then youre set for home or camping 
This thing is great It goes up to 7 feet high which really lights the entire area Setup is a breeze because you just lower the tripod stand and tighten a single knob and youre done The only con to this entire item is the weight Dont even think about taking it on a campout that has much hiking involved Otherwise this is the perfect stand 
Nice and sturdy stand for a lantern It has holes in the 3 legs to put stakes in to be sure that it doesnt fall over 
Years ago I purchased a set of lantern stands similar to these actually they were less expensive but not coleman brand They were all aluminum tube construction even in the tripod legs unlike these They were rock solid and I wouldnt have had to replace them except that they got stowed in storage and were inaccessible and we needed new ones right away These more expensive ones have a rickety flat steel tripod leg construction on the same tube aluminum telescoping section I would recommend these to any other style of stand but for the money I wish they had built better value into them especially being coleman brand They almost got it right almost 
Burned everything I tried to bake in this There should be some sort of diffuser on the bottom since it burns the crap out of anything placed in it 
Have had Coleman Camp Oven for little over a week and more then satisfied with it I installed a duel burner non pressurized Origo Alcohol stovetop on my sailboat  the oven being the same size as a Coleman Camp Stove fits  works perfectly and cools down quickly so I can fold  pack out of the way Im more than happy with this product 
I love it   I layer ice  rock salt  then more ice on my beverages They nearly freeze in the bottle and stay that way for three days or so 
Wow this thing puts out heat It can boil water really quick Good to know I could put a nice sear on a steak if I have to take down a large animal while out in the woods 
Sturdy and very powerful I was so impressed with this on our recent camping trip I had large pots boil very quickly Im considering ordering another one 
We bought this for our air mattress and it definitely inflates it in a hurry But it is loud so keep that in mind when using it at night 
Nothing special does what it says Have used it a dozen times now and seems fine I use it when we car camp and its nice and compact 
Quickly filled air mattress Is somewhat loud but works so fast that it does not bother you much Works as described and will recommend to a friend 
kinda noisy but will do the job Its actually powerful and will blow your air mattress or whatever u r going to use  fast 
Tiny and gets really hot make sure you have a good hot mit but it does the trick Im vegan so camping dinners were difficult to plan for We decided to buy this to open up some more options We have done pizzas biscuits chicken nuggets croissants and muffins All came out great LIke I said  the entire oven gets really hot even the knob to open it up and get the food  so make sure you have a good oven mit and keep your kids away from it We purchased the OvenStuff NonStick 6Piece Toaster Oven Baking Pan Set to go with it  since the inside is quite small The pan set fits great 
Just the right size and adds to the menu of any outdoor cooking 
good 
Havent used yet but know with some added foil to keep in the heat better this thing will be great for camping Cant wait to make biscuits and muffins in this 
Worked great but make sure you have something heat resistant to set it on off of the stove 
Great camping oven or to use on stove when power outage occurs 
The Coleman Tent Kit is better than expected I have used everything in the kit and have had no problems 
Any time you can get the Steel Belted on sale do it Ive been through a number of the all plastic versions and they just dont hold up to normal abuse I have two steel belted coolers and both have taken far greater abuse and continue to get the job done I also find that the steel belted versions keep ice longer 
very happy with this coolerbought for my sons Christmas several years ago and he loves it 
oohh this is the one to buy we usually have this up and running while my friends fiddle with their stove I got this and the coleman propane light httpswwwamazoncomColemanDeluxePerfectFlowTMLanterndpB0009PUQFUrefsr1sc1ssportinggoodsieUTF8qid1468137426sr11spellkeywordspropranelight  and with a pair or propane tanks  we have every thing we need it comes with a stand  and just like the lamp  it takes about a minute to setup can take most of the camping type utensils no issues big pro  NO CLEAN UP  the other stove stink if you dont clean up before packup this is easy  just keep in a nice location and all the splatter will be around the stove  and non on it only con  you need a lighter to light this and the lamp I would recommend that you purchase with the lamp  and that is all you need along with a pair of colemen propate tank 
I have used this on 2 trips now and it works great Ive made spaghetti tacos coffee mac and cheese and hamburgers and everything turned out great Fuel adjustment stays where you put it and it has a spot to install a push button igniter as well Ill be adding that in near future just to add a little convenience It is a little clunky if youre packing for a hiking trip The valve tends to take up a good bit of space in my pack but thats just hiking For camping fantastic 
Was a gift 
Loved it Easy to use and light 
My mom was here when it arrived and was surprised to see it She said my grandfather used to use one many yrs ago I cant wait to try it this summer The reason for the 3 stars is because I havent used it yet 
loved it 
A good product AFTER you CUT  FIT two Pizza Stones on the bottom and middle rack to help it maintain a constant temperature 
at first it looked very flimsy but it works just fine 
Works great inflates a twin mattress in a jiffy Love the Coleman inflation nubs now that you can secure without losing any air from the mattress Pretty good thinking 
Bought this to replace a battery operated portable air pump that was not very effective This coleman pump is so much better Used it to air up 3 twin mattresses and it took about 20 seconds each Didnt give it 5 stars because Im not sure about long term reliability 
Does what it is designed for Small compact bright enough unit around the table or next to tent Wish it had a piezo or electric start but that would probably add to bulk and price 
I recommend this but there are some things to bear in mind  if you choose to hang this by the chain provided be sure the thing you hang it from can handle significant heat Id think twice about hanging it from anything other than metal I hung mine from a thick plastic PVC pipe and it melted the pipe in about 20 minutes  Take the lantern off the canister when you are not using it Im convinced it leaks gas even when it is set to off Once I left it on for a full day and the canister was nearly empty by the time I wanted to use it again at night despite the fact that it was set of off position 
needed one with built in starter 
It will be invaluable if the wind is blowing 
Everything you need if your tent comes with the half butt pics these pics are much better quality and you dont have to buy individual items for the small details that you encounter camping good little set 
ty great 
What a great cooler 
Quality Durable Kept my food cold over a five day camping trip in California with heat I was impressed how well the ice block ice held up considering the higher temperatures 90s I look forward to more use 
That is what this cooler is like because when you walk into a room or campsite and this cooler is there you just have to look at it Its sooooo darned sexy  OK so we have had ours about seven years or so We bought it when we were still tent camping and now we use it with our popup camper We could not be much happier with any cooler You need to make one improvement as soon as you buy this but its so inexpensive I still have to give this 5 stars Id give it 6 if I could Go to your nearest big box home improvement store and buy a small roll of white adhesive backed 14 X 14 foam gasket by Frost King or similar manufacturer Clean the groove in the lid with a solvent like Mineral spirits or similar Peel the backing off the gasket and stick the gasket into the groove in the lid working your way around to the back where you started Cut the gasket so its essentially one continuous seal leaving as small of a gap between start and finish as possible Now when you close the lid you will have a virtually air tight seal We go camping a week or sometimes eight days at a time Before we leave I go to the grocery store and buy 2 five lb pieces of block ice to put in the bottom If you have the freezer space you could make some block ice at home and save the 4 or 5 bucks After placing the block ice one either side of the bottom of the cooler I add our weeks worth of food bacon dogs burgers bacon milk butter bacon steak bacon you name it  Then on top of the food I add regular ice which I make at home though sometimes we buy it bagged at the store This cooler keeps ice 8 days or more this way no kidding  Im so completely impressed I have left the cooler closed after returning home and had some of the block ice still in it over 9 days Yes I also grew up camping with a 1960s original steel belted Coleman cooler and yes Ill admit the quality of the vintage coolers was better Thicker steel better latch screw on Oringed drain cap and built in bottle opener Believe me I will get that ole Coleman from my big brother one day  It will be mine oh yes it will be mine  But the reality is the new steel belted coolers are what we can go out and buy today and this one is great Get it in stainless steel and it will be guaranteed never to shrink stink wrinkle or rust  
good stuff 
This oven is awesome Not only does it fold down to about an inch in height and fit back in the cardboard sleeve it came in but it folds out and locks into place with minimal required dexterity has a chrome grill that is adjustable for 3 heights a stay cool handle to open or latch it a carry handle not sure how cool that handle stays under baking conditions so FYI a temp gauge that goes up to 600 degrees or was it 650 degrees Sits on your camp stove burner so depending on your burner BTU output should bake real good I have not yet tested it for degree accuracy but I would think just turn on your burner to medium or low and watch as it approaches your baking temp if it goes beyond it turn burner down until you find your baking temp load your baking goods and bake Quality Coleman product even though I think it is made in China 
Just what I needed 
I ahve been using it since before christmas and it works fine I am camping with it 
I hope to never have to use this item I purchased this for my emergencydisaster relief kit for earthquake preparedness here in California 
very good 
Great product 
I have owned and used Coleman lanterns for as long as I can remember I have always used the old two mantle lanterns before now Unfortunately my last one finally got too beat up to use When I was looking around on what to replace it with I came across this one mantle unit I was drawn to it because of the compact nature of it and the ability to store it in smaller spaces My only concern was that it was not going to put off enough light with one mantle That concern was quickly put to rest after lighting the unit up the first time The lantern arrived well packaged and the instructions were easy to follow Installing the mantle burning it and placing the globe on all went quickly and easily The mantle does seem like it is fairly safe inside the unit so I am not really all that concerned that it will get damaged while in storage but I did do as other reviewers requested and ordered extras through Amazon I have checked in stores since doing so and the others are correct they are no where to be found in the local stores I highly recommend this lantern and I look forward to using it for many years 
Ive had a double mantle and took my chance on the single mantle Its PERFECT for a family outing The nice thing that I use this one for is mounted on top of my propane tree Its an excellent light with good quality materials Pros Coleman quality Heavy gauge materials that look like they are going to be durable for years Easy to change mantle Compact storage Protective cage around glass globe Cons Little difficult to light but with a sparker or a butane match its actually moderately easy No durable storage case available This little lantern is almost perfect if you are space conscious cars and SUVs are only getting smaller but still want a fully funtional propane lantern One thing I did notice about this lantern is that you can carry the lantern lit with the chain you can feel warmth from the lantern but not heat The only thing that would make this lantern better is if it had an autolite feature where when you turn the gas on a little pizo ignighter sparks the thing to life 
Small compact and great to throw in the pack Ive used these for years coleman discontinued them a while back the kids kind of made off with the two i had so i got a new one 
Its not as bright as I had expected but that could jus be me Used it with my 7 year old on a scout trip One mantle easy to use easy to set up easy to carry I keep it wrapped in a small towel in the back pack to cushion the glass 
Coleman always seems to make good quality items seem to work good and stores away easily for a power outage 
The size of this lantern makes it easy to store move and carry It gives off decent heat too I wish the glass was more durable but there are replcement globes out there Works great when paired with a stand for propane tank 
We use the extra stakes for our camping tarp The tent kit bag is see through and durable The hammer is strong and does not break down from use on metalonly stakes 
The mallet is made from some toxic chemical and the smell does NOT go away Ive had it sitting outside for two weeks If you put it in your house youd smell it immediately across the room I have had this problem with other cheap plastic products from China You can wash it air it etc but the toxic odor will not go away AVOID THIS PRODUCT 
This kit works nice for my tarp under a 10x20 canopy The stakes work great for holding things down but the hook is useless for getting them up The dust pan and broom work okay for small areas but not as large as what I have I used the kit in my tent and it seems to work just fine The hook is still useless 
Great addition to a camping set Glad to have it when camping 
Very Pleased 
bought with a full coleman blowup bed inflates in under 5 minutes LOUD but its not on very long so if that makes it inexpensive its a great tradeoff 
THIS PRODUCT FUNCTIONS VERY WELL AND AT A REASONABLE COST I WOULD DEFINITELY PURCHASE THIS ITEM IN THE FUTURE IF I HAD A NEED I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT 
Great pump Quickly inflates the air mattress Im not sure why others are not aware that when you move air quickly to inflate something the displacement of air will cause significant noise This pump is not quiet by any means and Im not sure of any compact sized pump that is 
Payed itself in batteries on the first two weekends Great pump inflates very quickly and deflates your inflatables very quickly 
I havent used this yet It is of good quality and should be easy to use 
This was a gift for my boyfriend So far he is more than happy with the cooler 
Amazing durability solid looks and good performance Slightly pricy for a cooler but these will last a really long time Friggin bomb proof 
I like it It works fine 
Great for camping not for backpacking This is a great setup for a casual campsite and if you have the room to spare You will need to pack a flame source as well which is why this is getting 45 stars 
Excellent for camp use It is a little tall once set up so I recommend that you have it on a smooth level surface It is large enough to use for a group backpacking activity though you may have to distribute the propane top and bottom between different packs 
I like this stove with the wind shield and heat adjustments About 3 to 4 minutes and you will have boiling water 10000 btu makes camping a lot easier Thus far I have cooked 4 spaghetti meals from one tank of fuel and the tank still has fuel left I use the dump method of cooking the spaghetti Draining the water then dump the canned spaghetti sauce on top and cook until heated I average about 10 minutes per meal cook time adjusting from high to low flame setting I have found that if you use a 6 inch long piezo lighter it works better than the short piezo lighters 
Worked great on my camping trip Setup wasnt hard perhaps it would have been nicer if the burner was a little more accommodating shape but its not worth hassling over as I was able to fit my camping pot on top of it with minimal difficulty The base fit the coleman propane tank perfectly but I doubt it would fit competitors but thats a non issue as every store with camping goods that Ive been to carries coleman portable propane tanks 
Good flame 
Very cool actually very hot I bought this oven not knowing if it would work on my small Coleman FoldnGo singleburner camp stove Though its designed for the larger twoburner Coleman stoves it works just fine on my little one I successfully baked cinnamon rolls and cooked a cauliflower casserole without difficulty The highest temperature I could get with the small stove is 300 degrees F but that was good enough to cook these items I like the way it folds almost flat and it sets up easily This is a nice product that works well 
I bought this from a different store because Amazon didnt have it available when I wanted The primary use is for a boat but I started test driving at home on top of the largest stove burner gas stove Because of its shape I found it a bit harder to center on top of the flame so I bought a grill grate Weber 7431 Cooking Grate to be on the base This little gem works incredibly well and I couldnt be more pleased So far I baked bruschettas pizza and potatoes wedges and everything was perfectly cooked toasted and tasty I will run a few more tests on my kitchen so I know what expect out of it when cooking on the boat Highly recommend this product 
We do a lot of camping and lately road trips  with camping We used to take the big and bulky Coleman lanterns double mantle as we thought the more light the better Its been years taking that Products have changed and so have we I have tried other lights like some of the many LED or fluorescent lanterns big and small Most or actually all of them collect dust in the basement Never have liked the quality of light from the LED nor the archaic by now fluorescent LEDs have become better but not so much the color characteristic of the light  too whitishblue So I returned to a favorite light we used more than 20 years ago the MightyLite I think it was called Basically it was the same as this light but with the advantage of the ignition piezo I like it because it is compact easily packed in its box and into the camping box It certainly doesnt compete in sheer light output like the big ones and doesnt hiss aloud but one doesnt have to shield their eyes either I think the quality is nice not a cheap lookingfeeling product The ignition works fine We either hang it over the camping table or on it or anywhere one wants to put it Mantels are hard to find in local sporting goods stores even REIs flagship store here in Seattle Save yourself looking for them  buy them online and buy 4 or more to keep in the box as mantles can be damaged easily with too much bouncing knocking around The glass globe is well protected by the cage 
The advantage of this lantern is that is quite small so easy to carry in a camping setting Quality is good but it is difficult to find the type of mantle that this unit uses so keep a backup if you decide to buy this unit Shortly after I received this lantern I found a two mantle Coleman with hard carry case for about 10 more which I subsequently purchased Live and learn I hope this information is of help to those considering the purchase of this lantern 
This is just what I was looking for Small and light weight but puts off a good amount of light Used it at the deer lease last weekend and it was perfect Not too bright but enough light to cook and read by 
I just wanted a light that was simple and worked well and now I have one I will tell all my camping friends 
does the job ok price a this is great b this is awe some c this is quality d this is out standing e this is 
does the job it is intended to do 
I bought this to keep with my Coleman Instant Cabin and I use it every time The tent stakes are better than what came with the tent and the broom and dust pan and easy for cleaning out the tent 
nice 
Great product 
Great look and durability 
Well worth the price I beat the bageebers out of at least two cheaper plastic coolers on my drift boat and finally stepped up to this steel box that easily supports the forward passenger seat It should hold up more than twice as long as the two combined It is sturdy durable land does the job for me 
Bought this thinking it would be a substantial cooler Light weight and not impressed overall Wish I could return it but Ive used it Lock doesnt stay secure Not worth 100 
Very nice cooler 
very good pump it did what it supposed to do and it was easy to set up took me only 15 mins to figure it out 
Works Great  Heats up a coffee pot in no time Would be nice if it had a built in sparking device hing hint Coleman 
Works as I expected No problems with this item 
I used this for a cross country tripvan life Small and portable cooking solution 
Works very well Taller than I thought it would be once connected to the fuel tank And igniting it can be a bit tricky but it performs as advertised 
Good if you can not get a fire going 
I own more than several other coleman lanterns and am satisfied with all of them and I understood this being a single mantle lantern it would put out reduced amounts of light I was a bit underwhelmed when I fired it up I would say it puts out just enough light tp be useful when fishing or camping and thats it I also picked up a coleman micro lantern at the same time that runs off the butanepropane mix canisters and it blows this away with much brighter and whiter light mostly due to the fuel being burned as they use the same 51 mantles Consider this a personal light source for fishingcamping at its best 
It is compact and easy to light It does throw a ton of light The down side is I can not find backup mantels for a reasonable price I have not yet found a local store that carries the replacement mantels 
I looked at duel mantle lanterns just because they put out so much light After buying the single mantle I realize the single meets my needs I am not trying to light up a pasture at night just see well while camping Very satisfied 
Great lantern for any use Patios camping or when the lights go out I use it when Im sitting on my porch late at night 
I love this little lantern This thing will run for hours on one canister of fuel The light output is infinitely adjustable which extends the fuel consumption ievery low burning nite light in the deep dark out of doors Pouring rain or freezing cold dead of winter this lantern will light instantly The chain is handy for hanging anywhere ietwist a small green limb from a tree thru it and it will stay for days no need for stringsropes or wire Buy a cheap padded camera case and zip it around the globe for instant protection during transport The little camera case I use has a pocket I use for stashing spare 51 mantles 
Puts off plenty of light for a single tent 5 person camp Fairly quite and nice and small I am very very pleased with this and it gives off just enough light that a double mantle is unnecessary 
keeps items cold up to 4 days inside conditions havent tried it in the heat looks great and drains well with side plug only down fall is the locking latch only hold 10 lbs pressure but i think its less than that 
This is pretty much a novelty It does not hold ice and it leaks around the drain Wouldnt buy another even if it was half price 
Terrific product lives up to the Coleman name 
It may not be necessary to spend this much money for a cooler yet there is a beauty in having this one in your back seat doing a great job with a lock to keep the lid on 
Definitely recommended Was worried that in would be a typical china garbage product but it has worked well and blew up a queen size air mattress many many times without incident Buy it 
Works pretty well but needs to be level and watched which could be a problem if you are baking something that takes a long time And it must be used where kids cant bump it or get burned by it Definitely has to used outside or you could burn the building down I baked cornbread and a casserole in this and they turnedout fine once we got the temperature regulated A good deal if you really want an oven Just be careful using it 

Great little oven 
Really nice and i was so surprised how well it worked I would have given it 5 stars but unfortunately it did not meet my expectations due how ineffective it was in the wind so if you routinely camp in windy conditions and have the room for a larger stand alone combination propane oven then get that one This one is easy to use and set up and as a bonus it easily packs flat I would suggest not using metal pans in this because items tend to burn at the edges Ive used pyrex glass and get great results without any charring 
Good Product 
great 
Works good and what was expected 
I havent used it yet but it sets up great Going to use camping or for emergencies 
This works great and I use it on my skottle Temp control in great 
Ive had this out in my trailer for six months using it for both a work light and for general illumination It works great and hasnt been bothered by the odd knock The lamp is quite bright a bit bright for a table lamp but its easy enough to diffuse the light Still on the original set of batteries A very good performer and a very very good value Compare this to a GE lantern that was given to me a few months ago that is now dead The GE is not serviceable and is basically throw away junk The Coleman product has a much better design and can actually be serviced and replacement lamps are widely available I wouldnt waste my money on a nonColeman lantern for the serviceability issue 
I bought this lantern for a camping trip and it worked pretty well Pros  The 8 Dcell batteries gives it a good weight so it wont slide around  The light is very nice and bright and it doesnt get very hot  The battery life is pretty good We used it every night for a week and it still seemed to be going strong  Once the battery compartment is screwed tight the lantern feels pretty solid Cons  It takes 8 Dcell batteries which is a bit pricey  The batteries are held in a removable battery holder which is then inserted into the lantern and held in place with a Velcro strap The setup feels a bit flimsy  The two brightness settings are almost indistinguishable We just kept it on the lower setting to hopefully lessen the drain on the batteries Overall this lantern is a good buy It survived our week long camping trip without giving us any issues The build quality is good enough once you close up the battery compartment Just dont be too rough when youre changing the batteries 
It works fine and I was able to cook a deep dish pizza Due to the size there isnt much room for convection to occur To avoid burned spots it is sometimes necessary to move or rotate my food 
best camp oven 
Like others mentioned in their reviews yes this pump is very loud But it inflates and deflates the Coleman air mattress quick in a few minutes it is done 
Only problem is that the nozzle attatchment doesnt quite stay on long enough for bigger jobsstill very good air flow and price 
This pump is very powerful and fast It blew up an twin size air mattress in about 1 minute is a bit loud but you have to expect that from a pump like this and is not going to make you go deaf 
The lock does not work but even with that major flaw it still keeps ice all weekend in 100 degree temps Gotta keep it in the shade though 
convenient to own 
Perfect 
Great buy for campers 
I was a little disappointed with the light output even when I used two of the lanterns but the lantern does pack small Ill be going back to my Coleman two mantle because I can adjust the light up to a much more useful brightness when I need it and then I can turn it down to save on propane 
it works as advertised but Id like a well fitting plastic case for it I get tired of pulling out Coleman Boxes when we car camp and having to worry about them getting wet These types of lanterns are just a bit fragile but they work 
I have owned several types of lanterns over the years There are pros and cons between gas and propane styles The gas ones work longer but the propane ones are very convenient This little lantern is great for the weekend camper that doesnt set up a large camp It projects a good amount of light and is very portable It is well constructed 
This is a very compact lantern Not huge like other ones It would be great for car camping or backwoods camping if you are willing to carry the propane canister Installation of the mantle was easy and as others have said its mantel 51 Mine does not have an piza ignitor so I have to light it manually 
I bought this for emergency use or camping Name brand product well made good price shipped right away I recommend this product 
I love this little guy It really lights up an area not as much as a 2 mantle obviously without spending nearly as much fuel According to the box you can get up to 12 hours of run time on a single cylinder Thats plenty for a two or three day trip Be careful if you get one because it has a real glass globe so pack it well in your ruck It would be fine for car camping for sure It also comes with a handy chain to hang it from so you dont need to carry the wide base for the cylinder All in all I love it and my only wish is that I would have asked for the model with the piezo electric striker so I wouldnt have to use matches or a lighter 
This inflator works well is relatively quiet and you dont have to worry about charging the batteries which would be dead every time you wanted to use it  my previous inflator was of the battery persuasion Of course the amount of noise it make is neither here nor there  you will be awake when you use it  it might scare the cat or the dog but not you or the kids Made In China makes me expect a short life but we do no longer have a choice do we 
Great price and works well It blows up my queen air mattress in less than 5 minutes and deflates it as well It has 2 adapters attached that work well for the mattress too So far thats all Ive tried but I know the pointy attachment would also work for floats and things 
This was a gift for my hubbie I had to hide it for a month It was SO hard but so worth it to see the SMILE on his face He says he is gonna keep it till he dies 
I love it my wife hates it because she needs to balance a large pan on it So I bought the type like a hot plate 
Works great no problems with the actual item Keep in mind if you are looking for something more compact then you may want to get a backpacking stove Great little stove but a bit big for what I wanted for motorcycle camping 
One of the few camp style burners I have ever used where the settings are actually EASY for setting from low med and high output ranges Most others are way too sensitive or Creep up on you once you have your flame 
I probably shouldnt leave a review yet because Im just heading out in my van for an extended tripwhich was the reason that I bought this I love the fact that it folds down and it can tuck it away until I need it Reflects Colemans long time high standard of qualitysurprisingly heavy but easy to handle I love the concept designkeep life simple 
Shipped fast Well packaged Exactly as pictured Well made 
I was shocked seeing the oven folded in the box I just received this oven yesterday so Ill test it this weekend 
Works well if you play around with the heat levels Works best with two burner Coleman stove dont worry about temp you will find that cooking temp on unit is kind of useless If you need 350F you will find the temp on the oven at 250F will be perfect My only complaint is the door latch is kind of bad design 
corn bread muffins and pie so far even though its nearly 100 degrees here Great addition to my outdoor kitchen 
Good deal for my small trailer with only a cook top 
This is a handy kit I gave a 3 star because one of the stake tabs broke when being removed from the ground They are plastic The net bag isnt as convenient as I had hoped but overall a pretty good kit 
heavy duty posts held our tarps down during a rain and wind storm very well brush and pan work great for keeping tent clean 
I like the rubber mallet but not sure what to think of the tent spikes For my tent a 4 person seemed a little excessive The broom seemed do an ok job To finish clean up I got the vacuum So that is why it is a 4 do to the broom I think however the spikes will do better for a bigger tent 
Perfect for me I could not set up my tent without it 
I purchased this to use with the Century TwoPiece 1830 Type 1 Safety Post The nipple at the bottom of the Lantern is shorter than the nipple on the post preventing it from depressing the post valve correctly  no gas to the lantern and failure to light I do have a knack of fixing things so I place a small washer under the nipple shoulder and was able to lift it enough so it would make proper contact with the tree Yes it works but not the way it should works with the little coleman tank just fine 
It would take a few tries to ignite the lantern You have to open the valve for a few seconds before you turn further to strike for the spark Sometimes I waited for too long and it will create a huge poop sound when lighting it up I would just use a match lighter to light it up instead Other than that it works fine a can of propane could last a few hours 
This thing is super bright and runs for hours I just wish there was a clear replacement for the little bag inside It probably requires a call to Coleman to figure out which ones to buy 
Screws on by hand comes with cheapy Mantle  The replacement Mantles are much heavier duty  enclosed mantle shrinks aganist the gas tube makes kind of a arc light new mantle shrinks to a cotton ball size and a better light 
Perfect lamp for camping or power out situations The flow valve allows you to pick how much light A the lowest setting it is quiet but still provides a ton of light almost too much At the highest setting light output would be excessive for indoors except in a very large room The downside of all propane lanterns is harsh light when burning it produces a very bright light akin to a welding torch which is fine but can be difficult to use close to lamp If you hang it above you on the handy chain it is almost perfect for lighting a campsite for 1015 feet around 
This pump works well but I wished it included some type of carrying bag I guess that would increase the price though 
great cooler 
Great Product It is the official Dad cooler just like the one my father had during my childhood but dont buy it just for the nastalgia this cooler works great Once you prime it your drinks and food will remain cold for days with the same bags of ice During a 7day trip I filled the cooler initially with 3 x 10lb bags will hold 4 bags and only had to slightly draintop off with ice twice every 3 days The basecore ice never completely melted which ensured all items maintained a constantstable temperature 
Ability to maintain block ice is good Ability to maintain cubed ice is fair Retro look is perfect 
Cant wait to try it looks well made With this and a smaller family or for yourself you dont really NEED one of those big heavy coleman stove set ups 
Other than it taking 5 days when I used two day shipping this product is exactly what I was wanting It is sturdy for cooking with pots and pans Only down side is if your packing this in on a hike is that its a little heavy and bulky 
I purchased this lantern for my elderly mother to use as an emergency light in power outages Not the cheapest available but I knew Mom would get a kick out of the oldstyle looking Coleman in a modern battery version That was 8 years ago The lantern has probably seen a maximum of 12 hours of use if that It functioned beautifully until the batteries leaked I know that is not the fault of Coleman but I would guess it is not a terribly atypical problem They were Duracell but still batteries will leak over time I cleaned up the leaked batteries and found one of the terminals to be badly corroded I cleaned up the terminals still the circuit could not be completed I decided that the part needed to be replaced so went to the Coleman site There are replacement parts for this lantern but not the battery holder which is a little plastic housing with terminals you put the batteries in it and slide the whole thing into the base of the lantern I called CS and was helped by a very nice man but all he could tell me is that the part is discontinued and not available This renders the other barely used and fully functional parts useless So here we have a lantern still on the market and a critical part one that may be easily damaged by faulty batteries is discontinued I have white gas Coleman lanterns from 1950 that are still fully functional How wasteful and shortsighted of Coleman to not continue to provide critical replacement parts for a lantern still on the market today I will be replacing this lantern with an LED model from another company I simply cannot support a company that supports this kind of builtin obsolescence Our landfill does not need this kind of needless waste Simply irresponsible behavior by a company that makes its money off of people who love the outdoors Sickening 
JUNK Bought this just over 1 year ago Stored it in a cool dry place Used it once for one power outage for about 3 hours and put it back without the batteries installed Took it out to get ready for a big storm put it new batteries and WALA nothing No night light no low power no high power Just the click click click Now Im reading there is a faulty switch on Coleman lanterns Dont bother thinking of sending it to the Service Center in Kansas It will cost you more to send it there for fixing then it would just to go out and buy another lantern this time not a Coleman UPDATE The 1 light bulb that is sold for this lantern will set you back 2000 over half the cost of this lantern 
Great for cookies while glamping 
Wasnt real sure what to expect from this little oven but it has been a big hit on our camping trips Does a very good job 
This little oven is the greatest I baked Fresh blueberry muffins In it while camping They came out great Negatives did not get hotter than 275 degrees  disappointing  however muffins did eventually come out golden and yummy Took a while on high heat  used a bit of fuel but they worth it We will experiment with Hotter fuel source We used Coleman stove with 7500 BTU burner but oven did not fit well on burner  I will try a butane stove next time and am also investigating biomass stove to experiment with Will update to see if little oven can achieve 5 stars 
I had been without one of these for several years and didnt realize how much I missed it 
First time out I decided to see just how hot I could get the temperature in this oven Let me tell you it got so hot using it on a small Coleman stove that is melted the griddle grate underneath the oven Weve since now use it without the barbecue cooking grate in place 
This 29 item turned my trusty Coleman stove into a reasonable oven I made biscuits and scones twice with the oven The first time I burnt the bottom of the scones The next time I watched the temperature on the door and adjusted my stove burners early enough to get the temp right at 350 F Perfection biscuitry I think this is a great addition for those that camp often enough to use it a few times a year It is sturdy folds up easily You can only use a small baking pan inside but there are a few ones avaliable at your local big box store I love it Buying the camp chef oven soon though so this will be a back up 
I used to dread blowing up air mattresses and pool floats but not anymore This little pump works like magic My air mattress fills up in seconds I would recommend this unit to anyone who needs an electric pump 
This quick pump is not very useful and not of the best quality The worst part is the adapters  tips included It includes two adapters  one for typical pinch valves and the other for larger valves typically found on blowup mattresses I found that the tip for use on the pinch valves is still too big It barely would fit in those types of valves and required a lot of effort There are some pinch valves it simply will not fit in After using it on ten different valves the tip broke off Now the item is useless Poor design and poor quality Avoid 
Work as described 
Just the kit I needed for my new tent Few stakes puller hammer and dust pan with broom I added another 10 steel stakes to the kit no problem A must have for serious campers 
Has everything you need Stakes included in it are better than my tents stakes 
Mallet and stakes seem very sturdy and robust Im not sure if the brush and pan will be much use as they are pretty small Im also not sure how folks reported they bent the stake puller as I tried to mess it up and couldnt Basically the whole kit is a little cheaper than just buying four stakes and a mallet so it is a pretty good bargain 
Unlike my 2mantle lantern this little lamp can be turned down very low and the control even has detents so that you can tell which setting youre selecting On full brightness its about half as bright as a 2mantle lantern  which is quite adequate for many purposes But its gas consumption is also half that of a 2mantle lantern so you can really stretch the fuel when you turn the light down low According to the label a tank lasts 12 hours at full output or 18 at reduced output I was without power for 10 days after Hurricane Sandy when there were no gas bottles to be found anywhere I only had a few so I was very happy to have this little gas miser I had no problem installing the mantle but like another reviewer I reduced the rating one star for workmanship The lamp does not sit quite straight on the gas bottle and the globe is not centered within the wire guard An additional concern is that this lantern hangs from a rather short chain rather than a hardened wire hoop like the larger lanterns I reduced the rating an additional star because the chain gets so hot that you cant touch it without receiving a severe burn Moreover anything it hangs from might be singed or ignited so youll need to operate it in a support ring on a flat surface While I appreciate the effort to make this lantern as portable as possible the conventional wire hoop is an indispensable safety feature 
We really like our little light We replaced a 2 mantle lantern with this one This thing doenst put out nearly the amount of light that our 2 burner did but its still plenty It takes up WAY less room in our camping tote which is a good thing for us since we camp in a Jeep and have to keep things small The mantle was pretty easy to put on I just made sure to do it at the house before we left The mantles are hard to come by I havent seen them anywhere Im glad we ordered some ahead of time I was kind of worried that the carrying chain would get hot but it didnt I took off one star because its just not as bright as the bigger lights We may buy another one to have on either side of the camp It uses very little fuel over a period of time Good light 
This is a nice lantern I agree with other reviewers that the threads could have been made stronger but then it is an inexpensive unit Evidently to keep the weight down and for corrosion resistance the base is made of a zinc alloy That is all good but a castin steel thread or a helicoil could have been employed in the design The instructions were very sketchy It says to install the mantle Uhh this is my first lantern my first mantle By the way what is a mantle Anyway I just slipped it over the post and hoped for the best There were no strings to tie And the product description says that to light you must use matches a lighter However the unit I got has a piezoelectric starter which so far works nicely And of course since I did not know how to install the mantle I thought the electrodes for the starter which were not supposed to exist might have been a place to tieoff the strings that appear on the photos but did not exist on the product It was hard to get the mantle to light the first time and I even blew the lid off That was scary but cool But subsequently the starter works very nicely I ordered a lighter for it but I wont be using it The lantern is small and light weight It will only get intermittent use from me so it may last a long time Dont look at the flame for very long Youll be seeing the sun for quite a while Addendum In case you are wondering which replacement mantles to get these are the originalsnbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefColemanCompany2Pk51LantMantle51A104LanternAccessoriesdpB000PB7JBMrefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTF8Coleman Company 2Pk 51 Lant Mantle 51A104 Lantern Accessoriesanbsp no strings to tieoff 
Havent had it out in the woods yet But it puts out alot of lightBeing smaller than its 2burner cousins it should last quite a bit longer Make sure u get a couple of the replacement 51 mantles as not everyone has them I will buy another shortly 
The day after I received this lantern we had a 20 hour power outage My wife said I caused it but I told her I was just planning ahead LOL I find the lantern puts out plenty of light for our purposes I like that it can be turned down to save gas and the decrease in light doesnt make that much difference The lantern has much more light than a kerosene lantern and its nice we dont have to put up with that kerosene smell I cant comment on fuel usage as we only ran it for about 3 hours yesterday evening Im going to order one more for us and one for those at the family ranch If they want more they can buy their own LOL 4412 Used the lantern while in my travel trailer over Spring Break Got about 20 hours give or take from the first bottle 
parents love it have done m eat loaf and all kinds of stuff in it biscuits for gravy would recommend to anyone needing an oven for camping or emergency 
I love ours Its easy to pack away fits perfectly on our 3 burner stove with room for a cast iron skillet This is a worthwhile addition to anyones camp gear Make biscuits cakes muffins heck even pizzas for the kids with this thing We made some amazing biscuits to go with our Mountain Man breakfast the last time we went camping Nothing like hot buttered biscuits out in the woods 
First time we used it was a cool morning Was not sure how it would perform It suprised us both baked cinnamon rolls in the mountains Set temperature at 225 on gauge put in rolls 20 minutes later we had rolls We keep it in the box because it keeps together very well for travel and storage Very satisfied 
I took this on a 2 day camping trip and I still had solid ice in it on the drive back I have to agree with some reviews that the handles are latch feel a lot more flimsy than my parents old mintcoloured coleman icechest and I miss the beer openers on the handles too Fix this and Id give it 5star Tip put water in a 9x13 cake pan and freeze it I used about 4 of those as ice blocks and they fit perfectly in the bottom and along the sides 
Great cooler keeps things refrigerator cold for many many hours 
works great theres nothing like a brand new stove 
Use this for car camping Heats great and quickly 
My husband takes this to work every day to heat or fry his lunch 
This is a super and simple design You basically dont need much space to use this The 1st time we used outdoors was when we went to a National Park The kid was hungry when we were coming back and we had to really use it for 10 mts to heat things and make up something and it did its job despite us not having the best of space It doesnt need much space and the base is sturdy enough to hold a solid pan or a vessel to heat I am glad I bought this 
This is a barebones propane burner nothing exceptional especially when there are cheaper products that do the same thing Also bulky and heavy but solid as a result 
This is great for car camping and even wilderness canoe trips Use the base for stability Burns very evenly 
Works great and inexpensive 
While this lantern works there are a few drawbacks 1 The light it puts out isnt that bright 2 It is not very steady sitting on the propane cylinder It is easy to knock over and break the top 3 It hisses a lot burning the gas to create light And if you turn it up to be somewhat bright it REALLY makes a lot of noise There are good battery powered alternatives which have none of these drawbacks and are similarly priced or less Because of that I cannot recommend this product 
Attaching the mantle is not an easy job The holes in the mantle are small and are closed with thread You have to spread the mantle open slip it on and then it gets caught up in the hardware I had to use a small pair of pliers to pull the mantle down over the burner rod For me it was a pain in butt My model is not the pizio ignition model yet the wires for it are under the globe and are another obstacle for the mantle installation Nimble fingers would be helpful 
I bought this lantern in the summer of 2002 We use it for probably a total of about 16 days a year Im still on my first mantle 8 years later We tent camp and trailer camp so it doesnt get jerked around a lot It puts out as much light as well ever need for the type of camping we do It stores small is easy to carry around with the chain and is easy to light I find propane and fuel lanterns can be rather obnoxious so I keep it hanging from a tree with a lantern hanger about 15 feet away and not turned up all the way If we need light to read by or play games by we use a Candalier  3 candle lantern with the 9 hour candles which also comes in very handy during power outages If this lantern were to somehow break beyond repair I would get another one without hesitation 
Overall this lamp is awesome For a signlemantle unit it really kicks out the light when you need it It also runs for hours on end as long as you are prudent with your settings Why use fullbright when you can turn it to midrange and let your natural nightvision make up the rest We used one tank of fuel over 5 nights of camping and I am certain that we had it on for at least 4 hours each night Fuel options for this unit arent so great You are stuck using the standard green Coleman 1lb cannister which is very bulky compared to other fuel containers of similar capacity The fuel tank is bigger than the lantern So far I have not been able to find any compatible propane tank of a smaller capacity that would fit this For a 2night trip a 12lb tank would be great but only if it were half the container size of the 1lb tank You can get away with using this lantern for backpacking as along as you have someone who is willing to carry the fuel tank If you are packing it solo forget about it Buy a candle or use a headlamp for your trip Again it is not a weight issue with the fuel tank just the size 
good kit 
We used everything glad we had it 
Handy to have when camping 
Need more heavy duty stakes 
Perfect standard tent kit Has everything youd ever need 
Works great and has the necessary attachments Inflates and deflates with ease Just remember that this is a 110vac unit with no battery option 
I chose an AC pump rather than deal with batteries This pump works fast in inflate as well as deflate mode Its very each to attach to the mattress and to use 
I purchased this product solely to use as a pool toy inflator as advertised on the Coleman Web Site which says Quickly inflate or deflate virtually any airbed or inflatable I realize this is meant primarily to be used for inflatable beds but it does come with an adapter the pointy one with the loop on the end that is supposed to be used for other inflatables I have an attachment that attaches to our shop vac that is supposed to be used for inflating pool toys but it is bulky and difficult to use Unfortunately the adapter on this Coleman Pump isnt any better and does not easily fit into any pool toys that I have and I have many different sizes and shapes It barely fit into the largest ones that I had and when it did it didnt do a very good job of inflating the pool toy at all It was slow weak and extremely loud The nozzle and loop is supposed to be used to open the stop valve in the pool toy but the nozzle was so big it wouldnt get in there far enough to make an airway Unfortunately they dont offer any smaller adapters Overall this product might be OK at inflating a bed but as for other inflatables that they advertise about this isnt the product to do it Very Disappointing 
Awesome airpump however it does make noise and but its only for however long you intend to use it Awesome 
This cooler is very well made and will stand up to pretty much anything you would expect a cooler to endure I use this cooler for camping mostly and it is reasonably light but built well enough to use as a chair or step stool in a pinch I use this cooler for our food and after filling it and packing with ice it will retain about 50 of the ice for about three days in 65  85 deg weather You can get a better cooler but you will spend 3 times a much I would recommend this for anyone looking for a solid cooler for years to come 
There are quite a few VERY HIGH quality ice chest on the market today so take your time and do your home work before you do the click an ship part of your purchase 
Metal and heavy duty plastic construction Heavy duty metal handles and well designed strong latch Its a Coleman Pay the extra premium over pure plastic coolers  this will last much longer 
Its basically a metal box you set on top of your Coleman stove and it traps the heat in Nice that it had a built in bottom to help diffuse the heat Takes about 1520 mins to preheat to 350 and depending on the weather  you may not get there I was camping at 11000 ft in Colorado this weekend and couldnt get above 300 on the gauge but it still cooked my cinnamon rolls well so I question how accurate the gauge is Can burn the bottom of things if you arent careful but for the money you cant do any better 
A few months back I decided to buy a Coleman stove Ive always been a fan of Coleman products So of course I have to buy some accessories to go with it lol I received it today and it seems to be a nice addition to our stove It looks like its made well It unfolds and packs up fast Cant wait to use it We have a camping trip planned for next weekend I will use it and if I have any problems with it I will edit this review 
Heard this oven was soon to be discontinued so I picked one up Unit works as expected You must watch what you are baking due to many variables Ambient temperature wind BTU out put of the stove The thermometer is there only as a guide With that said The unit works as expected Cooked refrigerated biscuits and corn muffins ok Easily colapses for transport and storage Should provide years of service 
I have been wanting one of these for quite a while but the local prices just seemed too high I finally purchased at the Amazon price One caution the bottom edges of the sides are a little sharp Running your finger across them might result in a cut 
I purchased this to car camp The folding design is really innovative I also purchased a baking stone to place in the bottom to cook on and to help hold and distribute heat within the oven My first use involve cooking a piece of salmon Typically at home I cook salmon for approximately 10 minutes at 350 degrees I used the included pan placed on the rack Even with a two burner stove with both units on high I could not get the oven to go higher than 225 At least thats what the door thermometer read I wrapped the top of the oven in foil too It was not windy The foil didnt really seem to help much Nonetheless the salmon cooked after 35 minutes Therefore my initial impression is that it may be a challenge to cook other items such as baking a potato 51014 Update On my second use of the oven I had much greater success Using the same two burner stove with both burners on I got the oven to 350375 degrees I cook a medium size potato in 1 hour and a piece of salmon in 15 minutes I did not change anything from the first time but the weather was warmer It seems the weather conditions an play a big part in how the oven functions 8114 update Baked thin crust pizza Oven never got above 300 degrees but it did a good job perhaps because it was thin crust It only took about 25 minutes too 
I have not used this item but it appears to be constructed well I purchased the camp oven for our emergency kit we are compiling I have used Coleman products for 60 plus years and have been very pleased with the products I have purchased 
High quality flat folding oven by Coleman It is 12x12x12 when opened and folds flat to about 12x12x3 in the box You will need to make sure your bakeware is small enough for this little oven allowing an inch all around for airflow and even heating you should not exceed 10 inches on the longest edge Use the side shields on your camp stove if theres any wind otherwise the heat is blown away and takes longer to bake Use the thermometer to adjust flames when you reach the desired temperature  I preheat on high and then turn down to hold that temperature 
this stove works great and lives up to coleman standards it even worked good in the heavy coastal winds of Rodanthe NC in november which is saying something for its performance 
hard to beat what this thing does for the space it takes up 
I bought this about 3 years ago and never really got it out to use it until about 6 months ago I think this unit is a little hard to manage due to being so tall At first the flame adjustment knob did not seem to provide much adjustability it was so stiff I called and complained to Coleman and they sent me a twoburner stateoftheart new FyreCadet stove as a replacement Wow it sure is nice But back to the review of this product After Coleman sent me the replacement stove I decided to give this Coleman Bottle Top Propane Stove another try before giving it away Well guess what This time the flame adjustment know worked great I felt like I should have given Coleman an apology Since they had already given me a replacement stove I decided to go ahead and give this Coleman Bottle Top Propane Stove to the Boy Scouts I have asked since then and they tell me it is still working fine So I give this product a thumbs up now 
I love this stove for cooking stuff while out on the ice fishing and camping I carry one in the back of each of my cars That way I can always pick up a can of soup on the way and have a warm meal 
Hey it works What more can you say 
Great price Great value 
The Coleman Battery Powered Lantern casts a bright light and is great as a backup light in an emergency I do not know how easy it will be to replace the circular compact fluorescent bulb when it burns out 
Long usage and great cooler for the price over time the sides started to delaminate not sure if I would buy another newer coleman again 
Not quite like the one I remember my folks having back in the 80sbut solid nice and nostalgic Heyif the new swivel latch keeps a child from asphyxiating in a cooler I can live with it  even if its not quite as snug as the old version I really wish theyd put a threadon drain cap on these Id have no hesitation at all about anyone 250 sitting on this around camp Some crediblelooking online reviews also had this rated in terms of ice retention right up there with coolers that cost as much as a healthy mortgage payment 
Best cooler ever I already had the stainless steel one but have always wanted coleman to come out with an all black one and they did I only wished that there wasnt any white showing but thats ok Ill take it 
The oven conveys a very neat idea but in practice a single walled design means that around 95 of the heat put into the bottom just goes out the sides and not into the item youre trying to bake On one propane burner cranked up high enough to melt titanium I could only get the door thermometer to read 275F  and that after 45 minutes I understand that its designed to fit over two burners apparently spaced on a Coleman stove but look for the BTUs output in ONE burner I should have been able to bake about three loaves of bread instead of barely getting a tuna casserole to bubble Like I said in the title of this review Im sure this oven is great if you have infinite fuel at hand And really if you do then why do you even need an oven 
This is very low cost low weight and small footprint when folded for a camping oven I used it for the first time this last weekend on a pot pie It will allow me to add baked goods to my camping trips without the cost size and weight of more elaborate camp ovens It will take some practice to regulate heat and cook things to a golden brown but the product does everything it is supposed to do Folds neatly back into its rather small box for storage and transport Used on a two burner propane camp stove Tips Wind will make it difficult to use this product out in the open unless you take steps to block the wind I use middle rack position and cover the top of my baked goods with foil especially around the edges to keep it from burning for at least part of the cooking time Lastly cant be a looky looo and open it to check on it frequently Every time you do will cool off the oven and increase cooking time Enjoy Works great with practice 
Great little kit for setting up a tent at a campsite would not use this if you were backpacking 
Perfect camping tools 
Nice little kit to keep with your tent It would be better if the web page was replaced with a solid material bag 
a must have for any tent owner 
The stake puller alone makes this thing worth it Nice package 
I like this items 
Happy I purchased this Quality products Highly recommend 
Steak puller hook bends easily 
I bought this for 20 bucks and I cant believe how well this stove works It heats water very fast and is pretty quiet I can adjust it down or up with no problem I used it this year in my deer blind and it was prefect 
This is great stove Light and portable Used it for 11 days in tent during Elk hunt Loved this little stove 
we have cooked all kinds of glorious meals while camping using this bottle top stove The flame is so well focused it would not have been an issue to boil water in a pot in pretty bad wind I have a shield to protect from wind issues but it turned out to be unnecessary other than keeping the pans evenly heated it holds various pots and pans well with its stepped design 
Honestly Ive owned a lot of Coleman gear over the years Its a camping staple So Youd think that theyd get something as simple as a single burner down Well it still works but after first use  cooking on high for 45 min plastic adjusting knob wont turn to off or low its frozen in place 
works great just the thing to have just in case 
Great little burner 
Great product It made me smile I liked it so much I think I cried when it arrived Simply AWESOME 
This pump works fine and although it does make a fair amount of noise it is not so loud as people would have you think in other reviews Much better than the battery operated air pump 
Arrived on time and works perfectly quickly pumping up an air mattress in just a few minutes It does what its designed to do no more and no less 
This item works very quickly and efficiently but it is noisy So consider using it before folks go to bed 
Came in super handy 
Got these super discounted on an amazon deal of the day Mallet is heavy and solid quality as is the dusbin  brush and tent stakes The REI kingdom 6 tent I bought users recommend extra stakes and lines so Ill have a use for all of these 
Nice as backup tools for tent set up 
Arrived as described 
Bought this oven to use with our two burner Camp Chef propane cook stove at the camper It is not big but will hold muffins biscuits and small roaster Have not used it yet but friends have one  LOVE IT 
Have been part of a broken glass thermometer But I just decided to write You could not fire heating to be bent 
The temp gage shows approximately 50 degrees cooler than the actual temp Made with very thin material It works with some practice and after determining the actual temp 
Works ok 
Use it to roast coffee outdoors using a whirley pop popcrn popper Superb in this role as you can place it sheltered from wind Plenty of BTUs 
This thing puts out a lot of heat for such a small stove We used it for a campingfly fishing trip I thought the setup may not be very stable but as long as you place it on a stable platform  in our case it was a sturdy camping table it would work well Consider that this stove will be top heavy so do not leave it unattended I will not use this in a very busy campsite  kids playing rough housing 
With the advent of stormy weather I decided to buy this propane stove in the event the power goes out Primarily to make coffee When the stove came today I immediately tried it out It was super easy to assemble Just screw the propane tank purchased separately into the top part screw this little piece that said Coleman onto the burner and put the whole thing into the stand Turned it on lit it with a lighter and adjusted the flame Super easy I put a tea pot on top and heated water Took about as long as it would on my normal stove Worked great 
Great little stove does what I need done 
This is the perfect pump for air mattresses it inflates them in seconds It can also deflate them quickly and completely so you can store them easily The cord isnt the longest but you can move the air mattress closer to the electrical outlet or use an extension cord Also the two nozzles come hooked together with a little bandtype gadget making it easy to keep all parts in one spot because while youre using one nozzle it is also keeping the other nozzle attached in a way Would definitely recommend this pump 
This pump just comes in really handy We use it to blow up a bed but it comes in handy for other things that need air It has a lot of power for the price 
Cons  The drain is a simple cap held on by friction A cooler this size really needs a screw on cap Childproofing the lid has made the closing latch almost useless The closing latch completely failed in one summer season The cooler never left the safety of my truck bed and belted in place I absolutely will not purchase this item again 
Looks like the old time cooler Except for the can opener We love this for all our trips Keeps everything cold 
I have not been able to get the temperature above 350 degrees which includes wrapping it in foil It folds up very well for easy transport 
I bought this for my wife as present She loves to cook and when we were on a camping tour she missed a small oven for both of us This fullfills our requirement Its simply folded up and put on our Coleman dual fuel camp oven It makes everything from rolls to roasts eqsily After usage simply fold it away in one piece I recommend to purchase matching forms and plates for the oven nice complement 
I bought this oven to expand the feeding ritual while camping I have baked bread pies and a variety of everyday type items over a camp fire and when placed on a small wood burning stove in my tent This is wonderful I have a smallish 10 X 14 tent and when baking bread or cookies wow does the tent and surrounding woods smell great My wife also uses this oven while were camping and she loves it too I would recommend this item for anyone that wants to add another level of comfort to a camp trip 
Thanks Coleman and Amazon I had to have this oven so I could do some BBQd turkey legs like I had at a local eatery last week My cookin was not as good but the oven worked great I recommend this product to anyone who loves to cook on a campstove and who likes the idea of extending the camp grub menu I like this oven so much I may order another one for the other burner I also like the easy cleanup and the thermometer that seems to be quite accurate Cooking time for the turkey legs at 350 deg was about 2 hours the same as I would have cooked them in my oven at home After cool down and cleanup I folded it down to its storage size of about 12 x 12 x 2 and that was that I recommend this oven and I recommend Amazon as your dealer of choice I am now a ahem happy camper 
this is one heavy duty burner I was expecting something a bit flimsier for the price but this baby did it up right Heated up my coffee in no time flat on the cold mornings I would say i would buy again but i have a feeling this will last me for many years to come 
Worked awesomely  took it camping and people were going nuts with big kitchen sets and i was done with my stuff in mins 
Perfect for hunting  camping 
Nice 
excellent 
love this item for a quick and easy pump inflate for a camping trip so glad we purchased it before our latest trip 
After recently purchasing a camper that had a stove but no oven my family was faced with either giving up some of our favorite breakfast foods like biscuits and cinnamon rolls and easy bake desserts like brownies or buy a stand alone oven that would work on a camp stove like this Coleman While we have only used it on one trip so far it performed well for what it is and can be improved upon with a little knowledge and preplanning First of all several reviewers have mentioned how this oven cooks at a higher temp than the simple temperature guage reads This seems to be true for mine as well I am guessing based on cook time that at a reading of 350 degrees the oven was closer to 400 or a bit higher Even checking the rolls a few minutes earlier than the earliest cook time at 400 degrees the bottoms got a bit burned at 350 degrees Try cooking at a lower temperature and taking your time to avoid brown or crusty rollbuscuitcornbread bottoms Unless your guage is closer to true temps than mine you would be better off to assume the reading is 2550 degress cool and cook accordingly Another tip is to move foods that will fit to one of the top two racks when cooking This can also help the top side of your baked goods heat up a little better and more evenly with the bottom of the pan Finally use as thick and heavy a pan as will fit andor locate a small round or small rectangular pizza stone that will fit inside on the bottom of the oven to help regulate the heat intensity and hold temperature better when opening the door to check progress With just a little effort this Coleman Camp Oven can work pretty well despite its light weight and construction Also folds down flat for easy transporting 
just right 
I lost the first one of these I bought so bought this replacement it works great 
Works great and perfect for car camping 
Now I am ready for the next camping trip I love it 
Very nice product 
This pump stopped working after only 18 months It was not used more that 10 times and it was well cared for Worked well to inflate air mats prior to failure Should have lasted much longer Im now out of warranty 
This is so much better than its battery powered counterpart The performance is great and and the construction seems solid 
It is very loud as other reviews have stated Also I found it a little disconcerting that the cord has a tag urging you to wash your hands immediately after use due to the content of lead int he cording Im not sure if this is normal for appliances or not Maybe it just happened to catch my eye this time Regardless I bought this as a cheap solution to blow up balloons for balloon stands as I am a party planner It worked perfectly 
This is great with a propane stove Ive cooked a few things with this and still love this Does take a little getting used to but the temp guage helps a lot We love this to bake with 
Now that I fixed the thing it works pretty much as advertised When I first went to pull mine out of the box both of the spot welds that hold the handle on the top let go allowing the stove to crash to the floor and leaving me holding the wire handle I could see how the welds could break given the weight of this thing I usually hike to my campsites and only infrequently do the car camp thing where you can see your vehicle from your tent THATs the type of trips this oven will be going on That all being said Now that I drilled a couple of holes in the top so I could reattach the handle with a couple of pop rivets its up and running It does work just like a home oven and fits neatly on my Coleman camp stove Biscuits come out nicely browned and I made a pretty decent lasagna in it The temperature gauge works well as does the little door latch The oven rack is adjustable so that between regulating your oven flame and the rack height you can get pretty decent results Setting it up and tearing it down only takes a few seconds once you get the hang of it It should go without saying that youll want to let it cool down before trying to stow it Duh All in all despite the hassle with the handle Im happy with it In fact if not for the handle issue Id be giving it five stars I have to think mine was the exception here but hey that happens 
Great product Thank you 
Everything you need to take down your tent easy to use nice little tote to carry around with 
My son goes to lots of weekend music festivals and camps out and really appreciated this great price fast shipping 
Handy and compact for camping 
I use an ice chest every day and bought it hoping it would do a better job of keeping things cold without giving up storage space I am very pleased Ice stays frozen twice as long The latches work well handles are strong I cant find anything I dont like about it 
I left a shorter review of this cooler earlier but after further use wanted to return to leave a more comprehensive review INTRODUCTION I purchased this cooler on the recommendation of a friend who had several at a tailgate party I attended After searching around for the best price I settled on purchasing the green colored cooler which was the cheapest at the time from Amazon As a prime eligible purchase it arrived two days later in perfect condition Absolutely no dings scratches or dents like other reviews mention It was perfectly packaged in factory boxes APPEARANCE The cooler is plastic encased in steel The colored portion you see is steel whereas the white portion is plastic Some people seem to believe this cooler is all steel It is not It is steel belted as the description clearly states The latch is metal and plastic The handles are also metal but with plastic grips The coolers appearance is stylish Also there is NO bottle opener on this version of the cooler Some reviews allude to the presence of a bottle opener on the outside of the cooler There is certainly not one on the version I ordered FUNCTIONALITY AND USE Hands down this is the best cooler I have ever owned I take a lot of road trips and travel a lot for work and used to carry along an old generic plastic cooler with me to keep snacks water and soda This cooler has replaced my old beat up travel buddy It fits nicely in the back of my Ford Escape and has more then enough storage space for meats cheese bread yogurt fruit beer and ice I can stock it with enough food for a 35 day trip easily The cooler keeps ice for about two to three days outside of extreme temperatures Two or three two liter bottles of ice are enough to keep everything cold for at least 2 says If necessary the ice can be supplemented with a bag of two from the motel to get you through the last day or two of your trip I do not use the chemical ice packs except one small one see below but they might last a little longer Now just one thing to consider before you purchase this item The cooler can get heavy especially when fully loaded Of course it depends on what you put in the cooler but I have loaded mine up to what was probably more then fifty pounds That can be a lot of weight to carry especially longer distances Unless you are a large burly man dont plan on carry this cooler fully loaded around all day long The plastic grips do a good job of stopping the handles from cutting into your hands when carrying and it is on the heavy side To get around this limitation I keep a small cold pack in the cooler and a small insulated bag I got as a freebie at a convention Whenever I need to take something from the car to a different location and do not want to lug the entire cooler I just place what I need in the insulated bag with the cold pack TIPS 1 Dont waste your money buying bagged ice at convenience stores Fill recycled two liter bottles 34 way full of water and freeze them Use these bottles as ice packs It will not only save you the mess of melted ice but also a few dollars because you wont have to buy ice 2 Make sure to chill everything that will go in the cooler at least overnight This will help extend the life of the ice in the cooler 3 It is useful to keep something like a bottle opener or cork screw in your cooler Even a small folding knife can be a lifesaver when you need to cut open a package or some food CONCLUSION This cooler is well worth the money Yes you can find cheaper alternatives in stores and online But the value of this cooler cannot be surpassed You may save a few dollars by buying a generic plastic cooler but those savings will quickly be lost with all your ice purchases and loss of food due to heat 
We had the best biscuits and cinnamon rolls ever during our last camping trip Who wouldve thought that this little square box would work so well Set the camp stove temp to medium to preheat and watch the temp gauge on the door Dont leave it once you put the food in the oven to monitor the temp But by adjusting your flame you can increase or decrease the oven temperature I also used the disposable mini casserole pans from the grocery store It made clean up so easy afterwards The toaster oven tray sets seem to run just a little big for this camp oven 
Will this bake bread yes Will it come together with a working door and fully attached handle no The oven itself is a great little addon for those who do not want to bake in a Dutch oven I have made bread and muffins in mine and I can think of many other uses for future camping trips But the handle was only soldered in on one side and broke one the first use and the door knob is just cheap So if you are looking for a metal oven that breaks down here it is If you are looking for a great piece of camping hardware for the long term this isnt it But then again at 40 its an ok deal 
So far I have made biscuits in this oven and they turned out perfectly One thing to keep in mind is that when you open the door to place something in it the door thermo suddenly reads much cooler than the inside temp actually is Just place the food item in there and cook for the correct amount of time 
I use this oven to cook while camping and also hunting Its main purpose is to cook biscuits and other baked items in a duck blind Works great once you get the hang of it 
Unfortunately I havent had a chance to actually use it yet though so maybe after I do Ill post an update 
Essential when backpacking or warming up food on my lunch without a microwave in sight Useed it for a weekend of camping and heated food fast  10000 BTUs is a must 
I backpack with this yes its big and clunky but it sure heats fast and it holds a big pot or pan The bottle also takes up a lot of room in a pack but for the price and the amount of times I back pack a year it works fine for me No messing with liquid the bottles are cheap not like the super small high tech canisters I also have an emergency back up if we loose power Little on the tippy side put some rocks around the plastic foot to avoid the stove tipping over

I bought a coleman tent and the only thing I read about it was that you might as well get new stakes So I found this tent kit and Im so happy I did Awesome set up The stakes work great the little broom is indispensable when your trying to get all the dirt out of the tent and the little lantern hook is always in use Only down side was the mallet After using it for more than 3 months limited use the rubber mallet end broke right off the wood handle I kept the rubber mallet end just because it still works to hit the stakes down but that is the only reason why this great kit got a 4 star instead of 5 Still a great purchase and I would get it again 
The plastic portion of the spikes should really be made out of metal I would pay more just so i dont have to continue to replace these We have clay and rock in colorado and these spikes tend to break when you are trying to remove them from the ground The bag could be a little more rouged as you are putting pointed objects in it 
I think this kit would be good for softer ground It certainly has the things you need But we took it camping to a clayrocky soil location The stakes certainly held our tent in place but then they wouldnt come out of the ground We ended up bending the hook that pulls them out and also ended up with the plastic end of the stake itself breaking They were certainly better than the stakes that came with the tent though and the broom and hammer are both nice accessories to have 
Great product 
Ive had two of these now  although they work great they dont last long One a fan part broke in it  rattled around  the other just overheated  died The hose is the most irritating part  if you loose this miniature clip it will continue to vibrate off So then you have to keep the hose on the unit with one hand  the other on the valve to blow it up Not fun They typically last me 12 years of blowing up a few pool toys The round design also makes it difficult to stabilize if you arent holding it A flat bottom works better The only good part is that it does blow things up quickly 
Bought this to inflate pools beach balls etc Does an excellent job and does it very quickly Comes with the various adapters for nozzles that are likely to be found on those type of toys Also comes with clear instructions I inflated a large toddlers pool and did it in under three minutes In use the noise is not much more than a hair dryer and outside the noise is less noticable The exhaust valve on the pump becomes the reverse port to deflate the toy The pump weighs only a few ounces and is easily connected to any pool or inflatable toy I was concerned that the price was so low but the Coleman name convinced me I am very happy with the purchase 
I write this as a eulogy to my Coleman air pump I paid 20 for it 5 years ago and its the best 20 I ever spent I have sent this pump to hell and back  several times Were campers and boaters and my kids are outdoor freaks  air mattresses inflatable pools bounce houses intertubes water islands backyard and on and on  too much I used to lug around an air compressor with me everywhere and was surprised to find this thing pumps out substantially more air than a 120psi high pressure air compressor Like the other reviewer said  its just a fan  not made for high pressure but it IS made for high velocity This pump has ran like a champ since the day we bought it We take it on the boat in the motorhome and it has a permanent spot in my garage next to the compressor I use it for everything It gets tossed into storage bins left outside fallen on the ground a few times rolls around in the back of the truck take it down to the sand etc Its been beat up about as much as anything could get beat Mine has an 18 extender hose on it which looks like its been removed from the product since I bought mine  too bad I always use the hose and I think I would be bummed out if I lost it After 5 years I can hear the motor finally conking out Its not dead yet but I cant risk being stranded without it  its way too valuable Because we do have so many inflatables and some of them are really really big Im going to step it up and try out the Kwik Tek High Pressure this time around Ill keep the Coleman until it dies completely but Im curious to see if the Kwik Tek can fill the Coleman shoes I feel an obligation to offer my support for this little champ It did really really great and if my Kwik Tek disappoints Im back to the Coleman for sure If youre looking for a GREAT pump and cant decide what to get I highly recommend the Coleman  for the price durability and function its a winner 
I like the Coleman oven a lot I had one of the earlier versions years ago This one has a thermometer I cooked biscuits and muffins and was successful with both When camping without electricity this oven gives you lots of great cooking options 
I am getting too old to really rough it anymore I was not aware that Coleman has been making this camp oven for years It fit perfectly on top of my Coleman two burner stove It is well built out of thin gauge steel Though it folds flat for storage It folds open in seconds  really   Put it on top of the main burner preheat it to the temperature you want  the thermometer is in the door  and bake like at home We baked dinner rolls our first night and for breakfast we had cinnamon buns The whole campground smelled great 
Tossed in with tent kit looks and feels like a solid piece of kit 
Love this 
hard to get broom back inside bag 
If your back packing its a way to go Otherwise for care camping just get a 2 burner 
Great stove Not too big not too small Doesnt take up much space I use it for kayak and light backpacking trips Very stable 
great stove would buy again 
I purchased this one after my last coleman battery operated one died This one works great for around the house for blowing up the air mattress when guests come over it is pressty loud but arent they all All in all it is a wonderful product And the pump fills my queen air mattress in just a few minutes 
Very good pump Do the job quickly Just in case  if you want to power up it from car power inverter it impossible until you dont have 800W or 1KW inverter 
Bought this to fill a Coleman Queen air mattress Worked great and not any louder than the air pump we had that broke recently But when I tried to use it to fill a twin mattress from another company we found out that the narrow adapter that came with the pump didnt have a long enough shape to open the flap at the end of the valve so no air would flow in I dont know if the issue is that the twin mattress is strange we got it at Target right by the pumps the only way we could get any air to move into the mattress was to blow it by mouth while squeezing the valve stem but squeezing the valve stem while using the pump didnt allow air in Hope I dont have the same problem trying to fill the inflatable pool this summer 
I wanted a super rugged cooler what I got was a cooler that was expensive and looks rugged The surface that gets the most wear is plastic and the metal wrapping is paper thin disappointed 
Lickity split and the mattress is filled Much better than our battery operated one All you need is an outlet Excellent 
It held ice for over 24 hrs looks amazing and is solid The latch is a little flimsy but Coleman has many replacement parts if needed When you pull your cold PBR out of this bad boy at the beach you will have major cooler envy and people will automatically flock to you and ask to be your friend AMERICA 
Great set for camping Its nice to have these extra pieces in one compact bag to travel with 
I got this in just in time to go camping this weekend at Pedernales Falls State Park I go so mad after my last camping trip a couple of weeks ago because I had let my girls borrow our tent and they didnt bother to sweep it out before packing it back up and they lost three stakes and my hammer I had to use my hand to sweep the tent out and I am surprised it didnt blow away since it wasnt staked down very well This is the perfect little campers helper kit and it all comes in a nice mesh carry bag Definitely give this a two thumbs up 
Very happy with my order 
Perfect tool kit for tent set up and take down 
We used it to make coffee in a percolator pot when the power went out 
nice 
We love this for tent camping 
Love it Used it on the last camping trip to make some applewood smoked bacon on the frying pan 
Theres a reason why this is a classic This oneburner is the most stable Ive used Will boil your coffee cook your beans and take a skillet of about 10 inches in diameter One canister meets my needs for at least two days of use 
I wish it had a starter on the unit 
Hello and I must state this PUNP DOES the JOB and when you turn it YOU WILL KNOW IT WILL Just leave any small items laying arond it because when sucks for air to pump out it will suck the peanut butter right off your sandwich LOL 
I love this cooler period It reminds me of the kind of coolers we had when I was a kid And made in the USA 
i returned not made with the same durability as in the past the cooler does not suction shut their is play even when the latch is locked i sent it back 
I purchased two without doing my homework boy do I regret it Yes it is very cool looking but very poorly constructed The latch broke off is unfixable and drain is easily pulled out causing water to leak at inconvenient time Truly this cooler was used twice once for a day boat trip and an overnight camping trip thats it I was going to give second one as wedding gift but dont feel right given experience with mine Contacting Coleman is not worth your time I am stuck No recourse Bought from vendor on Amazon they wont return because it has been two weeks past a year DO NOT BUY 
This oven is truly unique and amazing for camping or patio fun As a father of two camping sons  this oven performed flawlessly Used it on a propane stove Great for keeping or rewarming food too A must have for any outdoor activity 
I originally bought a Primus stove and canisters for my earthquake kit I have since found out that the Coleman stove is much more versatile Also the Coleman propane fuel canisters are MUCH more available and much CHEAPER I have used this camp stove with a 16oz propane bottle in conjunction with a lightweight boy scout aluminum cook set and it has lasted me more than a week This product is great I highly recommend it 
Perfect when cooking with an 8inch skillet or 12 quart pot 
Not recommended for longer trips as it is bulky and a little heavy I left the base at home and just used rocks to support the propane bottle while in use We took it on a week long wilderness trip and it was very durable I think I will try and find a smaller one for the next trip 
Yoooooo why did I not have this before Super easy to set up boils water way faster than my athome stove Simple ignition Compact packaging Love 
Works great for beach camping 
Perfect Very strong good fit in your hand with two to four keys absolutely perfect I dont even never write reviews 
Price was way too high for product 
works just as it should get it for camping and cooking a quick meal 
This kit made putting up the tent cleaning it and taking it down much easier 
Def glad we bought this The broom broke within one weekend but the hammer was great The stakes were very helpful and great quality The bag it comes in is to small in my opinion 
Very complete set Easy to use Thank you 
The mallet smells absolutely horrid smelled it outside the box it came in so I had to leave it outside to air out Other than that I feel this will serve me very well for my next camping trip 
My husband decided that he wants fresh made biscuits on his camping trips and I voted for nutty fudge brownies SOOOO 
The cooler does a good job of keeping its contents cool We have had the cooler for four years The only problem we have encountered was the separation of the seamed side of the cooler from the insulation The separation seems not to affect the insulative properties of the cooler Coleman suggested that heat might have caused the insulation to expand and cause the separation Four stars instead of five because of this bulging 
The pugs and I love this cooler  The ice last all weekend long for our camping trips and 4 day travels on the road Keeps our food chilled and sodawater cold Always wanted a metal cooler just like my Dad and Grandpa still have 
I purchased this cooler for my husband for his birthday If I would have gotten it elsewhere I would have paid WAY over 100 Because I bought it on Amazoncom I paid WAY under and did not even have to pay for the shipping It is the best steelbelted cooler on the market and my husband was VERY pleasantly surprised He had been wanting one all his life I not only surprised him but made him very happy too 
I used this to inflate anbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal href75x70x24SwimCenterOceanReefPooldpB00005OARQrefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTF875 x 70 x 24 Swim Center Ocean Reef Poola It worked fast and easily  inflated the entire big pool in about twenty minutes It seems wellbuilt and had a quality sort of sound to it I also like that it has an onoff switch unlike other similar pumps Ive used that are on when theyre plugged in and off when theyre not Yes this thing is a bit on the loud side but not too bad Id say its comparable to a hairdrier on high The worst of the noise is very much directional so you can make things quite a bit better by keeping the front of your face pointed right at the top of the pump 
Others posted this thing is noisy enough to make your ears bleed Whatever Its as noisy as any other electric pump Ive used theyre all pretty much the same This one comes wtwo attachments one is for blowing up regular floaty things like beach balls kids arm floaties pool accessories etc The other is bigger and used for blow up mattresses and the larger ports on inflatable boats For the SevylorColeman boats for which this is great because you need both attachments you can blow up the 5 chambers 3 of the little types for the boat bottom and the seats and 2 big ones for the left and right sides of the boat in about 5 minutes or less 
This thing is cool easy to set up and lights right up Will be nice to have in an emergency or camping hike 
This stove is great for cooking if you are camping but its bigger size takes up too much space in a backpack making it NOT ideal for backpacking The stove top itself was big and stable making it easy to cook on It was a good product and would recommend it for many campers 
Takes 12 min to make coffee in the percolator on high A lot better than the old one Easy to use in the morning before coffee  sturdy compact  adjustable  not self starting need a flame source  if it lasts 2 years I would buy another one 
Excelente 
Handy to clean and get the rent posts in the ground 
Love it Good buy  
I bought this at the last minute before a camping trip so I would have a mallet to pound in stakes The entire kit came in handy My daughter played with the broom I used the stake puller which is nifty but I never would have bought on its own and I used the extra stakes to splint my broken tent pole I did notice that the bag pictured is not what I received Where that picture looks like a solid cloth of some sort mine is a mesh Not really a deal breaker for me but it does allow things the stakes especially to poke through 
Pretty amazing Im not really an outdoorsy type so Id never before set up a tent But using the mallet to hammer in the tent poles and the pin remover to take them out was really quite fun 
Keeps ice stuff stays cold One note it isnt like the all metal cooler my grandfather had bought about 50 years ago This is a modern plastic cooler wrapped in steel with Coleman on it I do miss the bottle opener on the ends The one he had you could set a grenade off next to it and it would have survived Dont get me wrong I like the cooler but Im old enough to remember the all metal ones from years ago 
After having a number of plastic coolers I opted for the classic Coleman Steel cooler Although heavier than plastic it is more sturdy and appears to keep the contents cooler much longer Would recommend to anyone 
It pumped the beds in about 1 minute each A little louder than I thought but pumps so fast it doesnt matter 
Excellent very good I recommend it 
I use it as a household cleaning device It blows stuff out of hardtoreach places Its wonderful for cleaning out the inside of a computer Its more powerful than canned air and more portable and easier to use than an air compressor I had been using the rechargeable version of this product The charge would last only for about 2 minutes of use I like this one much better I attach it to a long extension cord and can pretty much use it anywhere 
I bought this oven to compliment my recent purchase of a StoveTec rocket stove The idea was to be able to bake bread or rolls in a camping or emergency situation This worked out better than I could have imagined One full size loaf of bread baked to golden brown perfection in about 25 minutes 
The Coleman ovens have been around since at least 1960 from what I can find The fact that the design exists today nearly unchanged is a tribute to the product itself Unlike the early steel models Newer models are made of lighterweight aluminum The Coleman ovens are designed to sit on top of the traditional box type Coleman two or three burner stoves with the heat of a single burner providing the heat They work best in windless environments with the temperature over 50 degrees In windy environments andor temperatures approaching 30 degrees F or less The oven is more finicky with the temperature more difficult to control and maintain In these challenging conditions the baking can have hot spots where four biscuits cooking at the same time might have two perfect and two burned Getting the tops of food to brown without burning the bottom takes a lot of experience and is something I have not mastered So the oven is not perfect but that is all part of the camping cooking experience  to try to achieve perfection in more challenging environments You can enhance the performance of the oven by draping a couple sheets of aluminum foil around the oven when using it The Coleman oven does expand the camp menu significantly Now you can have pizza at camp which is a novelty Instead of griddle cakes you can have muffins Instead of fried eggs you can have quiche If you have picky eaters or new campers the Coleman oven can bring some familiarity and comfort by offering foods typically enjoyed at home The Coleman oven is a fun device that adds a bit of a thrill for both the cook and the outdoor diners Imagine having hot pizza or hot brownies right at your favorite lakeside campground in the middle of nowhere 
Nice for camping 
happy to have it 
Very pleased with the product 
Mallet worked great to pound tent stakes into the ground the puller really helped to get them out of the ground when time to pack up The bag holds everything together nicely and is mesh so it airs out well and doesnt hold in a lot of dirt Definitely something you need for your tent when camping because the stakes that come with those tents are pretty weak 
Plastic on top of the stakes break pretty easily Hook isnt the easiest thing to remove stakes Broom and dustpan really come in handy really need a claw hammer to replace the rubber mallet and the hook 
very durable and the carry bag comes in very handy 
Great quality Works as described 
great pkg deal  every thing in one bag  
I used this camping up at Mt St Helens this last June for Fathers day and it worked wonderfully 
Excellent for car camping and does its job very well The stove and the stand are odd shaped items to pack up with our camping gear I recommend keeping the box and cardboard insert for packingstorage 
Works great Ive used it a few times for camping 
it works 
I just purchased the 54 quart stainless steel belted chest cooler The lid latch does not hold the lid down tight and there is no tray in the cooler like the old ones I am quite disappointed with the product 
Our family goes camping about once a month and in the South Texas summers that means keeping anything cold for very long is a real challenge We had one of the other famous brands plastic coolers but by the end of day two we had nothing but cool water sloshing around in the bottom of it I bought this one two trips ago and absolutely love it We put a 20lb bag of ice in one our way out of town Friday afternoon and still have 15lb in it for the drive home Sunday night On the downside its extremely heavy and has no wheels It also dents pretty easily 
No complaints It is what it is  a highend cooler that keeps cold stuff cold Steel does conduct heat so dont be a doofus and leave it sitting in the sun Bonus point for the locking latch Youll appreciate that when you drop the cooler and it rolls off the trail and down the hill but all of your chow stays locked inside Aside from camping we used this cooler to store the contents of our refrigerator during a recent longterm power outage If there was a bigger version Id buy it too 
This thing is AWESOME Looks cool works great THIS OVEN IS NOT FOR USE OVER A CAMPFIRE When used on a propane camp stove It will NOT twist and deform like some reviewers claim For those using the oven in a very COLD or WINDY environment You WILL have more trouble keeping the heat high COMMON SENSE MUST PREVAIL Some reviewers claim that it wont reach baking temps without wrapping the oven in aluminum foil That is a dead giveaway that they are baking in a windy or cold area If you have that ELUSIVE characteristic called COMMON SENSE You will absolutely love this camp oven 

This product is made well it works great and I think its a must have if you use an air mattress It blows up stuff quick 
Its a bit noisy but its also fast The noise is really no big deal as long as others arent already sleeping It seriously just takes a minute or two tops Great product at a great price 
I needed an air pump to inflate a full sized air mattress This was cheap and worked perfectly 
Ive been waiting for these to become available again I remember when they first came out in 2001 as the special 100th aniversary limited edition My neighbor got one in the Spring and I was so impressed with how well the cooler kept beverages cold I just had to get one Alas they sold out so quickly and it seemed that whenever one was available somewhere itd be gone before I could get it Id been looking to get one from Amazon since last year and again the frenzy from everyone wanting them kept causing this cooler to be sold out frequently I placed an order for it four 4 times and every time I thought Id be getting it an email would arrive a few days later stating the stock was depleted Well finally I saw them on Amazon again at a really good price too so I bought it and actually got one Now everyone that sees it marvels at the clean appearence and sharp looking design Not to mention how well it keeps MY beverages cold Needless to say Im pleased with the Coleman Steel Belted Cooler and plan on having it for years to come Now back to some yard work so I can enjoy a frosty cold beverage when Im done 
The Coleman 54 quart steelsided cooler immediately takes you back to a different time It is wonderfully built with metal handles riveted to the body of the unit The metal latch is a major plus as this cooler will do most of its duty for me riding in the back of a sidebyside While the price may initially scare some compare this cooler with other allplastic coolers of similar size The difference isnt much compared with what you get 
simple and very basic but inexpensive and a must have on a camping trip it really made the tent set up so much easier 
Necessary when trying to put up a tent Has worked perfectly 
sturdy little single burner stovelove it 
Mine is somewhere on Dauphin Island I used the stove on a very long kayak trip It stopped working on Dauphin Island so I left it there Hopefully someone can make it work again It wouldnt let gas from the cylinder go through it anymore The stove had a hard short life I probably could have fixed it but figured Id upgrade to something more dependable smaller and lighter 
this worked great Blew up the entire pool in less than a minute I would highly recommend for blowing up larger items Have not used it to do any smaller items 
You can watch my test of my oven on you tube same name cdltpx Video is named coleman oven test you can search using that title I am really frugal got my oven at a yardsale is had never been used well today I tested itafter letting it sit for years found that the oven is lacking its rack GOT IT USED FROM YARD SALE 5 NO PROBLEM but I found something to work and got on with the test Grands biscuts in my home preheated electric oven it takes exactly 14 min cook time from when I toss them in With the coleman oven 4 biscuts the cook time was more in range 15 min so I have to say this is nearly as good as a home oven and that is impressive in my book for such a low cost portable oven When it gets in your temp range it holds that temp very well Now this thing is not air tight it leaks all over the place but that is the design and it works have some foil on hand to plug some holes to assist in temp control I give it a A my home oven gets an A plus 
This is our second Coleman Oven the first lasted about 15 years When placed on a gaspropane camping stove it consistently produces the best baked potatoes we have ever eaten We have not used it to cook other items 
Im on the second summer with this little oven and love it Ive only cooked baked potatoes and canned biscuits in it and it works great Took an hour to do the potatoes and I think that was because of so much wind The biscuits I cooked just like the instructions said on the bicuit lable and they turned out great again the wind effects the cooking time A friend of mine has done Mrs Smiths pies and he said his turned out great I would recommend this to anyone I havent checked to see if the temp gauge is right on or not Like any other cooking just keep you eye on it while its cooking and you will be pleased with the results I think I purchased this from Amazon 
This reflector helps aim the light from your lantern in one direction If you are looking for light to be aimed in a specific direction this will suit your needs 
makes things really convenient when youre camping I dont know if the directions say dont hammer the stakes all the way down but dont I couldnt get one out of the ground the green plastic ripped when i used the stake puller to try to get it out the only way i was going to get it out was to shovel it out but i just chalked it up to a loss The puller works great for the smaller thinner stakes that most tents come with all in all its a pretty good buy 
Love this really handy when camping I need to order another set my son made off with the one I brought 
This was a waste of my money The mallet hammer broke after the third hit to the stake It was a nightmare after that The steel stakes though are the only good thing out of this group 
Pegs that came with my tent on my trip has two busy but these guys were great The little broom fit great into a pocket of the tent by the door and the hammer I would have bought separate it was good quality and a nice dense rubber got those metal stakes in when others failed Bought this got nothing free  
So neat The perfect survivalist campsite kit Big plus too the stakes come with plastic stake tip covers and they all come conveniently in a mesh pouch that will also hold other camping equipment Great product happy customer 
We bought this on Amazon about a year ago and have been very happy We like it so much we are going to buy a second one We have a tear drop camp trailer The stainless matches to tear drop stainless and keeps with the retro look LOOKS This is one of those coolers that people comment on and we get questions about on occasion because it is cool looking We go on short and sometimes extended camping trips Last year this cooler consistently out performed our other plastic cooler The SS Coleman with a single bag of ice keeps everything milk eggs veggies etc cold for over a week easily We do take precautions to keep it in the shade but you should do that anyway We have found it durable the lid closes tight and have had no problems with the hinges handles or anything else We are very satisfied with it and would recommend 
Every home should have one for emergency cooking 
Very good product  For the hunter outdoors person great 
Valve has stops for propane levels with the first 2 stops doing nothingno propane released  Then the next two stops fire up but are low flame on the first stop then too high flame on the next stop too hot So true adjust ability is absent thus the trouble with valve stops versus a free moving valve with no stops  TDC 
Works great will come in handy 
We tried and tried this thing and it will not come up to temperature Big burner small burner Finally a wrap of aluminum foil helped more the better looked like the dough boy Its a task Look its fun to use its just not an oven its kinda a warm warmer Yes given enough tin foil and time it would bake some cookies Got rid of it If you use it in a warm camper you have a better chance 
I have seen these ovens on store shelves most of my life I was certain that a little aluminum box could not function as an oven But recently we were embarking on a 10day camping trip and I was going to need to bake while we were there I am pretty adept at baking with coals from a campfire or a charcoal fire but on the trip in question there was a burn ban in effect What to do I got on Amazon and read reviews about the Coleman Camp Oven and decided that if my original opinion was correct Coleman wouldnt still be making this little gem I purchased the oven and it arrived when promised We took it to the campground and were totally amazed at how beautifully it worked We baked brownies biscuits potatoes cornbread and even glutenfree hamburger buns and rolls Everything was wonderful The oven was easy to set up and use But it is not like baking at home in your regular oven Tips you should know  Only use the oven on a camp stove Try to get your stove as level as possible  Start warming it up with a low flame and increase the stove flame as the oven begins to preheat  Plan to use small bakeware Coleman suggests 8x8 pans Here are some products that we found worked well nbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefNordicWareToasterOvenBakingSheetdpB00004RFS9refcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTF8Nordic Ware Toaster Oven Baking Sheeta  Ekco mini muffin pan for 12 muffins nbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefFoxRunSetofFourEnglishMuffinRingsdpB0000CFME7refcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTF8Fox Run Set of Four English Muffin Ringsanbspfor the burger buns on the baking sheet nbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefMSRBlackliteFryPandpB000FBYNIErefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTF8MSR Blacklite Fry Pana  8x8 foil pan  After your food is in the oven you really need to watch the temperature gauge from time to time The longer it bakes the more likely you will need to adjust the stove flame to regulate the temperature inside the oven This is NOT setitandforgetit baking  We found that timing was pretty close to baking at home as long as the temperature was constant  Try not to peek too often Peeking lowers the internal temperature Look when you need to  thats all  Clean up spills outside and inside as soon as the oven cools Dont let gunk bake on during the next use The oven folds up quickly when it is time to pack up We keep it in its original box and it is ready to go I still love the thrill of accomplishment of baking using a campfire but this little oven is a great addition for those times when a fire is not convenient May we all have many years of excellent campground baking Happy Camping Happy Baking Happy Eating

Pretty good deflector I installed mine with the L bracket upside down Works better on my lantern that way 
As expected 
Great product great service Exactly as advertised 
I use this every day we camp Keeps light redirected where you need it Easy in easy odd Great accessorie for your beloved Coleman multi fuel 
I still dont know if it really increased the forward light 
nice 
Good quality product except for the bag Planned on getting a bigger better bag anyway because I have more items to put in it 
simple and compact 
It was great except the rubber mallet had a strong gasoline type oder Other than that it was just what I wanted 
Great accessory kit for camping Great quality stakes and mallet The bag could have been a little bigger but it still works 
can always use backups when camping They work great 
Such a helpful kit to have 
This is a great cooler It holds a ton is strong and takes banging around It is good for dragging stuff for a family outing to the park or for car camping Not a backpackable cooler mind you but this is the heirloom cooler you will want for decades We use ours as a minifridge in a lake cabin and it keeps stuff cold with occasional changes of ice or cooler blocks 
When Coleman designed this cooler they left off a way to stop the lid from opening past 90ish degrees This results in the lid opening about 180 degrees which stresses the hinges and breaks the outer stainless layer away from the inner insulation I have been through two lids and now the body of the cooler is breaking away the same way Yes it does have a 100 year warranty but I bought expecting the same build quality as my grandfathers that is 60 years old There is just no comparison Coleman also says it will keep ice for 3 days at 100 degrees This couldnt be further from the truth It will not hold ice for 24 hours at 85 degrees Bottom line Buy a good Igloo marine cooler and use the extra 70 to fill it with your beverage of choice 
The greatest little stove for car camping Not for packing in I use the same gas can for my torch at home 
Perfect 
Cumbersome Not really needed Cant find a good place to store it after using it on the lantern unless you keep it on permanently 
Great light blockerreflector and it will work on a variety of lanterns because of how its made 
OKAY 
works great 
Excellent works great 
i remember I had one of these years ago and it kept my stuff Ice Cold and kept the ice for days This Cooler is no exception It was put to the ultimate test a camping trip in 100 temps It kept the food cold and the ice stayed Well worth the money over the other coolers out there if you do a lot of camping or are an outdoors person 
Very nice I got one of these on the gold box special last week and paidwell I aint gonna tell ya what I paid because so many people bitch about the gold box I will say that it was delivered today 53107 in perfect condition Ebay has a few as I type this One of them was only used twice and the bid was up over what I paid Either way this is still worth the regular price My wife prefers coolers with rollers I agree But for that special occasion cookout with guests whathaveyou this is retro cool As a weekly cooler for trekking back and forth to the RV nah But for that price ofoh yeah Cant give away secrets I will say that it sold out immediately and Amazon released a few more which I luckily caught I should have ordered a couple Nice product for the money even at this price which is not bad with 0 tax and free shipping Ahhhwhat the heck Just to show you that checking the gold box daily is more profitable than reading your local rag of a bad news paper5999 and free shipping Check the box 
wouldnt buy if I knew what I was getting  cheap 
Great product 
Fast delivery  packaged well  good sturdy product  great gift idea for your camping friends or family 
It is what it is advertised to bea Coleman Tent kit 
Very good product 
Got this for camping and we love it I have used it for 3 years now and always take it camping with us Battery lasts a log time and we still have the original light in it When our power goes our during storms this is the first thing it get to put in the middle of the living room and it is plenty of light for that room 
Ive had one of these for years I got mine from my dad who had it for years I used it last weekend to make 4 pots of coffee in camp It worked great  again It will break down a little Youll have two round pieces that are about 6 across and the propane can Its sturdy enough to hold a 12 cup coffee pot Set up takes about 20 seconds You dont want to leave the propane screwed into the burner  over time itll leak out Note that you need a match to light it 
Item as promised quickly shipped 
We used this on a recent trip and it performed well I did not cook on it but boiled water several times We were in 3050 degree weather and it took 58 minutes to boil water on the highest setting When not attached to a bottle it is extremely small light weight and easy to pack 
This is a good stove ideal to have not only for a base camp no way would you backpack with this but for home emergency use as wellthough I hasten to add not for use indoors Its sturdy enough to accommodate most uses that involve frying or boiling water and with a 1 lb propane bottle you get some very good use time The flow control gives you some decent versatility and you end up with a wide range of temperatures from a gentle simmer to Full Afterburner Its also not just a decent size but its shape lets you pack it away fairly easily with little wasted space And Ive found it to be built quite well Its sturdy and fairly bulletproof A good product 
Outstanding alternative cooking device 
This is a very good product for the price And a handy compact stove for anything 
I bought this liitle pump to blow up our rectangular pool It filled it up within 2025 minutes pretty fast for a little pump but be aware it IS NOISY YES IT IS The thing is as loud as a leaf blower if not louder I am sure my neighbors now hate my guts I actually took it inside to kind of minimize the noise level I do not think you really need ear plugs and such but if you have low tolerance for noise THIS IS NOT for you Otherwise it worked great for me 
I bought this to blow up my daughters Jumpolene What a disaster She was so happy when we opened the JumpOlene box and laid it out only to be disappointed when the Coleman air pump would not even turn on Now we have to wait until another electric air pump can arrive Not what you expect from Coleman nor Amazon 
Great product but in my opinion the most important part are the stakes When removing them from the ground the plastic breaks Also the puller doesnt work very well unless you are staking your tent in sand maybe Please COLEMAN make your stakes out of one solid pieve of metal that makes a loop at the top That would hold the lines and never break I knew the plastic would break as they always do but the stakes still work well and its a great kit to have and the dustpan and mini broom are a must have for any tent user This little tool can prevent holes in your floor in the future The mallet also works very well I would certainly make this purchase again 
Nice little set seems solid and a lot better then the tiny steaks that came with the tent 
great price excellent quality 
What can I say I loose tent pegs all the time These extra ones with a storage bag are great I keep all my pegs there now 
Works and fit good  
It looks good Should work fine They always have Amazon was awesome in exchanging the dented lantern I am very pleased with purchasing thru Amazoncom 
Very good product just what I expected 
Usually Coleman products are poorly made disposable items that break on the first trip This lantern reflector actually holds up and reflects at least some light 
I always wanted one of these and finally got one It works It is better for blocking light on one side than reflecting but that is exactly what I needed It fits most of my Colemen lanterns It does not fit my new Kerosene model but it does fit the older Kerosene model If your lantern has a nut on top in the center this will work 
Works very welljust like all Coleman timetested products The ONLY problem I found is that when installed on the lantern the fastener through the reflector can impact the lanterns glass globe if the hard shell is impacted on that side where the reflector is located 

Heavier than anticipated and too bulky for backpacking but works like a charm Since I need a cookingheat source for my car emergency kit I am keeping it Weight isnt a big issue while riding in my car trunk 
Great backup stove or as an additional stove Especially good for heating water or pots of soup or vegetables 
I bought this for my daughter but Ive had one for years and really like it Big enough to cook with and small enough to carry 
Love it 
I had dreamed of finding something like this and very glad to have it now 
Works great 
works great doesnt use as much propane as i thought and it got here quick 
It works quickly well designed The one thing they really could have done better is design a strap onto each one of the bits so you dont have to worry about them getting lost 
Received as gift The Battery makes it very heavy That only makes it win proof from not tipping over Would not buy it My GE Lantern uses rechargeable batteries Ds Better for night hikes This is too heavy for night hikes 
The stakes are certainly higher quality than those that came with my tent but the plastic tops have already shown some weakness in the first week I spent using them the color of the plastic getting lighter where its been stressed The metal stake puller bent a bit while pulling a stake out of some particularly grabby soil A small chunk of the mallet fell off while hammering in a stake I havent used the broom and dustpan yet The bristles get messed up in the mesh bag the kit came in 
Gift for a person that is new to camping 
Perfect for all the misc tent problems 
Highly functional 
Nice accessory for night fishing With this in place it is much easier to see a bobber in the water without being blinded by light and losing your night vision 
Great Item 
Gave to my husband as a gift and he is very pleased with it 
I dont notice it providing more light in the desired direction This thing is basically only useful as a way of blocking the light from shining on one side which is nice to have sometimes at the campsite 
Nice for car camping 
Good product and fast service 
Oh Im Jay this was awesome so small but yet as a road trip I got to cook my own food no matter where I went it was great I took a road trip from New York to Florida and back I save so much money with this little stove 
Perfect size and use for something that could save your life 
bought to heat morning coffee  it does it job quickly and efficiently bought refills at local store 2 packs less than one sold individual 
Excellent Unit 
Works well to direct and maximize the light from my Coleman Northstar Will fit in the case with the lantern although it take you a while to figure out how that can work NIce to be able to direct light away from neighbors and concentrate the light where needed 
very nice addition to any gas lantern to help keep the Light under control from any direction this mounts with a thumb screw thats easy to adjust and swivels with ease 
works as advertised good product 
good product 
One of those things in life that is just easier to buy and not try to make yourself Straightforward thumbscrews allow multiple adjustments and the shadereflector is perfectly curved to the glass Stores in lantern box while still on the lantern which is nice 
well worth the purchase 
Very Useful 
I love how quick it is to use this stove it lights easily and gets very hot The pans tend to slide off if the stove is not level thats the only area for improvement that I can see 
cooks fast and 1 tank lasted me 3 days with lots of cooking and hand warming use in 18 degree weather 
Works perfectly love it for camping Its bulky so I wouldnt recommend it for extended backpacking trips where weight is a big concern 
great for the emergency tube for the truck 
prefect 
Works great Compared to a couple other single burner stoves on last elk hunting trip this burned hottest percolating coffee before any of the others Great little stove for the price 
Very good 
very pleased 
Fits and serves its purpose Adjustable and no problems 
My family has had this lantern reflector in my family for 40 or so years and it still works as good as the first day my grandpa picked it up he has told me every hunting season It gets hot be careful 
Helps but not super reflective Try tin foil over it to get more punch Shoe goo will stick it on and be removeable 
This is a must have to get maximum directional efficiency from your lanternonly directing light to where its needed and not blinding others in your camp 
its kind of junky 
perfect 
Does its job perfectly 
This is a great pump dont get me wrong but man if it were a bit noisier you will get a visit from a neighbor or even a visit from the police for killing pigs in your house without proper permits I think even a blower is less irritating because it has a lower pitch while this tiny pump screams on a very high note But it performs great filling a three ring 9 gal children pool in about 10 minutes with little effort It does what is supposed to do and with great efficiency So if you can stand the horrible high pitch noise and find funny seeing you two years old daughter running away like a mad bunny onto her mothers arms while you stay there and fill her pool with your ears in pain and move well into an old age hearing loss problem this Is the pump for you If you cant stand an irritating high pitch noise or have nowhere to hide while this pump works then shop around for a quieter model if such thing exists 
good 
Use it for my tent and gazebos Works well 
Good value for the set Its very compact this is not a full size broom or mallet but it is perfect for the tent without taking up a ton of space We were able to fit it right into the tent bag to boot since is wasnt too big Loved it 
So convenient to have All campers should have this 
Well it was nice while it lasted and it was hilarious on the third swing when the mallet snapped and went flying poorly built complete waste of my money 
the mallet broke upon first use  everything was good 
I bought this to upgrade my tent stakes as well as for the stake puller I just used this kit for the first time on a recent camping trip I was impressed by the stakes and stake puller Both were invaluable The stakes are easy to hammer into the ground with the flat nail like head The mallet failed horribly I had hammered 3 out of 4 stakes successfully As I was hammering the last one in the mallet head came completely off the handle I saw that it had only been glued onto the handle I was disappointed Thankfully I had already staked my tent because I didnt bring a backup hammer or mallet The hand broom worked great for cleaning my tent floor And the stake puller worked perfectly when it was time to leave 
Awesome Item Thanks 
Works great Adjustable height makes it easy to swap between my single mantle and double mantle lanterns 
perfect for when your hanging your lantern from a tree 
The reflector fits and works great I recommend it 
It works Too bad its made in China 
I was really skeptical that something like this would be in any way stable I expected it to be topheavy and prone to tipping over Surprisingly it is not It is very safe and stable It heats up VERY fast and is very handy The flame is blue and can be hard to see if you dont have a pan on it The first time I used it I didnt think it was lit until I put a pan on and could see the blue flame We use this for all kinds of camping Even if we are making camp fires something like this is nice for breakfast when you just want to cook a couple eggs and dont want to make a big fire or start a charcoal grill It is also pretty fuel efficient The fuel is affordable and you get quite a bit of cooking time out of it Very affordable as well 
These things cook beautifully From low to high heat the performance is impressive One lb tank lasts a very long time too Get one today 
If you are camping you will definitely need this product Th mallet is very easy to use and the tent pegs are very good they keep my tent secure I also love the broom and the dustpan it can keep my coleman tent clean HIGHLY RECOMMEND 
Highly recommend for tent camping The stakes hold excellently in a storm  10x better than the simple ones that come with every tent You wont know how much you need the brush until you pack up to head home 
good 
This is a nice set but the quality is mixed First the 4 big tent stakes are what I wanted the least when I bought the kit but they turned out to be the best thing about it I was camping in the Rockies recently and had to set up my tent on very hard ground and these were the best stakes for the job I couldnt even get the little metal stakes that came with my tent to go into the ground and the larger yellow plastic stakes got all bent up I wound up going out and buying a dozen more of these big stakes which are basically nails with green hooks on top The green hooks are kinda flimsy unfortunately The mallet is nice for pounding in the small metal or plastic stakes but pounding the big metal stakes into hard ground did leave some scars in the mallets rubber head Itd be nice if one side of it had a metal cap or something The stakepuller is basically too weak to pull out any stakes that you cant just pull by hand although its nice to use so you dont strain your hands Its completely worthless for pulling stakes from hard ground and will just bend until its wrecked Im going to buy a small crowbar instead The dustpan is pretty flimsy Mine immediately cracked along its edge if I didnt receive it that way Its also pretty difficult to put back in the bag All in all its a cheap set but youre basically just getting a decent mallet 4 good stakes and an occasionallyconvenient stake puller Oh and the bag is pretty good 
Worked well and the tools that came with it are perfect I just wish it came with more than 4 stakes since I needed 8 for my tent and rainfly 
Handy little kit for camping 
This shades the area behind it for use when walking or any other time you would want to shade your lantern The downside is even though it is called a reflector it doesnt reflect anything its a brushed aluminum surface and is not reflective That will be the last time I will trust Coleman in the future if its from Coleman I want to open the box and inspect it before I will pay a dime for it I temporarily fixed Colemans inept and no doubt overseas manufacturing process with some aluminum foil Reynolds seems to still be able to get their aluminum to shine whats up with that Coleman and duct tape what I should have just used to begin with When I got back home I stripped off the aluminum foil and duct tape and polished it to a mirror shine with a dremel tool Glad I the paying customer buying their crap could fix their overpriced flawed product for them 
Its of good quality and it came on time shipping was great 
I like this because it blocks the worst glare from your lantern rather than for its reflective properties Worth about three bucks 
These fit my lamps perfect I used to use foil and and it worked but these work much better They are simple and easy to put on and take off 
Good product 
very good 
Excellent quality Very good material 
worked great to boil stuff and fast during a recent power outage 
A 
Husband took it hunting  worked well This also doubles as our disaster prep stove 
We have used this lantern for several months while running our food coop We have absolutely loved it It is heavy enough that it doesnt blow away but I can see that being an issue for someone who wanted to carry it around Overall a great buy 
If you grew up with the inconvenience of using messy white gas stoves and lanterns for camping youll love this flourescent bulb lantern for its instant on and off We use this for RVing and camping in summer We keep in the house in case of power outages Its well worth the price that those cheap LED lanterns which only glow and emit little light It recharges for easy use and keeps a charge for days of moderate use The retro look brings back fond memories of camping as a kid 
Excellent quality easy to open and fold up and a fantastic waterproof picnic blanket I tried it on as a poncho and it was incredibly comfortable I will buy some more for gifts and one more for myself to keep at the house 
Cheap quality 
Great multipurpose blanket we use it mostly for our son to eat pizza on the family room floor when we have movie night 
Good for soccer moms and dads Much more windproof than regular blanket and repels most moisture Good to keep in truck for unexpected cold or windy days on the sideline Covers two people if you sit close Worth buying if you go to a lot of games or picnics 
As others have posted I think this does more to keep the lantern from shining away from the camp towards the neighbors than it actually improves the lumens 
I have three lanterns and I have installed these on them all It directs the light where you want it Go campers 
works very good would buy again if it breaks again easy to attached to lantern I would buy another thank you 
This is a great add on to the lantern Prevents light from bleeding into neighbors camps or from blinding you while taking a nighttime stroll to the bathroom It does add some bulk to the lanternif my case wasnt already too big Im not sure it would fit 
I used to use tin foil so the light would not blind you but this is great Attachess to the screw on top and is adjustable It even fits into the plastic lantern box 
Puts more light where you want it and NONE where you dont Should be included with the brighter lanterns to avoid angering your neighbors 
I have owned my two Coleman lanterns for 25 years and have always hated being blinded by the light Wrapped up like a duece when Im running in the night This reflector fits under the top bolt and is fully adjustable for many models It actually blocks the light in the back more than reflecting light out 
very light duty 
Campers must have Finally gave this a test run on a recent camping trip and I dont know why I had gone so long without having this kit The stakes are VERY sturdy much better quality than the ones I got with my tent The mallet and the stake remover did their jobs perfectly The broom and dust pan were great for sweeping up the inside of the tent before packing All of these fit into a compact mesh bag that doesnt take up a lot of space when full The stakes come with a removable rubber cap on their pointed tips I suggest putting these caps back on before storing the stakes in the mesh bag so that you dont tear anything 
Does what it says but blocks more light to the rear than it reflects forward Probably wont use much unless im in a camp site that is close to others and staying up late 
It fits on easily and blocks the light from going to 13 of the circumference But this is more of a light blocker and should be advertised as so than a reflector I wish it had a mirrored polished surface instead of the dull metal finish it comes with Might try to polish itMinus one star for dull surface 
I guess the must seems a bit demanding Sorry if I offend We use the reflector for two reasons 1 to eliminate light pollution into the next campsite to be courteous campers and 2 to shield the tree from which the lantern might be hanging from excessive heat reducing damage to the tree We never drive a nail into any tree but if one is present where we want to hang a lantern we will use it Mostly however we use thenbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefColemanLanternHangerdpB0009PUTJIrefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTF8Coleman Lantern Hangera and this reflector which fits into the lantern case without having to remove it from the lantern 
There have always been a couple of these in the family theyre great When not available  aluminum foil on one side of the globe works well also Now when your lantern is faced toward your fishing gear youre not blinded Weve also made them from coffee cans and Lbrackets 
Handy I have used this for camping picnicking you name it 
I was great until I needed the rain protections and never got it back like original packing Ended up just stuffing it in 
Really puts out the heat This stove is great I use it mainly for making coffee when Im camping Its small and portable and is really sturdy I used it to reheat a large pot of chili 12 inch dutch over and it held it without any issues It looked a little precarious but it didnt fail I was more worried that I didnt have it on evenly and the whole thing would fall over The one knock on it is that the preset clicks on the dial make it a little difficult to set to low It is best for cranking out the heat not likely simmering something I still love it though 
This heats stuff up really fast Looks like it will last a long time The base is a nice extra for stabilty 
Works greatsuper simpleOnly thing that would make it perfect if it came with some type of case 
The valve to turn off and on sucks cant tell if on or off no click to let you know the rest is well built  but the valve has something wrong 
Great little heater Well built  easily portable Stable when set up Works very well 
Its a pretty simple design with one big flaw it doesnt fit in the hard case that came with my Coleman 285A lantern without disassembling it Granted disassembly is fast but it would have been easy to design this to fit inside a Coleman hard case I think with a little bending I may be able to get it so it doesnt have to come apart every time its packed up I like it because it blocks light from other campers who dont want the bright light from a lantern My girlfriend likes it because she can adjust the reflector so the bright light isnt shining on her while we play cards at night Its a worthwhile purchase but its one of those things that if it broke or was left at home you wouldnt miss it much 
I have two of these I use when night fishing on my Coleman lanterns they work very well keeping the brightens out of your eyes and shining straight ahead You want be sorry you brought it 
looks kinda cheesy works great set it up in backyard and blocked light from keeping neighbors up 
Not much to this reflector really But it is made of aluminum works is adjustable and inexpensive Keep the product box for convenient storage unless like me you have a permanent lantern setup on the lanai pool or back deck Please note that since Coleman has decided to offshore American jobs this reflector is prominently marked Made in China and lacks the convenient handle of vintage Americanmade items However it still works BONUS FEATURE The reflector will accommodate Big Hat Colemans such as the 228  but i dont think id use this on a 226 or 229 Also like others have pointed out this is more of a directional shade rather than a reflector  but useful when fishing or in my case to create ambient lighting I count this Coleman accessory right up there with other goodies for my Coleman lanterns such as a hardshell case or a Jafe Decorating tinted or frosted globe 
Works ok and is cheap enough Adjusts to fit all lanterns I have tried it on singles and doubles modern and old I think it actually works better as a shade than as a reflector the metal finish is more matte than reflective It definitely stops light from shining behind the reflector but I am less sure that much light is actually reflected forward Good for keeping light and heat pointed in the direction you prefer 
I bought this item months ago but never used it till last weekend It worked perfectly as designed blocking all light in its direction You can easily concentrate your light source where you want it and especially away from where you dont want it It doesnt Reflect the light back and make the opposite side brighter but rather just stops light from passing through This reflector allowed to me set my boundaries on each side of my fishing spot without blinding my neighboring fishermen Also it fits perfectly inside the Red Coleman carrying case without a problem Im going to buy a 2nd and 3rd for my other two lanterns 
This is another well made Coleman product and it performs as advertised When disassembled which takes less than a minute it easily fits in the case with my lantern While Im not convinced that the reflector adds much more light in the direction it is aimed the best aspect is that it totally blocks light behind it No light is thrown on the neighbors camps and you arent blinded when carrying it or working with it or playing games If you have a lantern you should give this reflector a try Youll wonder what you ever did without it 
This is a very strange blanket Where the poncho hole is it fits oddly and therefore doesnt make for a great blanket Would not recommend or buy again 
Bought for football games Warm and water resistant I like it Easy to pack in my tote 
I ordered one since it sounded like a clever thing to have in an emergency on the road Having got my hands on it I an most impressed especially at the price I have just ordered one for lady in my life Opened up at the sides  as if to spread it out flat  if the front leafside is wrapped backwards around the waist and then the back leafside is wrapped over that and held with a bungee or whathaveyou a very warm garment results At first I thought that the attached pouchwithahandle it comes packed in was almost well thought out as a hood when used as a poncho Then I found the draw cord sewn into it and it all came together If one is dressed reasonably for the weatherseason and is caught outdoors this would be perfect as a substantial added layer if one had to be out in it for a while by surprise No I would not use this for expedition wear 
Works great and it easy to carry 
ok 
Powerful little burner You just insert the bottle in the base and press down firmly to seat it in place turn the switch and then light it with a match or lighter Poof You have a portable burner that is more powerful than most ranges It does produce carbon Monoxide so it should really be used outdoors Crack a window close by if you must use it indoors but that is not recommended Just wait till the power goes out during a snow storm and you cannot make any hot coffee You will be glad that you purchased this little gem Boiling water is just the beginning Buy some Folgers instant and some minimoos and you will be all set for the next big storm 
Amazing how this thing works We have a portable grill and a gas lantern from Coleman So we had those propanetanks from them already This burner is a little bigger and not good for backpacking because of its size But when you go camping with a car you can fit it and it is a must have Boils water in no time and you can cook like how your used at home When you put it on an even surface it is pretty solid 
like it add a can of propane turn on can turn up or down 
Functions well Control knob has quite a bit of play in it when closed I think that is normal for this model I do wish that the play was not there 
Nice simple burner Just what I hoped for 
This is great Comes in so handy even when Im not camping 
I didnt think Id use every piece in this kit a few weeks ago on my camping trip but I did Highly recommended 

PROS Very sturdy under the light pan that we use while camping It sits pretty flat on the propane tank so liquid doesnt collect on one side of the pan It works quickly to heat our cooking gear Pretty small easy to pack and carry CONS The gas knob is very sensitive On its lowest couple of settings the little amount of gas let out if any wont light with a lighter On medium settings it goes from no flame to a pretty hot flame making it hard to cook properly It ends up being more of an onoff switch than an adjustable knob Overall its a good stove for those who dont feel the need to eat gourmet food while camping 
Great little stove perfect for camping sturdy heats quickly Not as small as some backpacking stoves you see but for the price simplicity and its abilities definitely a good purchase 
work great convinient 
Beware this stove is NOT COMPACT I thought this would be cool for camping maybe back packing I took it backpacking once and realize how huge it really is I only use it for camping at a campground now I like that it functions easily and nicely though If you have a campground this is great for bringing your pots and pans and cooking whatever you want The propane tanks are pretty cheap and last a long time too The stove seems pretty high quality and can put out a lot of heat 
Works like a charm Love having hot coffee at the campsite Couldnt be simpler to use puts out plenty of heat packs down small seems relatively sturdy Wouldnt car camp without it 
Was the perfect burner for my over night camping trip on my motorcycle Easily packed away in a small space Easy to screw on to the propane tank Lights quickly and has a graduated adjustment knob for high medium and low flame Small pan or coffee pot fits perfectly on top Base is solid and wide enough that it is not top heavy 
It works like its supposed to 
Great quality and it works very well Love it 
So easy to use Lights instantly and simmers easily Boils quickly Yeah its heavy and bulky but for my 53 yearold knees it is so much easier to use than my MSR without bending so far down so it is worth the extra weight 
Easy to keep up with and works very well 
plastic tops pulled off stakes first use And rubber head flung off mallet Can you make it ANY cheaper 
Great blankettarp to keep in my car It comes in handy for all sorts of things 
it does its job but feels cheap I suppose you get what you pay for but its not all that easy to pack back in I would say it is ok to keep the grass off yabut I would not recommend to a friend 
This is a nice backup for cooking in bad weather No problems 
Very good 
you gotta have one 
Its a perfect kit  nothing else is needed We experienced a hail storm lots of rain and wind  an the stakes worked perfectly through that horrible weather 
A must have for camping Nice package 
great product good delivery 
Very small kit Very small 
Great Lantern for power outages and especially campingIt is pretty heavy so my idea of hanging it from the center of my tent isnt possible Ill get a lightweight solar lamp for hanging But for everything else this is perfect 
This was a good lantern for our camping trips last summer but fast forward 5 months and pull it out of the closet to charge up in preparation for those winter storms  dead Well the nightlight worked for a while  but it wont charge at all I borrowed a charger from a friend to see if that was the fault but that did not solve the problem Looking at the reviews here and on Colemans website it seems this is a common problem where the lantern has not been used for an extended period This is the second rechargeable Coleman product that has failed in less than 24 months of ownership Disappointing  heed the warnings here  you might just be buying a disposable lantern 
I looked all over for a family size picnic blanket and this was the best value I found I love that it is also a poncho and a seat cushion Less stuff I have to pack in the car My family of 5 can rest comfortably on this 
Not much to say it makes fire and I have a lot of green Coleman cans lying around Figured I would throw it in with the emergency supplies just in case we need to cook some meals if the power and gas goes out Solid not like the light weight back packing stoves Only con that I could thing of is the height this thing is pretty tall once it is all set up and cooking Watch the kids around this 
Too big for backpacking in the woods although works great as an outdoor stove 
This burner worked great It did will in the rain and handled a moderate breeze The base provides good balance and the flame controls worked well It does NOT have a piezo ignition so it does require matches to light Cons  Larger and more awkward than I expected It does not pack that well and it is too large to be suitable for backpacking This is great for car camping  The spacing of the pot supports is wide so small items like cans or coffee cups will not sit on the burning You would need another grill to lay above the flame to support these items 
Perfect for camping 
Good for the survivalist 
3in1 doesnt do any one great I carry this on my touring bike to go camping with It is pretty comfortable to lay this on my thermarest under my sleeping bag But for that purpose it doesnt really need to be this big When I first opened it I tried out the poncho and cant imagine using it as a poncho in real life So it is a blanket a poncho and I cant even remember the third use anymore Ill use it for now but when it wears out Ill try something else UPDATE I was complaining about it being too big but might have been too critical This past summer I was camping and the temperature dipped 10 degrees lower than expected I used the loops and hooks to wrap it around my sleeping bag Kind of like a burrito Thanks to its size I stayed warm enough to be comfortable that night 
I keep it in my car for emergencies and for taking into cold movie theaters and sporting events it is well made and folds into a pouch for neat storage 
Definitely works as advertised Warm and easy to carry I keep it in my trunk as an emergency blanket as well as for impromptu picnics For the price it cant be beat Much larger and cheaper than leading competitors 
This blanket works great as a cover over hard stadium seats It can also serve as a picnic blanket but I prefer something thats more heavy duty Ive had no issues folding this I received a red one 
Good collection value for money 
The mallet is great but I was a bit disappointed in the stakes One of them bent while we were pulling it out They also have plastic caps on top of them that you use when pulling the stakes back out of the groundthey bend and we even had one break The bag is a bit small so you have to take everything out to rearrange it and put it back in when you get it out However I gave the product three stars because of the mallet and it is better than the alternative regular tent stakes and a hammer 
The rubber mallet is DEFINITELY from China Super strongnoxious odors are giving headaches even after venting in the garage for a month I have to throw it in a tied bag when putting it in the car The stakes are great though The bag is super tight and if you try to store the broom in it it will get the bristles caughtbent when putting it in or removing it 
Really compact and easy to swap out tanks with If you cant build a fire this will fill the bill nicely 
Definitely a must have for any lazy camper I have mine just in case the stove top is a nice solid piece 
I was really hoping to give this a good review because I love Coleman but the stove is small heavy not easy to compact carry and it leaks like crazy Even at absolute off the stove will still leak a small but steady flame if there is no wind I blame it on the design of the knob being so easily exposed and fairly cheaply made The rest of the stove could hold a damn picnic table but the control knob is super cheap plastic in the wrong place I have only taken this camping once did not abuse it and it was brand new About the 3rd time I used it I noticed the gas leak This seems like a great idea as a backup stayathome just in case type stove but it is not light enough for hiking and it leaks so bad that you wouldnt think to leave on your propane tank ever That said it is a good working stove that can make a single propane tank last quite a while 
Thick metal construction and ample size can handle the heaviest pots Only downside is the variable gas valve has only three useful levels without the option to choose anything in between as it stepsjumps as it turns There is no good low setting to keep things just warm 
I bought this lamp based on reviews of others There were other models that I looked at but I went with this one because many people said the light was bright and that is what I wanted When I received it and I charged it for one day I tested it out and the high setting and low setting seem to put out the same amount of light and in my opinion it wasnt that bright I may have been expecting something more but it is bright enough for you to see and to do things without having to use one hand to hold a flashlight I havent tested out how long it truly last and it is a bit heavy because of the battery 
Ive been using this stove for about a year now Its a heavy wellmade burner best suited for car camping where size and weight are not big concerns A major advantage of this burner is the low cost and wide availability of the 16 oz propane canisters that power it You get far more bang for your fuel buck with this stove as compared to stoves using the smaller isobutane canisters At my local big box store a 16 oz propane canister costs about 250 whereas an 8 oz isobutane fuel canister costs 5 Twice the fuel for half the cost is never a bad thing Propane canisters also last a long time and are widely available Lighting this burner is easy Simply turn the knob to release the gas and provide a spark manually and youre cooking The simplicity of this burner also has advantages in reliability As for cooking performance this stove excels at boiling water and tasks that require a high flame The major flaw is that this stove doesnt have a setting that I would describe as truly low If youre cooking foods that are prone to sticking or burning on thin camping cookware you will find that this stove burns too hot even on the lowest setting A couple times Ive made pancakes on camping trips and I had to hold my pan above the stove to avoid burning even on low It hasnt been a problem on most foods but the lack of a very low setting can be troublesome Id recommend checking out the Stansport burner here on Amazon or the Ozark Trail brand burner sold at Walmart I believe both will do a better job cooking at low temp Other than that this is an inexpensive reliable and wellmade burner that works great If simmering or lowflame performance is a concern for you I would pass on this stove 
Great product 
just used it on a week long camping trip loved it 
I used this for my first time camping trip It was very simple to put together and it lit on the very first tryalso has a nice stable base its easy to adjust the flame I solo camp so just want a basic cook burner for weekend tent camping It would be great for backpacking or for power outage I love it 
seems finetho i should have checked the measurementsmuch bigger than i wantedbut i wont deduct stars for itcuz twas my own lack of observation 
We bought this mostly because of the stakes which are much better than the ones which came with our tent Dropped a star due to the stake puller which is somewhat flimsy 
GREAT FOR TENT CAMPING 
This was a good product I didnt give it 5 stars because the first time we pull out the hammer it falls apart  everything else tho was great 
excellent for cleaning up our tent after camping It always bothers me how dirty our tent gets even though we take our shoes off outside This is a perfect solution 
It has everything you need to stake a tent down Worked well for my 2 person tent 
good 
I have had dozens of different camping lanterns from liquid gas to propane to battery powered but never one like this rechargeable lantern The night light function is great when you need a little light around the room or tent but dont want to destroy your night vision The two level light selection is also great when you are nursing the battery life for all it is worth out where there is no electricity to hook up to I bought one tried it for about six months and came back for a second one based on my experience with the first If you live where power outages are fairly common camp in the wilderness or live off the power grid this is the lantern to beat all lanterns My power generator ran out of fuel during a big dinner celebration and we grabbed our lanterns a few candles and the party continued Buy a couple of these for your RV or camping trailer you wont regret it 
I love that this lantern can be plugged into a wall socket and if the power goes off it will come on provided you have the switch to the high or low position You can test it to make sure it is working by plugging it in turning the switch to the high position and then unplugging it when plugged in it should be turned off and when unplugged it should turn on automotically the advantages of this turning on automatically are manymostly though if it is completely dark and the outage was unexpected you automatically have a light for safety to move about to look for other emergency supplies This is a very heavy lantern so i cant imagine taking it backpacking Although I could see the great benefit to having it camping If the battery dies you can recarge it with the included car charger stored in base of unit I am very satisfied with this purchase and wouldnt hesitate to buy it again 
This is my 2nd coleman 3n1 blanket after losing the 1st one I use it as a pillow blanket seat pad or to throw at my dog it works great for all four 
I took it on a walk in the rain with my buddy my entire upper body and arms were completely dry The material is genius and a solid product Its great that it also can just be bundled up into a bag and used as a pillow Its very warm on the interior so you will stay toast in the windy weathers A Product hell yeah 
I bought three of these for the flag football seasondont get me wrong we absolutely love the concept of the 3 in 1 features BUT not being able to select your colors is absolutely hokey We ordered 3 and got 1 red 1 blue 1 greenthere is no one here to fault because it is spelled out that Colors May Vary but it is a shame that we could not get 3 red as they are my sons football teams colors These are great to throw in the back of the SUV and are great for all occasions My only suggestionLET US PICK THE COLORS 
Great stove great price  FAST SHIPPING 
This thing is awesome I would highly recommend this to anyone who camps or backpacks as well as anyone who just really likes to heat up pots and pans outside to each their own 
I rated this down because of its large size It is really too big for back packing For car camping a 2 burner stove is more practical and does a much better in wind I have not really found a use for this stove 
It works and is a quality build But it is otherwise inelegant With some clever thinking the burner and stand could have been designed to nestle and store together The onoffvolume knob doesnt have a good feel and is too easily turned off when trying to just adjust the flame Its an OK product but nothing you will be overly proud of 
Great little burner It heated our cast iron skillet in no time and used very little fuel Very impressed 
Great compact grill Will use this for making coffee and tea as well as anything in a pan Its compact and light weight enough to take on a long hike 
I was skeptical of this lantern at first as I always camped with fuel lanterns all my life With a 3 and 4 year old running around a camp site I had second thoughts about propane or kerosene light sources I just used this on a weekend camping trip and it performed wonderfully and I didnt worry if the kids got too close to it Once the bulb warms up fully it is a very bright lantern We kept the night light on all night with no problem The charge lasted a little longer than stated when I was putting it through a couple of charge cycles before our trip Since its a leadacid battery I dont worry about battery memory so I would plug it in in the morning to charge during the day and use at night So far Im very happy with this product Battery is warranted for 5 years time will tell 71311  Two yers later and still running like a champ It has been hanging in the garage without being plugged in for about 6 months and the power went off a couple of nights ago It ran for two nights on what juice it had approx 4 hours total with no issues and still had power when the electric came back Im sorry that other customers seem to be getting lemons but mine has been flawless 
I wish I had this lantern years ago Since I puchased it it has come in handy 3 times in power outs I leave it plugged in and when the power goes out the lantern comes on and lights up the whole room No more stubbed toes Ouch 
Its good The spikes hold up really well much better than the ones that come with tents The mallet is ok The brush is kind of worthless The spikes are the best part of the kit 
Easy to use and everything in one bag for easy storage 
Kit arrived quickly and contained all of the described items No complaints good product 
BOUGHT THIS JUST BEFORE MY BIG 2 WEEK CAMPING TRIP NICE LITTLE KIT TO HAVE OF COURSE MY TENT REQUIRES MORE STAKES SO I TOOK OUT THE HAMMER TO STORE ALL THE STAKES IN THE BAG 
This is a greatest thing that I ever bought we had coffee all the time while camping 
I reviewed all of the other dual burning stoves I just didnt want to spend the money Now that i have this i probably wont be getting a dual burner stove This is all i need 
You cant beat this little stove for convenience The flame gets VERY HOT and will boil water quickly Great for power outages when you dont want to grill Nice for a picnic when you want something heated up 
All i have to say is wow this stove was better than expected Only thing wrong is the knob for the gas release A little flimsy but other than that this was perfect for camping 
This is the second lantern that has failed The first would not hold a charge The second one died after 20 minutes If you are thinking about buying this one do a search on Amazon and see the other Retro listing same product with negative reviews Very very disappointed Update The third lantern has lasted for years I do not leave it plugged in as I did the other two I turn it on for 9 hours once a month and then recharge for 1216 hours It has worked fine doing this maintenance Five and half year update I still have the third lantern and continue to perform the maintenance as described in my update above Just now there seems to be a problem with either the battery or the bulbbut it has served me well Going to upgrade rating to three stars 
This is the second one and it too has failed Coleman was very nice in replacing the first one after it would not recharge Now the electricity went out and it worked for 20 minutes and quit And when it did work there was little difference between high and low settingif it mattered I notice there is another Retro Lantern on Amazon which looks the same but has high ratings I strongly advise to research this model and think twice before buying Now I have to look for one that works 
I recommend this kit for anyone with a tent whether it be purchased new or you have ol trusty The stakes are appropriately 8 and very durable The rubber mallet is light weight and drive the stakes without hesitation The broom and dust pan were small and seemingly useless  I think their best use is for a doll house 
Handy and helpful 
so 
Looks smaller than in the pics other than that your good to go 
This is cheap garbage everything fell apart and broke The mallet head comes off and whips around its very very dangerous The stake remover broke after 1 use The little broom and dustpan are so cheap The stakes arent bad though Honestly you get what you pay for 
Bought this for a camping trip to make sure tents were secure The mallet did not last 2 mins the black piece fell off and was unusable Maybe I can fix it but what a waste 
For basic heating in the middle of nowhere this is a simple and as good as it gets I like simple You need a lighter but once lit this thing works so well and puts out a lot of heat 
Works like it should heats water quickly Great for camping It doesnt seem to use gas very fast as well 
Bought this as prime and the delivery was very fast I was surprised when I opened the box and found it was not in new condition thats why didnt give it five stars It obviously has been used before from the burn marks on the orifice and the pot rests Seems to work so I guess Ill keep it Some folks complain about not having a propane tank included Read the description It clearly states you need to buy the propane separately 
I love this stove Ive had mine four years now and it still works like new I recently loaned it to a friend who says he is now going to buy one so I thought Id see if Amazon still carries it and I read some reviews I was shocked by some of the critical comments I read This stove heats water very quickly even at high altitudes though water will not heat as quickly at 10000 feet as it will at sea level with any stove Compared to a white gas stove or a Jetboil this stove does heat slightly more slowly but the difference is negligible and not worth the 100 difference in price and putting up with the delicate craftsmanship of the others This Coleman is solid and durable The head has many small holes or jets for the flame to ensure a regular evenlydistributed level adjustable with clicks on the dial from high to very low simmering to off with a couple more stops in between The design of the burner shields the flame from any wind so in all but the most windy conditions it works fine without any additional shielding Mine simmers perfectly with a very small flame Some reviewers here complained that the simmer is too strong so they may have a defective unit If I were to design a stove I would design the flame control as utilitarian as this one is The burner easily separates from the tank and base to split up the load for hiking The tanks can be found for just a few dollars and Coleman claims a tank will last for more than two hours on high or nine hours on low which is plenty to cook many meals and heat water for cleanup Ive used it to prepare all meals for a threeday backpacking trip for six people at 9000 feet and I didnt use up a single tank I suggest starting with a full tank or two depending on length of trip backpacking and keeping partial tanks to use on camping trips where having extra tanks is not an issue For the price this is a steal Its a very good stove for backpacking and for camping though a little heavy for the hiker Not a problem for a group however to distribute the load Remember when youre a couple days in at 10000 feet you want a good reliable and durable stove like this  and not a finicky white gas or specialcanister overpriced butane stove 
Second one I have purchased for work in 2 years I am not the one using it but it seems to fit our needs perfectly for a grass volleyball net for elementary 56 grade volleyball teams I would purchase again 
This volleyball net is great high quality and easy to set up 
Pretty good 

with 27 glowing reviews i ordered this blanket with confidence i should have read the few bad reviews a little closer it is a pain to fold up provides little warming as the blanket part is super thin and the poncho mode is giant and unwieldy its not defective so much as ineffective i was thinking backpack camping but now im thinking car trunk for emergency ONLY i definetly disagree with the camping tags oh well 
Bought this blanketponchostadium seatpillow  couldnt be happier Looked for a versatile item that the family could use camping football games etc Very well made as most Coleman items are havent washed it yetbut will probably follow another reviewers advice and not dry it in the dryer Contrary to other reviews its very easily converted back into pouch pillow form My ONLY complaint is that you cant choose a color Im looking forward to it raining next time I campI think wink BUY ONE BEFORE COLEMAN STOPS MAKING THEM 17 is a steal 
My Son  I each have had one for 34 years Great for camping with our scout troop I carry it as a pillow on fallspring backpacking trips too Its perfect as a poncho on a cool night around the campfire Great to sit on whatever Plus if you are not a mummy bag aficionadolike me it makes a great head coverblanket for the top half of your bag on a cold night You wont go wrong with these 
This is as advertised fleece on one side waterproof on the other Large center internal pocket when configured as a poncho Easy ties on the sides to keep it closed in poncho configuration As a poncho its fine in a pinch The hoods a little awkward but acceptable Ive had no trouble refolding it It comes with instructions but how this thing works though simple could be confusing because the pouch works best as a hood when its inside out Its good if you open it up and try it out when you dont need it and have a couple of minutes to see it work If you have any experience with other self storing clothing like travel jackets or raincoats this is similar Its washable I keep one in the car to wear if needed and to use to protect the upholstery or deck if I haul something like mulch bags This is a great value well made Only complaint is theres no choice in color 
I do not see the need for an indepth review of something so simple You can adjust the rate at which the propane flows if you are cooking with this but brings water to boil at the same rate as any other similiar stove This stove does look nice and shiny when it is new and will discolor with heat If that is an issue to you then I really have no suggestions to help you other than stay in the city Wind can be a bit of an issue if it gets too strong so if you are expecting some you may want to find a way to rig up a wind shield to make this more efficient but I have had no major issues with this and understood wind would be a possible issue with a single burner like this The entire set up is study and have no worries of leaving a larger pot to boil As with anything else just be safe and use your common sense 
This is part of my Jeep survival kit and I used it the other day for the first time Boiled water in under 2 minutes 
Too bulky for backpacking but for car camping it is great Plenty of heat for low cost canister Not tippy 
Arrived very quickly and in perfectly new condition The burner is bigger than I thought it would be but that is more of a positive than anything the provided canister base is nice and wide tooshould be difficult to unintentionally knock over I will add a more in depth review to this post after I have time to get the propane and test the system in a few days Good Seller 
This thing puts out some serious heat Put three of them on the back patios table and you can cook to hearts content No storage issues with the 16oz propane cannisters 
It seems ok just not impressed that its made in CHINAaaa Wish these companies would start employing Americans who use there stuff I did return it and ordered I believe the Stansport brand from Amazon 
This blanket was easily the best purchase I have made recently Its versatility in going from blanket to poncho to picnic tarp is bar none best One side is soft fleece while the other is waterproof nylon Whether on the beach or on dewy grass theres no worries about water seeping through and ruining any potential romantic destinations As a camp blanket its light enough to take the place of a sleeping bag depending on conditions One can freely lay it across a pile of leaves which are dry on top but wet underneath Having praised this blanket its time to move on to the one and only con When wearing this blanket as a poncho the hard plastic velcro strips tend to poke right in the forehead or the corners will dig into the scalp The discomfort it can cause is sometimes unreal Also the hoodie that the blanket tucks into when stored makes for a slightly smaller and less openfaced opening than I would like For picnics I would recommend purchasing a small sized neet sheet to place the food on as there is simply not enough room for two people and food containers The choice is in your hands now may everything work out and you enjoy this item as much as I do 
Just as described comes in a handy pouch Good quality 
If you dont own a rubber mallet then this product is for you You buy it for the stakes and quite honestly they are sort of crappy for the money Pulling them out of fairly hard dirt with that hook resulted in two broken stakes The plastic tops just snapped off And the dust pan with broom A buck at the dollar store However the stakes are better than the ones that come with a Coleman tent 
Camp with confidence that you can stake a tent practically anywhere with this kit I use the mallet on every camping trip 
Good kit but Chinese mallet smells TERRIBLE Its been sitting on top of my AC fan outside for a month and still smells like Im gonna die if I get too close 
Keeps my tent clean 
Love the tent dust pan Great mallet stakes and convenient bag 
It is a wellmade lantern with a nice night light The only negative is that it is quite heavyabout 7 lb Thus this is not recommended for backpackers who count every ounce 
Does exactly what it says  came on time and as promised So far works fine 
Well built  heavy Actually it holds a curly type bulb not a ushaped tube giving off more light Storage in bottom for the 12volt car charger The builtin nite light is actually rather bright bright enough for leaving on in a tent while sleeping So far very satisfied with the purchase Years ago I used a Coleman propane light which ran very hot and unsafe to leave on in a tent while sleeping This makes more sense Ecofriendly Guess you can recharge it during the daytime off your car battery except it takes many hours Update 72008 We had our first 3 hour power outage last nite This lantern worked great Actually I found that running it on low was bright enough to find my way around the house Left it on the night light setting after returning to the bedroom Still bright enough to see in the bedroom yet sleep This lantern is excellent 
Both lamps have failed and I suspect the batteries Replacements are available on Amazon but this is old technology You are better off getting a 10 day lantern from Amazon for about 25 and using Eneloop AA batteries This gives you a smaller lighter rechargeable lamp with an LED light that will have a long shelf life between charges ie if kept for emergencies it will be ready and not self discharged Just read the reviews the overall quality of this Coleman lampmake it good for nothing I dont plan to spend any money fixing it Being retro doesnt do any good unless it works 

If you play real volleyball this is the best net you can get under 600 VERY VERY lightweight compared to the professional setups that require 2 people to carry This one weighs no more than a 4 person tent bag which is awesome I have 10 of these for our volleyball club and we use them for our tournaments with AA club level play and they hold up year after year Very very good nets for amazing price The bad  order a set of professional 2 boundary lines as the ones that come with it is just a thin string which you COULD use but its definitely not the way to go 
Excellent 
As winter sleeks away with spring rains thoughts of reading in parks and beaches burble forth There are tools required to make the action right Start with the Coleman blanket With wine or ice tea armed with Twain Cervantes Wharton or Bronte packing pens and notebooks there you have most of what you need Needed more and especially though is a blanket Bring at least the book and the blanket and you are geared and ready for reading Bring too your kindest friend or sweetest lover and find room enough for two for leisured reading and wine sipping Find a tree big enough for shade small enough to let light flicker through and unfurl the blanket Watch where the sun is going and position your blanket accordingly Let the shade follow you A bright glare on Huck Finn will not do him nor you any good The blanket is also a poncho and stadium seat cushion but properly folded or wrapped all blankets show the same versatility What matters is that under a budding tree in March through September on sunny mornings and overcast afternoons this blanket connects you with a friend and your book Brockeim 
This is a must for your power outage  It stores easy Vary handi for a pick nick also 4 stars well made 
It may have been my fault but the image led me to believe that it would come with the gas tank so I would have the hole set in case of emergency That is not the case So far I have not tried the product so I cant comment more 
Great for car camping or when the electricity goes out Doesnt take up a lot of space either Used it many times now If youre looking for a portable burner for backpacking this is not a good choicethere are lighter and less bulkier models out there 
I would recommend this kit with any tent  affordable and contains products necessary for easily setting up a tent 
Not good the quality control never check The wood handle has a crack But they replace it with a new one so im happy now Looks in good quality Very useful 
I Loved this stove works well I just wish it came with a case I will use this a lot 
i have a similar one and it is not as good as this one very happy with the stove unit 
Ive had one of these stoves since my early days of camping about 10 years ago Design has always stayed the same and I think this has always worked great Ive noticed that you can buy those propane canisters at Walmart far cheaper than the butane stuff Ive seen on here The flame is stead adjustable and constant immune to windy conditions It DOES NOT have a ignitor so you have to use a matchlighter to get it going but once it does it will continue till the canister runs dry An EASY rolling boil in 4 minutes or less CON Much heavier that the cheaper butane stoves with the 1lb propane canister and the stove section 
this is a great light weight unit when you dont want to carry a full Coleman stove I am going to make a carrier for the burner section to protect it from damage when packed 
Higher quality than I was expecting Nice inexpensive kit with everything you need to secure your tent The spikes are a lot better than the cheap plastic ones that come with most inexpensive tents Definitely a convenient little kit 
Always handy for camping 
heavy duty stakes and mallet are worth the price 
Such a great net 
I absolutely love this net The new is structurally sound and a breeze to set up I have yet to set it up in sand but in grass it is quick and painless I am an avid volleyball player and this net fits perfectly in the trunk of my car without taking up too much room 
The middle droops down making it too easy for the middle hitters to slam the ball into my face This a common problem with this model because the net is much more heavy duty than the cheaper models Otherwise its a very well constructed net I would probably get the model lower than this one so the middle doesnt droop down 
A quality volleyball net Easy to setup nice bag to carry it in and measured rope for the court It sets up quickly and its easy to tension the net to get good bounce and rebound action ok Im not a VB player but my daughter is and we have it set to the lowest of the 3 settings and it plays really well for her 
Good product and works well 
I bought this to use as a backup to cook with in the event of power failure or off in the woods somewhere Consistent burn and heats well 
Cant go wrong with Coleman products Works great just as described Very simple and easy to use Would recommend again 
it will work as advertised hopefully i need not use it but i have the burner and the twin propane light from colemanto be on the vigilant side i also among other items i have 3 boxes of coleman propane tanks we were without power last year for 8 days so this year if this happens we are better prepared 
This is very appealing to me because its very compact and uses standard propane cylinders and the runtime is excellent 
i am actually using this for a small heater it works very well and i am sure that it would be great for cooking with a small pot 
Beautiful set Easy to use for vacation fun The net is very well made and the poles are substantial 
Awesome set 
works great for the tent 
works well 
Our camping cups have all been the enameled steel variety After a few outings they get chipped and start to rust No more Stainless steel is definitely the way to go The cup is larger than our old enameled ones and wire handle is a little different as well The handle is large enough to be used with gloves which wasnt possible with our old cups Ive since bought more of these to fill out our camping supplies 
This is a big suckercompared to the ultralight stove LOL this thing almost seems abnormal after using ultralight products It gives good heat and can hold up a 10 cast iron skilletfor cooking those Kentucky channel cats on the spot The key with stove is the price of the fuel The canisters usually come in 2packs for less than 7 around my way and last reasonably long I doubt if I would take backpacking over night but definitely wont do with out it when using the car to tote gear 
Well made but the control to get a small flame on low doesnt happen Its either blazing or nothing Have to turn it off and start again to warm my coffee Really needs a better low flame 
No concerns It does the job Not much to talk about this item It feels good quality and it does what is made for 
Its a stove for cooking It seems like it can support whatever kind of pan you want to use It doesnt come with a propane tank though 
I decided for 14 I would buy this as a backup to my low profile Coleman stove It is well made and I can use it to boil water for my coffee as I use the other to cook my food It is a great combo for car camping It is not a backpacking stove but a simple well made stove The propane cylinders which do not come with this last a long time and are cheaper to use than with my backpacking stoves that use butanepropane mixture I think it it is pretty obvious that the cylinders are not included with this but some people continue to rate it poorly due to this I wish people would rate the product and not the perception of what is supplied with it 
We bought this just to keep on hand in case of an emergency We had a lot of the Coleman Propane cylinders sitting around from when our boys used to be in the Boy Scouts We also have a Coleman lamp that has been reliable that uses the same cylinders Would have been nice if it had a builtin spark lighter So keep plenty of long wooden matches on hand I also have a spark lighter that I use on my plumbing torch that should work good with this We have always had good luck with Coleman products over the years Sturdy and well made 
I like my Park  Sun Spectrum Classic Volleyball Net system Its easy to setup The net is tight and sturdy and holds up to vigorous play The anchor stakes are soft so their strike heads will bend if struck improperly by a hammer I bent the strike heads on two of the stakes while anchoring them into grasscovered turf they straightened later with some deliberate hammering 
Quality has gone down  Lines are feable and top of the net will never be able to be straight Sent and got a Costco net 
I thought this was a great item to take camping until I took it camping The mallet broke immediately leaving us without a mallet and we had to use rocks as a mallet The broom is also very small which wouldnt have bothered me except that our mallet broke It was so cheap and no use at all a total waste of money 
Handy tools 
A very handy little kit We used everything And its all pretty good quality We didnt have any problems with anything The stake puller thingy was a life saver The stakes themselves were actually better than the ones that came with the tent And I love when things come with a casebag for storage 
This little tent kit is great The stakes are much better than what came with my Coleman tent These can be pounded into the ground and they hold well in bad weather The little dust pan is handy for a quick clean up if people track stuff into your tent 
Great product 
For the 18 I paid this is perfect to support larger pots and skillets for lightweight car camping I used it this weekend to boil large pots of water beans etc 
I just received this today and tested it out No problems works as it should Bought it for a backup stove in the event the SHTF Always good to have a little redundancy Easy to operate and seems well made considering the price 
This is awesome Powerful efficient durable and convenient I have the 2 burner stove and it can compare to this single burner 
This is a mainstay in my camp I use it for coffee in the morning and to quick start the charcoal chimneys for the Dutch Ovens THere are weekend where I never pull out my camp stove from the patrol box just the single Coleman burner Pick up a Mr Heater quick fill adaptor for refilling the small bottles off the 20 tanks That is the set up 
its cheap It works its small which is the best part good for a three night trek through the woods 

very good 
Used to put together the Tailgaterz Magnetic Screen House Made the job simple Great add on product 
Junk 
great 
Perfect for camping as long as its on a level ground you can place any pot or skillet on top with out it tilting over Flame ranges from high to low 
A gas tank and stove into oneit doesnt get any more convenient It takes little space and its very stable The top doesnt seem to stop when it is being screwed in to the gas tank and Im guessing its because of the rubber seal in between Hopefully it doesnt leak I turned it on and it works fine 
This little burner is so sturdy Ive made the best sausage and eggs on this burner Great for perking coffee on 
i took this to the wilderness and it did what it needed this thing heats fast and cooks food in a flash and when youre starving after 8 hours of mountain hiking this is important im happy with it its good for a singleperson cooking small amounts but if a stable base or cooking surface was needed id hunt for something bigger and if compactlightweight style is preferred there are better small options If however like me you are cooking just for yourself and dont mind taking a little pack space its a great choice 
I bought this because it takes so long to boil water for the percolator on my regular 2 burner stove This does the trick perfectly Cuts boil time in half at least which makes for a much faster cup of coffee Plus now I can start my coffee and breakfast at the same time If i get much more camping equipment I think Im gonna need my own trailer 
Too difficult to set it on low 
Solid stove but for some reason the left burner NEVER lights for me unless I turn the gas on and use a BBQ lightermatch I probably should have returned it as soon as I got it but its easy enough to light it with a BBQ lightermatch and I bought it at the last minute for a camping trip Weve been camping a few times now with it though and its great to be able to put a big griddle over both burners to cook up food for a crowd I dont miss the days of trying to balance a big pan on my tiny old backpacking stove Just as an example of something you might do with this thing it takes about 7 minutes to boil up a pot of water on high heat to make a French Press full of coffee Not the speediest at heating up a ton of cold water but it could certainly be worse Something to consider I saw someone at a neighboring campsite who had some kind of adaptorhose so they could hook this up to an entire tank of propane Seems like a better idea than buying those dinky Coleman propane tanks for 5 Theres nowhere near me to return them so I just have a stack of empties in my shed waiting for the next hazardous waste removal event in town Its a lot easier and cheaper to exchange propane cylinders at the local grocery store or 711 
There is a click lock If it had a knobhandle to carry on I wouldve given 5 stars If you are moving it by car you dont need extra carrying case It wont open easily even without carrying case 
My old camp stove broke not a Coleman so I went searching for a new one that would be equal to the task My old one was smaller and I think the BTU output was less because it would take forever to heat water on it This one is quite powerful It is larger by far so my cast iron skillet fits better on it Used a camp stove griddle with both burners going it keeps the griddle pretty evenly heated I loved that my pancakes turned out so evenly cooked The only down side that I noticed is that when the thing is new it is a little difficult keeping the flame turned down low enough not to burn stuff I would turn the nob down a bit and the nob would not stay where I put it Once it warmed up and after a couple of uses I was able to get the flame more closely to how I wanted it to keep from burning things oh and for those that complain that this does not have room to store bottles of propane in it OF COURSE NOT No propane cook stove does that that I know of Only the white gasliquid fuel ones do that 
I love these stakes and the broomdust pan are very handy I am not sure the stake puller is needed for the sandy soil here in Florida but I may need it someday Nice rubber mallet 
EZ to use very handly 
Excellent 
This little kit is indispensable when setting up and taking down a big tent like I have The stake puller and rubber hammer makes the task easier And everyone wants to use the little broom and dustpan 
I get a kick out of reviewers here who deduct stars because they are surprised by the specs which are plainly displayed Yes the base is the size it is in the pic The burner is wide so your pans dont fall off And the regulator sticks out so its bulkier to pack It sits high just like in the pic so if somebody wobbles a picnic table it will tip over And no its not designed for backpacking do people know they also have to pack a bulky bottle to go with it Been using this for two Summers now Its a breeze to set up No builtin ignitor is fine by me  the less crap and gizmos they put on these things the less that will go wrong and the less you rely on said crap and gizmos It will boil a large pot of coffee in 5 minutes at 10000 feet A 12 pan sits just fine unattended on the large oversized burner but you have to stir more often from the middle  out 10 pans are perfect The flame is powerful and consistent you can tell just by the sound it makes The low setting is fine for simmering The regulator is NOT variable because you dont want to accidentally turn it off forcing you to relight over and over again Bottles screw in easily Its just the right height to sit on the ground and Ive never had it tip over If youre paranoid just put a couple of rocks on the base For those of you that cook in the wind newsflash Wind and fire do not mix Wind will carry the heat away Get a wind screen Ive been through at least 20 bottles on this thing It works the same way every time I just store it in a cheap vinyl bag I got somewhere For longer trips with 4 people this stove compliments a 2 burner stove perfectly 
Bought two of these for car camping instead of a 2 burner camp stove I figured these would be easier to pack up I found from two days using them it is difficult to know how low you can cut it before it goes out when you already have a pan on top cooking but that probably goes for any camp stove Both mornings it was breezy and raining and the wind was blowing across on the flames so I had to have the gas turned up relatively high Fortunately with the power these things provide I had no problem finishing the bacon Having them set on top of a picnic table a pan tip over twice due to other people moving while sitting at the table While they work fine I think I would have been better off with the dual burner camp stove for the stability of a lower cooking surface and the wind protection they provide I plan on making a plywood base to secure the two propane tanks and maybe a cooking grate to avoid any more tip overs 
Other than the cheesy feeling regulator which has a real problem at low flame I think its biggest draw back is the base Ive only used it once but so far I am not impressed The head burner is wide the body propane tank is long but the feet base is just too small The Coleman propane lantern has a much more stable base with fold out tabs and can even be used on grass yet the lantern is not meant to hold andor balance any weight on it With the propane tank it would be impractical to use back packing unless I can get the wife to carry it With the marginal base it makes a poor camp stove in my opinion and only suitable for use with a light weight mess kit on a hard flat surface Its just not a very stable setup that inspires any confidence when used with a fair sized pot or pan but it could be with a better base 
I like the heavierduty construction over the last portable camping stove I had from Coleman but that one had a piezo igniter builtin Its a good thing I brought a lighter with me because I assumed this one had a builtin ignition source too And you know what they say about assuming 
Review for Coleman PerfectFlow 1Burner Stove Uses 1lb propane cylinder This is an indirect criticism The burner works fine and seems solid Lots of heat output and apparently well made The problem is storing it If the design had been though out just a little bit better the plastic stable base would pack more closely with the burnerreflector assemble to make a smaller package I may try cutting 4 slots in the base to allow that It wouldnt be a big thing  The alternate might be to have some form of foldup feet that would allow the base to pack inside the reflector You can buy aftermarket stable bases that have swivel feet to reduce the diameter for storage 
Every time I use this I get exited about how well it is designed Setup is easy and you can get the net very tight easily It slowly loosens over time but a quick tug and youre back to perfect again Only improvement would be longer stakes if youre playing in sand The trick is to loosen the lines so your stakes are far from the net and at a 45 degree angle from the side linethen scoop away as much sand as possible to get down to more solid ground then angle the stakes back toward the pole and drive them as far as you can into the sand with a hammer Do it right from the start otherwise youll just be fighting it all day as the stakes pull out Plastic tent stakes work a little better than these stakes as long as you make sure you angle them back to the pole Anyways I highly doubt there is a better net out there in this price range 
Great system easy setup but why aluminum We have rust on most the parts with less than 4x out I expect short durability Also the stakes should be semi attached to the guy wires They are easy lose 
Used it for the first time on a camping trip easy to install easy to use and boy does it has some power It boils water super fast faster than my stove at home no kidding Overall a must have for camping or just to have a a spare 
I would recommend this stove for ease of lighting Be careful when turning the knobs it does not take much for the flame to shoot out from under whatever it is that you are cooking 
Folds up compact and uses the small propane tanks Cooked up some corn and baked beans and it did so really fast Holds a nice flame no complaints so far 
This is compact enough to carry with your other supplies and is easy to use The cannisters are readily available and are at a low cost 
Seems like a good price and well made I purchased this as a backup in case our power goes out as we only have an electric stove Will probably use it camping too 
great stove but heavy and bulky I took on a backpacking trip just to try it out and see if I liked it compared to the pocket rockets and yes I do like the ability to have a stable cooking device but make sure you have room and can afford the weight before hitting the trails 
Bought this stove for a family camping of four along with some cast iron skillets Couldnt be happier Pros 1 Compact in size Still sturdy I used 8 cast iron skillet and an 8 cast iron dutch oven on top of it It was perfectly balanced and stable 2 Heat Lots of it 3 Heat settings Unlike some other reviewers I was able to run this thing in low heat Cons Not much But I wish the heat setting knob could be regulated smoothly The knob changes in steps And the lowest step cannot keep the fire burning When I try to put it at the lowest setting it turns off Needed some time for me to get used to it 
A little on the heavy and bulky side but very stable and solid safe cooking unit Not what I would consider back packing material but that is not my intended use I bought it for a car day camper or backup for my larger Coleman stove Works great 
Not the smallest by far but meets my needs I have other micro stoves I use in smaller backpacks Heavy duty too 
Nice looking stove and cooks quickly but the InstaStart hasnt worked for me once Not a big deal because Im used to starting my camping stove with a match but Im disappointed because I thought that it would be a cool feature 
We have had this stove for a while and it has been a good one We dont use it often but it has always performed the way you would expect it to We used to live in the county and we had numerous power failures and in one bad winter storm that meant 3 days without power This little stove helped cook our meals and keep us going during that time period The stove sets up easy and the two burners are ideal to cook a larger meal with two things going at once The flame controls work well and you have good control over the heat setting you want to use which is important whether you are trying to boil water or make eggs for breakfast I also like how the cover and side wind shields lock together and help keep the flame steady and hold in the heat We always have some cylinders of propane around and they are inexpensive and easy to find The grill features an InstaStart spark igniter but to be honest I always carry matches or butane lighter as a backup The propane cylinder lasts a reasonable amount of time and the specs say 11 hours on high and 45 hours on low when using a 164 ounce propane cylinder with both burners going We always got that same usage or a little better This baby gets things hot fast and you dont need to use the full burner setting all the time We have been very happy with ours and it is ideal for camping or those emergency times when you lose power This is a very good product and I recommend it to you 
Bought it for emergency cooking when the power goes out Works well tough to keep a low flame but it does what I need it to do 
Great Net System but the tensioners do not hold I woundup using a ratcheting tiedown to accomplish that Easy to remedy Otherwise I really enjoy using this setup We play 23 times per week at a park with 78 other nets until it gets too dark to play 
Seems to be a good set Nothing fancy about it but it works 
Great price 
This kit came in handy 
As an avid camper and outdoors person I use my tent quit a bit and the only way to make a tent last is to make sure that you take really good care of it and this kit will definitely help you do that for sure The kit comes in a nice little mesh bag and includes four extra heavy duty tent stakes a convenient tent stake puller for those ones that dont want to come out of the ground easily a very nice quality rubber mallet to help drive tent stakes into rougher terrain like we have here in Oklahoma and my favorite part of the package is the nice little hand broom and dust pan for sweeping out the inside of the tent before you roll it up and pack it back in the bag for the next trip All in all this is a very nice addition to have in your camping gear for all of those excellent summer camping trips And as always when it comes to camping gear Coleman never lets me down with there quality products 
Received product today The shaft of the mallet was cracked from hilt to head Not entirely sure how someone didnt notice that before it got packed Lets see if replacement any better  hopefully receive before my next camping trip Dustpan and brush snaps together which is convenient  very low profile as well It could fit in one of the tent inner pockets The bristles are white nylon so looks a bit nicer than one in photo 
great item 
This is an absolutely amazing buy Anyone i know who camps is getting this for their birthday or christmas The quality is amazing the propane tanks are cheap and easy to find it boils water quick and like a dream and its small The biggest thing i put on top of it was a big pot of water to boil corn on the cob and it held it without a problem 
Screws on my hand tight flame burner is lots of holes with a hot blue flame  ordered another and another 
Recieved my 1burner stove today The burned is very nice quality nice and heavy You cant go wrong with it 
For the price this is a very nice stove One burner lights easily with the instaspark method the other burner is more stubborn but does light after 5 or 6 clicks There is plenty of heat available from each burner and the windscreens sides and rear do a good job I havent used up a full canister of propane yet but from the sound of the gas whooshing through those burners I suspect Colemans estimate of how long a canister will last are well not conservative The only thing I would have changed in the design is to add a friction hinge to the top lid There is absolutely nothing to prevent that lid from crashing all the way over unless you hold it and gently lower it My first opening sure got my attention when that metal lid went banging over onto the table top Now that I know what to expect no big deal but a friction hinge would be a nice touch Thumbs up Buy one and get the coffee on itll be hot in no time 
This is a great stove for camp cooking Burns hot and cooked everything I needed on my last camping trip Definitely worth the money spent Also very easy to clean 
The design of this propane stove is nice but after a single use the propane regulator on the stove didnt work That left us with five camping days left to go and no way to cook Im pretty disappointed as Coleman has a good reputation 
Excellent Professional Quality and Features 
Rubber mallet cheaply made in contrast to what you might find at a hardware store but it does the job Stakes sharp plastic hooks have survived their first camping trip not enough of them Dust Pan too small for the tent size    my bad Hand Broom too small for the tent size Overall for the price you are getting what you pay for I will likely just go to the hardware store for a regular size dust pan and hand broom Best part of the deal is the mesh bag     which you can also get at the hardware store 
All you need for a 2 or 3 person dome tent 
Honestly everything in this little kit comes in handy The mallet is perfect for tent stakes The stakes are much more sturdy than those that come standard with tents The broom and pan is great for cleaning out the tent and the stake puller makes the whole process easier on your hands For the price I highly recommend this kit 
Compact  easy to carry 
Tent stakes are crap why put plastic It just breaks But hammer and little broom are useful  
Good kit and it really comes in handy to clean up stuff The pegs are good quality and I like the peg puller that was included Thanks a lot

The Coleman stove does not look like much bit it performs well I have been using one for a few years and have been completely satisfied with its performance I was a little uncomfortable with it at first as it did not look stable bit have not had any problems with it Coffee a frying pan for breakfast or a small pot for a stew all worked equally well and it will boil water in a few minutes The burner will rust a little but still works well It is big for backpacking but not impossible It is a perfect size for an outing where you have motor transport Overall a great stove for the campground or when you need coffee but do not have access to a stove E M Van Court 
The stove is big enough for a 10 inch potpan but if you use bigger once you need to be very careful The plastic base provides nice stability but still you need to use a flat surface A camping table bench or plain ground will work just fine I dont know if the power level is a stove feature or just has to do with how much Propane you got in your tank but using a brand new Propane tank I was able to get excellent power out of this stove In general I would highly recommend getting a portable stove if you are into hiking camping or any outdoor activity the one thing I would love if they included is a robust carrying case for this stove  1 or 2 tanks similar to ones they make for Propane lanterns 
It was as lightweight as i hoped and put off a great amount of heat The controls are a little wonky but you adjust to them quickly One thing i wish it did was nest a little better with the base It takes up a ton more room than it needs to and when youre packing light that is a conern Also a piezoelectric lighter would make it an easy 5star product and id be happy to pay extra for that But seriously who doesnt bring at least 1 fire starting device with them camping 
I recently bought two of these stoves and they are great They are small and compact They set up quickly and work perfectly The instant start feature is really helpful because it seems I can never find the matches 
My dad had some Coleman gear when I was a kid about 40 years ago but I havent gone camping in those intervening decades so had no idea what had happened with the legendary Coleman name in all this time As soon as I pulled this stove out of its carefullypacked box I could see that they still were building highquality equipment The stove sets up within a couple of minutes and provides a very stable base Stability is of paramount importance if youre going to use it in realitybased situations instead of on the back porch because nature is not flat nor smooth in most places In a disaster or other emergency things are dark confused and in a huge mess one of the last things you need is for some of your dwindling food supply to topple over while the stove happily starts your shelter on fire That will not happen with this Coleman stove on the ground The two gas valves are large for precise flame control and have a silky feel to them The off position cinches the valves down tight The lid and side wind shields hook together and stay that way until you want them to come apart The chrome grill comes off easily for cleaning Propane for this stove is inexpensive and readily available at our local stores You can disconnect a partiallyused propane cylinder and use it again later I got this one to add to our emergency gear for when the next power outage hits wish Id done it two outages ago 
Amazing outdoor nets good for some time uses or years of weekly uses 
This is an awesome net I have quite a few friends who had given me compliments in regards to how well made it is I have only played with the net in the grass so I cannot speak to its durability in the sand I am not at a competitive level but I am good enough to utilize an intermediate net like this I have no complaints so far and it seems to be holding up quite well The bag has ample room to carry everything in the bag I purchased this one because it had the handled guy wires instead of the metal ring I think I made the right choice because I have had no issues with slippage 
love it 
The rubber mallet fell apart the first time I used it 
Price was good Product is great Shipping was fast 
Wonderful net I might even buy another one 
I used one for several years almost daily and still have it You must put a drop of oil on the rubber seal and threads and might need to eventually replace the rubber washer coleman has it You can clean the burner holes by burning off residue with a lighter and clearing them with a sharp pencil or toothpick I used mine as a truck driver to heat coffee and make lunch or breakfast You can get the most burntime from this by shielding it well from wind Do not use inside your truck I had the best results from a medium sized nonstick pot It will work on iron skillets but takes more fuel You can refill green cans at home from a large white propane cannister and adapter Buying them in bulk is also economical Target had the lowest prices usually for offbrand ones 
This is built fairly well and is ready for action Note Does not come with fuel bottle I have a Coleman lantern that runs on the same fuel so this thing is perfect for me I can interchange the fuel bottles in a pinch This will boil water very quickly so no waiting for the first cup of joe in the morning The only drawback is the fuel knob its a little wobbly I tried to tighten it up but no dice Otherwise its a great little stove A little heavy to haul around on long hikes great for shorter stuff where weight isnt an issue 
The good news is this thing puts out a lot of heat It will boil water faster for coffee than my power burner on my kitchen stove Its heavy tough nicely chromed and finished and seems like a good value for the money So why the three stars Well its the heat You cant turn it down The lowest setting is blasting enough to burn any kind of food you might be trying to cook and the burner simply goes out below that If youre just making coffee this is like a jet engine If you really need to cook something it has some problems 
Great net system held tension very well  plays and feels like a pro system Ball bounces great off the net 
everything you need in a bag 
Good set up 
Not a bad tent kit could use a couple of upgrades to make it a 5 star First the bag they give you a mesh type bag which allows the dirt to fall out is way to large of a mesh The problem is the tent pegs and the stake puller poke through Then theres the stake puller as others have mentioned bends easily when pulling out the tent pegs Whats the use in having one if it bends Come on guys You can do better than this I did find the rubber mallet to be sturdy and sufficient in getting the job done The dust pan works fine its small and compact good for spot cleaning the floor and other areas If you tend to track in a lot of dirt I suggest getting a larger dust pan Had no complaints on the tent pegs way better than what came with my Coleman tent Theyre sturdy durable and with the pointed ends I had no problem pounding them into the rocky hard ground They stayed in place and did their job well All in all not a bad kit for the price but definitely could use some improvements 
In the state I live in the weather can be treacherous and if stranded people have died from hypothermia so I needed an emergency travel kit that would provide some heat and hot coffee and food in the event I was stranded and this fit my kit perfectly I saw one of these at my neighbors and this is exactly what I needed Fast service and excellent product 
I purchased this stove for emergencies Its very simple to use and has very good heat output I brought a full teakettle of cold water to a full boil in 10 minutes I would definitely recommend this stove 
Great little stove for emergency use we lose power here in NHoften it can be for a long timenbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefColemanPefectFlow1BurnerStovedpB0009PUR5ErefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTF8Coleman PefectFlow 1Burner Stovea 
This little stove is perfect for tailgating The top is wide enough for most sauce pans and frying pans The heat output is strong enough to fry steaks and bacon on a seasoned cast iron pan although the heat dispersion could be a little better but I suspect thats more of a pan not a stove issue and the little one pound propane cans last surprisingly long For those that tailgate I find that the cans normally last me about three games worth of pre and postgame tailgatingbasically a half hours worth of full blast cooking before and a half hour after games Get it you wont be disappointed and for the price its a great addition to any emergency kit 
While this stove creates plenty of heat and will do so under wet windy conditions The few times i have used it when I was finished with the stove and removed the gas cylinder for transport The Cylinder SEALS were compromised and leaked until the cylinder was EMPTY I have several other stoves which use the same cylinders and NONE of them compromise the cylinder seals Dangerous waste of fuel and a definite weakness in stove function 
Single burner unit works very well and is very sturdy with a wider base plate than on cheaper models by other companies Radiates heat and quickly cooks with either a sauce pan or frying pan A bargain at this price 
Purchased this stove for our family to use as part of our emergency backup supplies This stove is easy to storeand 1lb bottles of Propane are very easy to store We have two of these stoves to provide the ability to cook and heat water for meals or what ever you need in case of an Emergency situation The stove is almost like your stove top at home as far as flame adjustabiliysimmer to boil Of course you would need to have plenty of ventilation if you use the stove inside your home The nice thing to is it could be used in your family car camping trips Coleman still makes a quality product in this day and age even though this product is made overseas Did I mention the price that Amazon has for this itemright now its 1899 with free regular shipping That is awesome Amazon would like to say Thank You for the Great Service and fast shipping of this great product 
I got this so that I could have coffee at deer camp Usually our big stove is busy with eggs and bacon in the mornings for 8 guys so I needed something to start a pot of coffee without tying up the big stove I was a little skeptical about the sturdiness of a vertical type burner but even with a pot of coffee perking along on top of it it remained stable and boiled the water and started perking in a few minutes It packs down to take up very little space Control knob provides plenty of flame control and is easy to manipulate even with coldgloved hands It cools off pretty fast It has only been used about 15 times over 2 seasons so far but it has held up with minimal protection during transport and storage 
Especially if you have an electric stove I use it during power outages I think the tank would make it a bit heavy for to carry but for car camping or for backyard use its great 
On a recent backpacking trip our group was loaned this stove to use for cooking our meals at each stop I have to say I worked like a charm We had no trouble getting it started It heated water like a dream It was windy and there were no blow out issues The pot sat on the stand evenly without even the tiniest of tipping Now my con It was a little big for us to pack out I own the Pocket Rocket which I didnt bring because I was out of fuel and really wished I had it with just for the size consideration If you are simply camping and only need a one burner stove This may be the one for you 
Nice carrying bag solid construction nice tight net nice boundary rope Easy to setup in just a couple minutes Easy to break down You get what you pay for and this net will last a long time and provide many hours of enjoyment 
Greetings fellow amazonians I picked this up to go in my bug out bag for the impending zombie apocalypse I figured with the stakes and mallet I can do some damage to those buggers and then I can use the broom if I need to clean up any of the mess Too bad I havent found one zombie since I bought this thing I am planning on heading to Alexandra VA soon maybe I will find them there 
handy 
Very good product 
Nice compact kit but mine came with only 3 pegs 
Definitely a nice little tent kit for the price its a must for camping its very compact 
this kit is very sturdy and well made i love the bag it comes with to keep it organized however you may want to invest in some more tent stakes 
Very good product 
They worked great with my recent off the grid camping trip 
Disappointing Plastic on tent stakes broke very easily during a storm and everything in the kit is of mediocre quality 
Nice accessory kit for the tent Suits the need and I would recommend to others 
worked as aspect ed and shipped fast 
workes perfect in my deer blind great heat gas last on high for two full days of hunting 
Deer blind heater at its best This thing kept my blind 40 degrees when it was 0 outside Thats all anyone can ask for You do want to run a can of fuel through it before taking it out Need to burn off the new Other than that fire it up and stay warm 10 hours on a tank of gas Going to buy another when stores get restocked after Christmas 
As hot as it feels when you put your hand to it it wont heat up even a small tent 
These stakes folded like an accordian and I was using a rubber mallet in wet ground 
Throw in a couple spare cylinders and matches or fire source you get noodles rice  beans and neighbors Works great Starkist or spaghetti your choice 
Unpacked it and fired it up Impressive stove Sturdy materials and construction Just the thing to have for emergencies or camping Too big for extended backpacking trips but thats not why I bought it 
im the type of person i will buy things for no reason just because and this product i bought because for one it was the last product and two i thought i was cool lol the funny thing happen when i bought this 2 days after i got this we lost power in the entire town for days i told my wife lets not worry the colemans here lol haha bring up the spirit regardless of power as long as i had this to eat and drink we were pretty good that same day i ran back and got me 15 refills just incase now i keep it in my closet im not gonna lie it felt pretty cool only cuz i felt like i was camping at home with everything needed hehe but i love this product its stable has a great stand for it the fuel last pretty good if u know how well to use it and the price is great i will deff recommend this and i will buy another one  great job 
A quality product at a great price with good shipping I would recommend this to both friends and family This is a great buy 
Works Great 
Great kit Must have 
I love this little kit It is a must have for camping this spring It comes with everything you will need to set up and take down your tent My husband is so happy we got this with our new tent Everything is made well and I highly recommend I would definetly purchase again It comes with 4 stakes a malletstake removerbroomdustpanand carrying case 
Great kit for light work or base camping 
havent used this yet but Im sure it will hold the tent down when the time comes 
I have purchased several of these portable heaters over the years for tents cars trucks and boats This one was the most disappointing I was in a car that broke down in Southern Ohio one winter night I could barely feel the heat from this heater inside I had some blankets which kept me warm until morning when someone came by This heater is useless 
Great for warming your hands at a ball game or indoors in a hunting blind It is a must have for hunting with my son 
best tent stakes you can get I would have geven them a five but the price is getting more and more exspencive 
Easy to put in the ground Come out clean Held in the wind40 mph very well Ample hook on them both for holding vestibules and snagging when removing from the ground Glad I had them because the stakes provided with the tent were very inadequate 
Werent impressed in any way They were s easy to bent and wouldnt buy again 
This is a huge bag It is well made more like a big collapsible cooler I store the newest Coleman Hot Water On Demand Unit in this bag with all the hoses and a couple bottles of 16oz Fuel Cans in the side pockets 

Fits perfectly Accessories too 
A little tempermental in that it can get extremely hot in seconds Not a bad thing though If you want to be able to turn the water on and off throughout your shower experience without having to turn the unit on and off you can install a valve on the hose But you must be sure to install a bypass valve that allows the water to go somewhere otherwise you WILL burn up your pump The water needs to continually flow Best way for me was to follow example of a very helpful you tube vide guy in garage where he used an open mouthed jug instead of the bladder bag it comes with He rigged his system with a bypass valve that routed the water back to the jug when not spraying through the nozzle Not only does this recycle your water so you dont waste any from letting in spill on the floor when not using it soaping up but it saves your pump AND sends heated water back to the water source where your thermostat senses it Guess what happens You burn less gas heating water because the reccyling effect sends hot water back to the source and you end up with a bucket of hot water pretty much set to the temperature you desire CAnt beat this product at all Read all the positive reviews that offer lessons learned If you follow their examples and advice you will definitely enjoy this product Mine did not leak anywhere BECAUSE I did not block water flow Blocking water flow with a simple on off valve instead of a bypass valve causes pressure to build up in the pump and in the unit You have to imagine that building up pressure in anything is not good Be sure to rig a three way bypass system that allows water to flow in one way and out two ways nozzle line or second line that runs back to water source or wherever else you want it to go Enjoy this product because you can Also the best way to use this product for us was in a twosided shower tent We had the unit propped up on a simple stool on the dry side near the door so we could easily reach out of the shower side and make water temperature adjustments Having it outside the stall like the guy in the you tube video did not work for us as we could not control the water temperature on the fly With a recirculating water setup you are going to want to have this level of control because the hot water will return to the jug and you may get some of that back doubly hot unless you turn down your temperature setting just right Plus the space a double stall affords just makes your outdoor camping shower experience that much more pleasant day or night battery operated lanterns inside stalls 
Waiting for spring to take this out of the box but I love the idea that I already have it and can put it up when the kids are looking for something entertaining to do 
This is a really great system One of the higher quality outdoor nets that dont take an hour to set up However when i set it all up the boundary lines were WAY TOO BIG It was a good 2 feet bigger on all sides I had to knot each corner off to make it the correct length Outside of that great system 
My entire family plays volleyball and when it was finally time for us to buy our own net system we turned to ParkNSun based on our long familiarity with their systems at numerous grass volleyball tournaments over the years We chose the Spectrum Classic as a balance between a competition quality system and affordability Set up is super easy and the net affords a decent amount of play It is not as tight as a fully competitive system so digging a ball out of the bottom of the net is possible but not consistent Similarly net serves into the top tape behave differently than say a steel cable reinforced indoor net However the net does not sag and the blue vinyl is great for visibility The entire system is well made and appears to be quite durable even the travel bag The lines provided with the system are typical corded nylon rope We opted to upgrade the lines with competition grade flat tape lines from VolleyballUSAcom which are adjustable to the smaller FIVB court as well as the traditional court sizes 
burn a half tank of propane outside before using it smells during the first use after that it works great for a 1 or 2 person tent anything larger would require a larger unit 
We bought this for the golf cart at out campground for the early spring late fall and winter We tried it the last of October it did ok I dont think it will put out enough to really warm the cart up but it will knock the chill off We have a cover on the cart as well 
I actually purchased 2 of these for our base camp  one for cooking pasta while the other was cooking meat and veggies These burners are built heavy and strong The stove is nice and sturdy and is able to simmer as well as it can boil water And let me tell you this boiled water very quickly with the lid on I was quite impressed I used to use only my charcoal grill which left us waiting a while for our meal Now we eat in no time after a long day of hiking If youre looking to backpack with this I would definitely look elsewhere due to the weight However for your family base camp this is perfect 
this stove like all coleman products works great and is very stable however be warned that it is a bit big and not good for backpacking great for car camping and great value 
We take a couple of these stoves into the boundary waters every year and never have a problem We accidentally left one out in a rain storm all day and the burner filled with water Turned it over to drain out the majority of the water and fired it up Only about half of the burner was lit at first but it quickly burned off the rest of the water and was back to its old self I love this stove BTW I could have bought it cheaper locally if Id know where to find it Shop around 
Great supplement to the tent 
Great camping companion Has all the necessary stuff 
great little kit bought extra stakes though 
Convenient kit to have during camping 
These stakes work great 
These worked very well in hardpacked dry earth riddles with hidden stones I did bend a couple of the heads hitting the aforementioned buried rocks but it was easy enough to straighten them back out after we packed up camp 
Durable tent stakes for a Coleman Tent Can also be used for staking down tarps or holding down ropes Not really much to say but a well constructed tent stake 
I bought these for an umbrella I bought I think I should have gone with a longer size I still have to put something on the back of the umbrella to make sure it doesnt go anywhere Maybe I set them in concrete Any suggestions 
These stakes are GREAT They are SOLID 12inches and constructed well that you could step on it and hammer it without fearing that it would bend Weve only used it at the beach but they were great 
Great price and good quality 
If your going to get the water heater this bag will protect it very well It is a very thick padded bag that almost could double as a cooler It has plenty of room for the other items such as the shower wand charger collapsible water jug and the chargers as well Even room for a bottle of fuel 
Nice good quality bag Its large and will take up as much room in your vehicle as the box your hot water unit came in However the box continues to take up room this bag can be squished to take up less space once emptied They included a nice cover to go over your unit when it is not in use The bag has a carrying strap and there is plenty of room to carry any additional accessories you have purchased for your unit I have always stored my hot water heater in the box but I would feel comfortable storing the unit in this bag its that nice 
The net is durable I found setting up and taking down the net was easy and fast Not cheap but worth the extra few dollars 
It works as advertised Remember only 1500 btu but 14 hours run time Im happy Will work in a small cabover camper and take the chill out of 32 degree nights 
Good quality for the price 
These are junk They tore up my rubber mallet when hammering them in They also bent when trying to hammer them into the Black Rock City Playa They never came out under decent wind but they bent so bad during removal that I had to throw them all away after the first and only use  
Great product great price wonderful seller Thanks 
Great stove Stable and capable of a great deal of heat In fact low setting is generally all I ever have to use I originally got it because the propane burner on my gas grill was anemic and I prefer doing all of my messy type cooking outdoors since I live in the mild climate of SC Boy that was a great move This thing puts out plenty of heat and makes the most out of a propane cartridge I use it for all my stir frying and pan frying at the house Click throttle adjustments make getting the right heat setting a snap Simmers well Superior to electric elements I use it outside on the picnic table It easily handles all of my pans I suspect the 2 burner perfect flows are very good as well 
Coleman makes the best camping gear and this stove attachment is perfect for backpacking Its lightweight and is wide enough 8 inches to steadily hold any pot or pan The regulator can be turned down very low and still not be blown out by wind Easily attaches to Coleman propane containers and has a nice canister base that is also steady You really dont need more than one of these for two campers Cleans easily as well 
I like the simplicity of the design and the light weight The 8 inch top is big enough to hold big cookware You need to bring your own ligher to light the fire not a big deal I give it 4start not because of any defact from this product but because Amazons price is too high WalMart sells this for only 1996  
Simple kit but a good deal if you need a rubber mallet I find myself using the broom a lot to clean out the tent before breaking down at the end of a camp out Stakes and stake puller are fine as well Good quality product 
Great tent accessory kit if you purchase one just I wish they added more spikes most tents need 8 
Very heavy duty which of course means very heavy so its not something youd take backpacking The stake puller is my favorite part as once you hammer down stakes they can sometimes be very difficult to get back out 
The Pegs are great long and sturdy The pick is useful to take it out It will be a pain otherwise Mallet is good and mesh is good The brush is ok 
We play quite a bit of volleyball mostly grass but some beach I havent seen a better portable net system I would buy it again without reservation Minor improvements could be made are you listening ParkSunSpectrum drain holesgrommets in bottom cord of net it accumulates dewrain when left outside a couple days two inch longer spikes theyll pull out if you tighten your net in wet soil sturdier sand disks two of our four are cracked sturdier and wider plastic at bottom of poles everybody I know ends up adding their own wooden blocks to net to offset sinking of poles into ground marks on lines at 10 feet from net for reverse coed similar to markings at net 
The product is very high quality exactly like I expected It comes with a nice case for traveling with it 
All the reviews are true this is a surprisingly wellmade case I thought I broke my Coleman water heater on a trip to Toroweap Point last winter Turns out it was just too cold it wont heat very well if the water is near freezing But it made me paranoid enough that I invested in this case Worth the money 
Amazing bag  big and wide and u can use it for so many things not only for the hot water keeping also the material is tough I recommend it for trips and campaigns 
Had I not done something about the first bag I ordered I may still be waiting on it I cant remember the sellers name right now but I had to wait two months before Amazon would do anything about it I paid expecting to receive this as part of CJs Christmas gift I heard absolutely nothing from the seller Anyway Two months later I got my refund and found and paid for another MORE EXPENSIVE bag Overall Im quite happy with the bag Its plenty large has extra pockets and nicely padded  I dont expect any problems from this fine piece of Coleman equipment 
I used a hammer and one of the stakes bent I bent it back but it wasnt the same again They do go deep enough for a tight hold Make sure you use a thick mallet when beating these guys in 
Just as described These tent stakes work great and are very sturdy We were planning a big camping trip and decided to give them a try since they are such a great price Im glad we did We had some pretty heavy wind while camping and these held up fantastically  I would def recommend them to others Thank you 
These appear to be steel not galvanized metal 
Bought for a gift 
Not worth a dime I purchased this for a camping trip and it had rained the day before I went camping so the ground was really soft I used the rubber mallet to hammer in the stakes and the rubber part fell off 
And these metal rods Received this before my tent but the set looks nice 
Cute little set 
This is made of High Quality Materials and offers Good Protection to the Water Heater Side pockets are Handy for all the Accessories made for the Unit Well Worth the Price 
We only use it for showers so no comment on other uses Hard to control the temperature so that it is neither too hot nor too cold Sometimes it is hard to get the burner to turn on Economical of fuel The battery is too small needs at least double the capacity Be prepared to charge it about every 4 showers 
Bag is quality made It is padded so it protects the coleman hot water heater It has heavy duty handles that has velcro on them so carrying the bag is made easy There is room for all the accessories including the hose adapter power adapters shower attachment hoses etc Plus there is a big pocket on the side for the collapsible water container Last there are drain hole on the bottom so if you have water come out after you detach everything its no big deal If you have the portable hot water heater I would buy this carrying bag Its worth it I was leery about buying it site unseen but now that I have it I am glad I did 
Whether boating camping etc This makes it very simple to carry with you and two tanks of gas Saves a lot of space and having to carry separate items 
This catalytic propane heater is adequate for a very small area such as a hunting blind but it does not put out enough heat for use as an emergency heater at home or for an RV There are other larger more expensive catalyst propane heaters available that you could use for those applications if you pay attention to the safety precautions With this heater the propane burns very efficiently in the catalyst disc so carbon monoxide production is greatly reduced However the instructions caution that you still must provide a ventilation opening to outside air for oxygen and to vent any carbon monoxide The earlier instructions included with this heater model and the similar older matchlit version strangely did not mention the necessary breakin period I think some reviewers say the instructions now cover this You must initially run this heater for a number of hours outside or in a vented garge to get rid of an initial bad smell Its probably best to burn a whole small propane bottle If you dont do this you could have a very unpleasant experience breathing in whatever smelly stuff it burns off the new catalyst disc for the first few hours After that it will only have a very slight musty odor that is not too noticeable if you use adequate ventilation as the instructions say However if you are sensitive to odors this could be still be a problem There is no flame and the combustion takes place inside the catalyst disc but you still must be careful not to put it near flammable items due to the high radiant heat right above the the screencovered disc 

My wife and I love this net We had gotten a cheaper one to use at our park but once we got this one we garage sold it This net is so easy to setup and take down You can easily adjust the height from womens to coed to mens Very sturdy design we will have this for a long time I highly recommend this net to any volleyball player 
good 
These are long and do a good job going deep into the ground and doing what stakes do But watch out for rocks These things bend with the slightest bit of resistance 
Nice and strong 
they work great 
Bought this to supplement the tent we bought for the kids for Christmas 
lots of useful stuff in this kit Peg puller is very useful 
This is a decent little tent kit for camping The broom and dust pan are very handy The mallet is handy and the tent pegs are typical plastichead tent stakes and they do the job Be careful when placing them in hardpacked dirt as the plastic tips easily break off when you pull the stakes out Also the pegpuller is handy but again if your stake is in hard earth the puller can itself bend as well as break the plastic head off of the stake It all stores nicely out of the way in the included sack 
Always good to have on hand 
This was great to use with our Tent Great to buy all together to save money Stakes work great 
I bought a Coleman tent that came with plastic stakes The metal stakes are a must have to anchor down the tent when you go camping Everything in this set will make pitching up a tent and cleaning up afterwards more enjoyable However the weak point of this set is the rubber piece on top of the stakes When I used the stakes on the campground the stakes were stuck on the ground pretty hard It took a lot of strength to remove it and the plastic piece on one of the stakes broke in half when trying to pull the stake out 
All I can say this heater is Nothing more than a glorified hand warmer Using a thermometer in my garage this thing did NOT raise it up one degree I even left it on all night and sealed up my garage tight and after 12 hours no change in temp at all This thing would only keep you warm only if you sat on it 
We bought these to provide additional security to our Sport Brella umbrella and for the Travel Hammock ParaSheet Beach Blankets we bought They work great have not bent nor rusted We bought a rubber mallet we keep in our Tommy Bahama beach cart to hammering these in as far as they can go and nothing flies awaywhile we see other umbrellas flying down the beach 
Love it would buy again 
If youre trying to go through tough soil these stakes just bend For rocky soil youre better off using 10 ring shank landscaping nails 
This net is everything that all other reviewers have written about it Easy to put up 10 minutes with 2 people easy to tighten and everything from the poles to the net and the boundary lines have a quality feel to them I purchased the net and promptly used it to play about 5 hours of volleyball on the Fourth of July Everyone commented about the increased quality of the net tightness of the net and the ball play that could be had off the net compared to the set which Ive used in the past My only problem is that with less than a full days worth of play in a few places on the net the twining broke in about 2 or 3 areas Now its not a major problem as the integrity of the net is still there but I was disappointed that even a portion of the net would break on the first day of use Anyways its a great net and Im assuming that the net I got had some manufacturing imperfection or defect and probably does not bode for the quality of all Park  Sun nets but I cannot give it the five stars that it probably deserves 
good 
High quality and perfect for replacing the stock stakes that come with your offtheshelf tent Perfect for camping in windy conditions 
Aluminum and not sufficiently rigid to be hammered into hard soil deform halfway in 
As should be 
I didnt have any design or function problems with my unit at all It worked fine right out of the box For my purpose heating a tent or a small bedroom in case of a power outage Id buy it again and the price is right BTW the Winter temps in northwest WA are usually pretty mild at sea level so although the 1500 BTU output isnt much it is all I need The very first time I lit my unit I was puzzled why it took 5 or 6 clicks of the instastart spark to light it even though Coleman predicts this in their instructions By telling you to start clicking the spark right after opening the valve I suspect Coleman is making sure you dont let a large amount of propane build up before you hit the button In other words I suspect it takes the same amount of time to click the starter 5 or 6 times as for the unit to build up enough propane to light When it does there is a small poof of blue and yellow flame True if you waited a few minutes after you open the valve to click the starter one click might be enough to light the unit but you might also lose your eyebrows or worse One thing for sure run your heater outside or maybe in your garage for a LONG time when it is brand new In fact Id say use up a whole container of propane to break it in The reason for this is that the smell this heater puts out when it is new is nasty Ever get a rug stuck in the rotating brush of your vacuum cleaner and the rubber drive belt starts to smoke Well its like that smell TIMES TEN I couldnt find any mention of the odor or warnings about toxicity in the Coleman booklet so Coleman must not think is is harmful But believe me it sure is unpleasant and Coleman should mention the idea of breaking in the heater when new After I ran about 34 of a tank of propane through my new heater the smell was completely gone But fair warning break this puppy in before you bring it inside with you Otherwise no complaints and Id buy it again and recommend it to you Stay warm out there 
The stakes work well except for the stupid plastic parts Those really should be metal The mallet is fine The brush is a little small but works fine The puller thing is useless unless your stakes are in loose sand It just bends when you put too much pressure on it 
A product and quality service 
Some of the pieces seem a little cheaply made but what would you expect from Coleman Really good value for what you pay and it does whats intended 
good little kit to keep handy in large and small tents 
I used this on the beach in Costa Rica for 3 weeks straight It is a great product and I would buy again The only issue I had that the 10 spikes were not long enough for the sand we were playing on and would easily pull up every once in awhile due to spikes or someone running into the net which would result in any other net being pulled down It was easy and quick to set up and fast and easy to take down I loved the boundary rope spool that was used to wind the rope after play Would buy again 
Unless you are driving these into sand or really soft grass they are crap They are not at all durable and tend to bend easily 
Awesome durable tent stakes I use these tent stakes for staking my turkey blinds down in the windy conditions of spring in Wisconsin Never had a stake pull out ever  The strong wind did rip the tie down of a cheaper blind however The stakes are difficult to bend if you drive them in at the angle to secure your tent Did bend one by using a rock to drive it in the ground did not drive the stake level hit it on the side and forced the stake to bend After that I always take a stake mallet to drive the stakes in properly 
These are basic stakes that were cut from a solid sheet and then bent and stamped to provide a more ridged stake These should be used in soft ground with windy conditions eg the beach With proper maintenance and cleaning after use they should last a very long time 
The classic is better than the 2000 series It has wider poles and better lines and spikes Best bang for buck 
These bent the first time we used them Im thinking maybe they would work well in sand but nothing else They definitely make much better ones that we now have 
These stakes are a little pricy for what they are I bought them simply to fill out my cart in order to get the 20 off of 100 spent on select Coleman promotion that Amazon was running You can probably find these for a better deal in the camping aisle of the local box store 
Its exactly what its suppose to be 
Finally got a chance to use these last weekend while camping and I really like it and glad I got it Very well made and is a necessity for camping 
I failed on being present for shipping days so I never actually received this product because they need to be signed for due to their weaponlike nature I will most likely purchase these again when I need new stakes as some of my other purchases did not work out so great but these are definitely still on the short list of awesome new camping gear to acquire 
I used these to stake down a Christmas inflatable on my front lawn The lawn is fairly soft and was actually wet when I put these in If you do not strike them exactly dead center and you increase your chances of them bending Not a deal breaker for me because these are meant to slow down any jerk who might want to steal my inflatable But I can see the frustration if you were trying to use them when camping to secure a tent from the wind having these bend on you would surely ruin a trip if you had high winds to deal with 
Have been wanting a little broomdustpan for the tent and a mallet to get the stacks in and booyah this has both for a good price without having to go to the store Im sure the extra stacks will come in handy as the tool to pull them out did It all fits in a small convenient mesh bag to throw into the camping gear box Good purchase Doesnt take up a lot of space and was nice to have on our car camping trips this summer 
Very helpful backup 
Great deal 
This is SUPER cheap The stakes are VERY light weight and the only nice part of all of this is the rubber mallet The other pieces are not worthit 
These where just what I need to keep my new Gardman BA01136 Pedestal Bird Bath  Antique Verdigris 195 wide x 28 high that I also purchased from Amazon in place in the back yard Just paint them a flat black May need to repaint periodically 
If youre a real trekker carrying all your gear tent food and water then this is not the product for you These are very heavyduty tent stakes suitable for a very large tent or for securing a tent that is going to be in very windy weather They are big and heavy way too much for lightweight or weightconscious camping That being said in the threeodd years Ive had these stakes they go in and they stay in This is for hand placement or a stomp with a boot If youre using a hammer and you run these things down into the earth they are as secure as you can get and its going to take a tornado to take your tent away But surprisingly they have always come out very easily They usually come out with a simple hand pull or I just hook one stake into the other and they come out with this method I have experienced absolutely no bending with these stakes They have not even had their blades bent or warped from emplacement or removal They are very tough very sturdy and will retain their shape My only complaint is that they stain very easily and quickly After one campout there was considerable staining on all stakes from contat with earth They always clean up easily in hot water with a quick brush They still work fine and still have not rusted but they are very blotchy as the staining is blackdark gray This staining has had no effect on performance Bottom line for car camping or other equipmentheavy camping or for use where your tent or fly or shelter needs to be secure this is a great purchase well worth the price But for true trekking and hikeinout camping these are really more than you need 
I got this mainly for the extra stakes and for the extra buck vs just the stakes I figured a spare mallet and stake puller wouldnt hurt Overall it is what I expected The stakes are good but over time the plastic heads break The stake puller is good but using it sometimes breaks the plastic heads The mallet is lower quality but works fine for tent stakes I find the dust pan useless and tossed it The carrying bag is average to below average For a cheap price if you need stakes and a cheap mallet this is a good deal Otherwise just buy the stakes separately 
Bought them extra because I am going camping and they where nice and good quality Bigger than I expected 
What you see is what you get The bag is a bit flimsy and grabs the broom as you put it in or pull it out Stakes hammer and puller make it worth it The broom is a bit small for a large tent I have an 8 person tent Hammer is a rubber mallet I to camp late and didnt make a bunch of noise banging on the stakes 
Very convenient and worked well I used the 4 stakes as replacements and main anchors to the cheap ones that came with my tent I then used the small ones that came with the tent as the secondary anchors I loved the tool that came in the kit to remove the stakes it worked amazing on both the standard stakes and the ones included in the kit The kids had a fun time using the broom to sweep up the tent as well The mallet worked as expected and overall this was an amazing little addition to our camping gear Id definitely buy Colemans stake kit next that comes with just the stakes as these were heavy duty and didnt bend like the issued stakes that come with the tent Super impressed 
nice compact tent for backpacking at a great price 
it handy having it all together the puller bends when you use it I broke the plastic on a stake the first time out pulling it good hammer I like the bag wish it wasnt mesh cause when you put the broom in it the fibers catch and have messed them all up all this sounds kinda bad but I would buy again its nice having it altogether just a little cheap 
Came in handy 
Essential for camping These stakes and mallet will plant your stakes well Get a large pair of vice grips and youll never have trouble removing them either 
If you buy a Coleman tent you MUST buy this tent kit The stakes that come with the actual tent are quite flimsy The rubber mallet came in super handy when I was camping in national parks I also appreciated the stake puller that was included as it made it really easy to pull the stakes out of hard ground I highly recommend this product 
Exactly how its billed Camping essentials I needed And theyre good quality tent stakes are stronger than what came with my tent I also like that everything is in a bag for storing in my gear box 
I bought a Coleman propane two burner grill stove The one with the blue lid The grill part of the stove is for barbecueing only If you want to fry eggs or cook bacon for example you need to buy this griddle to use in place of the grill It is custom made to fit this stove and it works great I tried using a flat griddle from the kitchen on the stove and it didnt work well So buy the griddle 
Excellent tent kit We used this with our tent when we went camping a couple months ago The stakes and hammer work very well 
Love this kit Before this we are always scrambling to find rocks to pound the bolts Not with this we use the mallet Its east to use Also the pully thing allow us to remove the bolts with ease I also use the duster to dust the inside of our tent before we move things inside Love the kit 
Everything is as pictured The little and I mean little dust pan was child size to sweep a toy play house 
This came with the Coleman outdoor stove we bought Worked great for cooking bacon outside while we were camping 
The feet are a little longer than I wanted but it does a great job 
I have the Coleman stove and needed a griddle I would normally drag out the big griddle for camping and its too big and one extra thing to carry Used this griddle this weekend and it was great for pancakes and frying eggs Its big enough to make 4 good sized pancakes Am glad I bought this 
Yup just what you expect used many times last summer and works great 
It is good camping stove I am using it on boat It is light compact and easy to operate Good power I do not like only absence of piezoelectric lighter 
This light portable Burner sits low and has a full size cooking area so you can place a metal cup or a 12inch pot on it The simple wind block system guarantees that you meal is evenly cooked and you never have an unseen blowout of your fuel The output of gas is easily adjustable with a ribbed knob Everything is heavy duty embossed steel for really strong and long lasting use plus the grate is coated with Nickel Chrome which make sit really easy to clean I purchased this over my Texsport Single Burner Propane Stove kit as that had small rubber base clips which were always falling off in the dirt Coleman makes the best camping gear and equipment by far 
This is a very easy product to use but note that it is larger than a small burner that I thought it might be I used it very easily the first night I had it out at the campsite and it worked to perfection without any troubles at all I would recommend this to anyone who does not need multiple burners or to those who do not camp all that often I camp out about 34 times per year and this will suit my needs quite well Only gave it 4 of 5 stars due to its bigger size but it puts out plenty of heat for my purposes 
I bought this stove primarily to use for emergencies or when I experience a power outage but I like that I can also use it for camping note it is not a backpacking stove its too bulky and propane is too heavy for that I was a bit surprised that the base is a lot larger than it looks in the online picture This stove can accommodate 12 and even 14 pots and pans While this may seem like a positive for me I wish it was slightly smaller At least it can be stored in a cupboard vertically I also wish the stove came with a carrying pouch or case but it does not The stove performs and functions perfectly well and seems sturdy and well built so all in all for the price Im happy with it despite the few negatives Ive mentioned Small propane tanks are cheap and readily available for about 150200 which is a real plus 
We bought a new coleman stove and thought a grill would make cooking outside easier This fits it perfectly Now we can make pancakes and other things on the griddle instead of a pan Much easier cleanup 
This griddle is specifically designed to work with a STOVEGRIDDLE model by Coleman ONLY If you use it on a Coleman StoveGriddle model stove it works great If you purchase this griddle to use on any other propane model Coleman stove it wont fit If you purchase this to use on a classic pump up liquid fuel Coleman stove it wont fit It is ONLY designed to work with a late model grillstove with two gas valves on far opposite sides It probably wont even fit the green colored early model grillstove with the two red gas valves on the same side All that being said you have been warned The griddle works great for pancakes eggs fish burgers sausage But if you plan to cook bacon youre going to have to deal with the grease while you are cooking There is not enough channel to catch the grade from one pound of bacon You will have to dump grease while you are cooking Be ready The only other issue is that this thing is made of aluminum If youre not cooking it can melt if left on the stove with a flame I dont know how the engineer that decided to make this thing out of aluminum instead of cast iron remains employed at Coleman That is just ridiculous While it does work its will melt easily if not watched or removed form the stove immediately after cooking 
Fits my coleman grillstove combo very well Great for breakfast in the morning 
If you get the Coleman Grill Stove you must get one of these With it you can to a great job on eggs bacon and pancakes all your basic camping food groups It fits well and cleans up easily 
Griddle fits nicely on the camp stove Not much room for grease to accumulate though 
Fit my Coleman stove as advertised and added new recipes when we are cooking in the rough 
Perfect fit 
Great 
Nice 
Everything worked as expected except the stake remover The metal just bends when trying to take out stakes The other items are as expected 
Its alright Ive found these grills are a little low on BTUs in the first place so that is automatically working against this griddle 
All the parts we bought to the coleman stove worked just perfectly Pancakes eggs sausage patties This is going to live in our permanent camp gear 
Met expectations 
This is an allaround great lantern for camping Its really bright when its turned up but in most cases you wont need that much so you can turn it down and expect quite a bit more time out of it But it is nice to have the extra brightness when you need it  I havent seen an electric one that can even come close Yeah the base can come off pretty easily but I dont mind it too much I only use the base when its sitting on something anyway right If Im carrying it around I just leave the base behind Often times I will hang the lantern up high to increase its lighting distance and I dont need the base in those cases either 
I keep this lantern handy for power outages I plan to take it camping next time I go I recommend keeping the Styrofoam case that protects the glass globe Its much easier to dismantle and store the unit without fear of breaking the globe This twomantle lantern throws out lots of light It starts easily with a match I dont like the way the propane tank sits in the base To move the lantern from one room to the next you must support the plastic base otherwise it falls off Very important Do not overtighten the top ventilator nut The glass globe will crack because it has no room to expand when it heats up I cracked two globes before contacting Coleman who showed me the error of my ways Despite the problems this is a great lantern and its much easier to use than Colemans pump version that uses liquid fuel UPDATE October 2011 I still use the same lantern for camping and power outages UPDATE February 2017 The lantern stills works beautifully Weve changed the mantle a few times but thats expected This Coleman still goes with us on every camping trip And despite the arguments I receive from some readers of my reviews we use this lantern indoors to light our way during a power outage The best part is that we never have to worry about deadweak batteries when a storm unexpectedly knocks out the power We keep a couple of propane tanks on hand at all times 
We went camping this weekend and finally got to use this new griddle It fit perfectly on the Coleman camp stove we have I like that the griddle is nonstick We made hamburgers and pancakes on it this past weekend and had no issues with sticking or burning The griddle cleaned easily also I was able to just use the nonabrasive side of the sponge with a little dish soap and wipe it clean The only thing I wish was different was the ledge I wish the back ledge was a bit higher because it was hard to flip pancakes and hamburgers on the small griddle without it falling off I almost lost a few pancakes This griddle is a great addition for our camp stove 
Works great 
worthless needs pan for grease to run into their are better products out there 
The griddle works great on my Coleman camping stove its a nice alternative works great highly recommended if you purchase or own a Coleman camping stove 
great set essential for camping 
Rubber mallet and stake puller are essential The large pegs are higher quality and longer that what I got with my tent and come in handy I thought dustpan and brush were frills but I wind up using it every time I go camping 
Good product 
Fits my Coleman like it was made for it Kidding Great product 
works great on the coleman stove 
Good 
We love this little replacement griddle for our Coleman stove INSTANT PANCAKES The only downside is that you have to take it off the stove when you clean up its too large to fit for storage 
great for eggs and pancakes Elements the need for a frying pan just remember to spray or use a non stick spray i use olive oil 
These lanterns are awesome I purchased this one to replace one I bought back in 2005 Great quality  
Amazing must have 
nice lantern nothing fantastic but good for price 
Quality lantern 
This comes in clutch for all the little things you dont think of Highlights Rubber hammer for driving stakes Tent broom Stake remover Carrying case Bottom line the whole thing rocks 
I am excited to use it camping I have not yet Looks like a good quality 
Great itembeautiful Thank you 
LOVE THIS Really makes pancakes so much easier while camping and I didnt have to give up my grill 
I love the griddle but hate that there isnt anywhere to store it I bought the leather case for this stove and it has two side pouches for propane but spot for my griddle Other than that Works great Non stick works good too 
Worked great 
k 
Way larger than expected 
Good and cheap and if you position correctly it will not tip over like one I used to haveI use for tailgating I wish it had some kind of screen to make it easier to light 
I tried it out as soon as i got it and its gonna be perfect for my needs 
Working fine 
Classic lantern Just like when I was a kid Worked great Very bright even on low setting 
What can I say it is a lantern sort of like the old Coleman fuel lantern but it burns propane Fairly bright the higher up you have the better it light the night Im nostalgic for the lanterns of old but I have to admit this version does everything they did No fuel to spill it burns great you can adjust the light output and it breaks down to a small size without the tank I set this up a home with the mantles packed it away and went camping at a campground with no electricity when night came and I wanted light out came the lantern On the first night when I turned down the light because I didnt need it at full throttle it whistled for about two seconds on low the next two nights it didnt make the sound at all A few things to remember folks this thing uses combustion to light it burns propane keep it away from flammable material it will get hot dont use it in an enclosed space and allow it to cool before putting in a tent for overnight storage Also those little battery lanterns headband lights and flashlights make better walking around the campground lights 
Good 
a 
Very handy 
solid 
super handy great quality little kit for camping The stakes are extremely sturdy as well as the stake puller The mallet is of good material and the broom and pan are super handy and small so they dont take up to much room 
great 
great 
Does the job 
This is a very good grill Bacon pancakes grilled cheese and toast all came out nicely The nonstick surface seems to be sufficiently thick but I did not use anything other than plastic or wooden utensils I also bought a new Coleman PerfectFlow Insta Start Grill Stove and this fits over the grill area when removed Note that it is 23 inches above the flame and seems to distribute the heat evenly over the entire surface of the grill I dinged this a star because it does not come with a cover or case and could be damaged if youre not careful 
Nice and heavy fit really well on camping stove 
The best light at the camp Someone had one of these last summer so I knew that I wanted one of my own Puts off very bright light and we were able to stay outside to play cards and games well into the night with this being our main source of light 
We used it last weekend for our camping trip and it worked great It gives out great light and the adjustable knob was perfect for adjusting for the evening light into the night Great 
did not last as long on high as advertised almost 13 less but is it bright 
this is very handy for camping it allows you another cooking surface turns on right away has nob for flame control and is easy to clean You should always have a backup bottle of propane  
Works perfectly lights easily We use it instead of the boats built in electric stove reducing the need to run the generator 
product as described 
WORKED GREAT 
Fits our Coleman stove perfectly Cant wait to use it 
Great addition to my stove can cook about 8 slices of bacon at a time Downside is the drain holes dont try to cook a bunch of scrambled eggs all at once like I did the eggs were running through the holes and overfilling the little grease pan on the bottom of the stove what a mess 
I used it on a camping trip last weekend and it seemed to heat uniformly and drained into the grease tray OK was easy to clean Wished the unit would close with the griddle in it 
I can cook so many things on my coleman stove thanks to this handy griddle One day I made chicken liver fried onions and bacon on it while on deck of my home which I am renting for a year thus my wanting a portable grill The neighbors loved the smell til the liver got on there  It cooks everything fast and perfectly Highly recommend for foods that could fall through grills standard rack 
We bought this for our coleman propane stove The original stove top warped when we were cooking pancakes I think we let it get too hot and the pan we used on top was the same size as the stovetop so there wasnt enough air flow This griddle was a great replacement for our coleman stove We have used it for cooking breakfast while tailgating and havent had any problems with food sticking on the griddle It cooks evenly and we havent noticed any hot spots 
Best thing we got for our Coleman GrillStove combo Wasnt a big fan of the grill thing unless you were cooking large slabs of meat or grilling sausages it was rather useless Now we use it to cook the bacon quesadillas burgers hot dogs grilled cheese sandwiches The possibilities are endless It cleans up easy too It goes with us on every camping trip now we leave the grill at home 
Was a great addition to my stove to allow more cooking versatility  you know bacon french toast and coffee on the same stove 
They bend easy 
Not worth it The only thing that worked well on my first time out with this kit was the mallet While the stakes held well I couldnt get one out and the puller tool was useless meaning it didnt work at all and it bent the first time out The stakes do have more hold than regular stakes and I had a sales person tell me thats what he uses but if you cant get them out what do you do I learned later you have to hit them on the side a few times to loosen them in the ground but I didnt know that when I tried to use this based on the description and almost had to leave one behind the first time out 
What you see is what you get nice little set You can put this together yourself cheaper from walmartif you dont have the time to do so but this one 
Got this as an impulse purchase but Im glad I ordered it The states are much better than the stakes that came with my Coleman tent The plastic tops are just a better method to secure the tent The brush and pan mallet and pulling hook were so very handy 
A definite must have if you have the grillstove when you are camping Makes great pancakes and scrambled eggs if you can get the picnic table level 
Not much to saybut this griddle worked great on my coleman stove Heated up fast and evenly It even has a builtin grease draining channel to move the grease to the end of the griddle and drop back into the spill area 
Functions as described very easy to clean be very careful what touches it though anything scratches the nonstick coating Great for breakfast 
Wonderful stove I run a 20 lb tank off it 
Perfect Heats up a 8x13 tray of italian beef in about 5 minutes Much better to purchase off Amazon as most other outlets consider it to be a bulk item and require more shipping 
For when the power goes out you can still cook in a big pot 
Very good affordable and bright lanternMine is either match or lighter lit but is easy to lightWhat more can you ask from a lantern 
My last years car camping trip I brought both a grill and a stove It felt like way too much equipment This year I decided to forgo the grill and just bring the stove but luckily the stove needed replacing I just happened to stumble onto the Coleman stovegrill combo and found it worked perfectly for my needs except the stove area was a bit small for pancakes and other things that needed a larger frying pan This griddle filled the bill You simply remove the grill grate and replace it with the griddle I also bought the case for the stove griddle combo and this griddle fits in the case with a piece of cardboard separating it so the griddle doesnt scratch the stovegrill Perfect package 
Fits my coleman perfectly and cleans up without scouring Perfect when I go camping Just be carefull not to break the legs off 
Great product high quality used the spikes for the corners of my tend and it held up perfectly even in the wind 
super nice 
Its not a flame thrower that boils water in 30 seconds but it is a decent side burner that will eventually get water boiled I tried to boil about 2 gallons of water and it took quite a while with this It is decent though Easy setup and lit right up No complaints other than it not being able to boil a lot of water fast 
Great little burner Used it for a week after Hurricane Irma 
Fraud 
Good product just what I needed 
I gave the stove to my girlfriend who was involved in Hurricane Irma and she is been cooking for her family on this one burner for a week now it has been very functional and very good She is very happy with the stove it was a lifesaver for she and her family after the hurricane They were able to eat tasty warm food when the alternative if they did not have the stove would have been miserable 
I havent use it yet but this was the only place I could find the one that fits my stove It seems heavy weight I hope the nonstick finish stands up to use 
I bought the Coleman Grill Stove because I do a lot of solo car camping and I wanted something more versatile than my backpacking stove but I was tired of lugging my Coleman RoadTrip grill for just one person I hate carrying and washing a lot of extra pots and pans while camping and I thought this griddle would allow me to cook up my breakfast  eggs bacon pancakes etc  all at once while minimizing the number of pots and pans Id have to wash It also comes in handy when grilling up smaller items like veggies shrimp or even fish The griddle heats up pretty quickly and evenly and the nonstick surface is great I always spray it with a little cooking spray which makes clean up extra easy Ive used it several times already and have never had a problem with anything sticking to it or burning onto the griddle and when I am done all I have to do is wipe it clean with a damp paper towel and give it a proper washing when I get home If I could improve upon this griddle at all I would just add a carrying bag or some sort of protective sleeve As others have commented you cant store it in the stove itself like you can with the grill plate because its too high so you need to carry it separately and I am always concerned about the surface getting scratched or one of the legs getting broken 
This is a very nice addition to my camp grill It is perfect for breakfast foods such as eggs bacon etcproduct shipped on time and intact 
This is an excellant unit for providing that home cooked breakfast while in the field I camp out 6 to 10 times a year and its cheaper than trying to find some place to eat every morning 
The Grill is great for eggs and the like when camping outdoors Clean up is little hard if water is not around or low on water 
Fit perfectly on the coleman grill Easy to cook on and easy to clean Seems to be very durable as well 
Best Lantern out Coleman 
Dont like the idea of using a match to light this but its good  
this is a great light for blackouts  
everything one could wish for in setting up an tearing down a tent 
the broom it too small to be useful But the hammer stakes and tool to remove stakes work just as intended 
Love it 
Great Product 
it is a bit larger than what I thought but it is very solid and handles my heavy Lodge dutch oven without any wobble Very nice and solid cooker 
Perfect for camping trips I used to haul around my twoburner stove but it was just so big and I wanted to downsize the amount of stuff I bring on our camping trip This works great Easy setup So much lighter than the Coleman twoburner stove Its also very stable I set this up on a boulder because we didnt have tables The stove didnt slide off the boulder Definitely recommend 
Worked great for camping Or for any other time youd need a larger burner 
its a hot one 
This was exactly what we needed to complete our cookout items for when we start camping this spring Cant wait for a great morning breakfast of pancakes and eggs 
Must have for your Coleman grill for breakfast cooking We make pancakes and bacon on this while camping Good buy 
I have a stove that this isnt supposed to fit  an old Coleman twoburner propane stove While it doesnt have a cradled area to put it it rests on the grill just fine and I havent had any issues with it We camp a lot and this griddle is perfect for biscuits pancakes eggs and bacon want to be careful about grease runoff on that one Its lightweight and packs away with our camp kitchen easily There are lots of options out there for griddles and this one isnt the universal solution but its a good one Its kind of hard to mess that up 
Got this for our Coleman grill It works great Rated at 4 stars instead of 5 just because I feel like it could be a bit cheaper or include a nylon case or something Would definitely recommend it to others 
The lantern I received is a bit crooked when screwed on to a gas tank And the stand cup it sits in isant wide enough  Not the same stand cup in the picture I dont even care though because it certainly works good and its bright enough with out the need to say I need more light 
This lantern is ideal for our use The item arrived on time and packaged very well I would recommend this for anyone needing a LP gas lantern 
Coleman quality and built to last 
I bought this to use on my tent for a wilderness trip I used these stakes instead of the ones that came with the tent but hitting them with the hammer the green hooks at the top broke and when I pulled the rest out with the hook the rest of the green parts broke off The stakes themselves did not bend or anything though The kit itself is pretty heavy so I would not recommend to take the hammer on a long trip where you are hiking I am going to try and find something liter for the next trip 
Perfect accessory for camping Having a broom and dustpan was very nice The mallet and stake remover a very easy to use 
came in handy I needed the extra stakes 
This is a really nice little kit that makes setting up a tent in rocky soil much less frustrating My only complaint is I wish it had included more stakes there are only four 
Works well except the flame doesnt go low enough It burns the bottom of my pots and pans and I cant cook rice with it 
Works as describe and useful 
Overall good product I wish it came with the case 
I was beyond impressed at how well this griddle worked I made pancakes eggs heated up bread and tortillas on it and everything was perfect Definitely a must to go along with your stove Easy to clean too 
Great accessory for my camp stove Now I can grill burgersbrats for dinner and fry up eggs  bacon in the morning on the griddleThe versatility of the stove cannot be matchedonly better if both were MADE IN USA 
if you bought a coleman grillstove you will definitely want this a must have for breakfast fits the 9922 
I bought this at the same time I bought the Coleman Stove After reading every single review I could Im very glad to have bought this It works really well on the stove especially if you have alot of different items you want to cook at the same time Its even handy at home I have a gas range and inspiration hit me I put the griddle on it and voila it works great My daughter used it to for pancakes Afterward it cooled down washed  dry and it should be ready to go for camping again Obviously on the stove the heat distribution is not the same just adjust acccordingly Definitely recommend this griddle 
I read the previous reviews before purchasing this item Reading the reviews made me skeptical Ill admit But I took a chance and purchased this item anyway It performed well by heating evenly with no dead spots and cooked my breakfast pancakes quickly and efficiently This item works well and I highly recommend this item to anyone who is considering making this a purchase item 

The product appears to be of good quality and fits nicely on select coleman grillsa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefColemanOutdoorGrillandStoveReddpB000BPEE4MrefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTF8Coleman Outdoor Grill and Stove  Reda But what the description does not tell you is that you will need to remove the grill grate usually greasy and replace it with the griddle  this is what I do not like I was hoping the griddle would just sit on top of the grate and then just remove it when I want to use the grill and I was hoping the entire grill could fold up with the griddle inside  No Way 
good 
True to the other reviews this gets the job done Extremely bright and super easy to assemble I plan to transport it in the original box for as long as I can Just cant see myself buying the plastic cover that wont hold any extras ie The butane canister 
Works like a champ 
in the bright day darkest night  there is no dark nights the first time we started this  it was so bright  that we thought we had a gas leak or something  but it was just that bright we were able to adjust the gas flow to reduce brightness we found a high branch  and guess what  it was as bright as a street lamp when we switched it off  it took about 5 mins or less to cool off keep the package  as it is useful to transport including the glass buy a spare lantern mesh for 25C at the local super market  and a lighter  and youre set amazing products put other peoples lantern to shame we got this for outside and electicy for inside the tent 
Working ver y good 
Was a gift 
Handy item 
I had to return it because the mallet arrived split in half Regardless the contents were poor quality except for the stakes But I can just buy a few of those at the local store for a couple of bucks 
Generates I bought this one burner propane stove for a very specialized need roasting green coffee beans in a cast iron skillet outside Due to the smoke that roasting coffee beans produce roasting inside is not an option so I roast on my deck and needed a heat source All you need to fire up the Coleman Powerpack is a small propane tank priced at 2 for about 7 I roasted green coffee beans today and the Powerpack generated more than enough heat to raise the temperature in the skillet to over 400F the optimal temperature for roasting coffee beans Delighted to have the Powerback for my coffee roasting hobby 
it does the tricknot for simmering a sauce but for skillet cooking and boiling its greati have noticed in pictures of the stove everybody sets the propane stove at the odd side angle try setting the propane bottle so the bottom sticks straight up in the airyou will find it sets flush on table and more stable which is how i think it was designed to do 
Good product Adjustable wrench and gas hose is needed The product picture is misleading I would rather have the collar as shown 
This is the ticket It does require a wrench to install to bottle unlike picture shows but no big deal This along with a hose will eliminate the 1 lb bottles all together 
Today I used a batterypowered pump purchased for under ten dollars at the grocery store of all places to inflate this for the first time It is true that it takes some guesswork to assemble the paddles correctly Basically the instructions dont explain that the closed end of the poles is where you attach the paddles this creates a seal and then water doesnt seep into the poles Anyway since it was the first time it probably took 10 minutes or more to inflate but the process was very simple The air chambers are numbered so you know which part to inflate first Its a little tricky closing the plugs without letting all the air out because it is built to deflate quickly My sisterinlaw made the smart decision of keeping the pump running and then quickly pulling it out and closing the plug In any case its very manageable Then we took it out into the pond on a day windy enough for whitecaps We could not believe how well it tracked It actually has two skegs which my quite expensive real kayak lacks The paddles do drip but again compared to my hundreddollar real paddle the price of this entire inflatable package they do an excellent job Just plan to get a bit wet bathing suit bottoms recommended My 82yearold dad who has been avoiding tippy canoes and cant get in my real kayak at all came with me and he LOVED it It was so nice to be able to get him back on the water again My sixyearold did not come with meit was really too windybut I tried both the front and back seats myself and I feel confident that she will be able to sit very securely in the front seat Even as the waves bounced us up and down the kayak felt very sturdy I really cant say enough good things about this kayak My only advice would be that if you plan to paddle alone often you might want to consider a singlethis one is surprisingly large One middleaged and one elderly thumbsup 
Always good to have extra pegs Strong metal but plastic will break and bend when trying to pull out of hard ground The peg pull device is a little weak and will bend with stubborn stakes Beat the stakes with rubber mallet to loosen dirt or drive the stakes in ground The broom is little use for clean up bristles get all mangled in mesh bag So far bag has held up to its usage 
Perfect items for the camper Tent stakes are a wee bit small for windy conditions but work just fine on normal weather It is very handy Watch for a sale though to get the best price 
Good experience 
came as described very good quality 
The stake puller bent the first time I tried to use it so that thing is pretty much worthless The mallet worked very well and was handy to have around the campsite The tent stakes worked well though I question the durability of the plastic at the top of the stakes and I wish the pack came with about 6 more stakes The broom is a broom We have a BIG Coleman Montana 8 person tent 16 x 10 if I remember right and it takes a little while to sweep out with the little broom but it did the job The carrying case held up through the first trip but its very thin mesh and I dont expect it to last much longer 
Trip was canceled 
Works like it should wouldnt add anything or take anything away 
Excellent product Works great 
Only used this burner once was very happy with quality stability and heat output Great for taking to local park for afternoon picnic of chili dogs with the grandkids 
Works well Great for power outage situations  and peace of mind in case we have another one 
I like it 
Well made durable stable Knob controls flame for even consistent heat at any position 
No flame control Basically you have HIGH and goes out Really hard to cook with gets pans way to hot 
The saw works well and is nice and shape The front blade anchor is somewhat flimsy but well worth the money 
a great big shout out to coleman once again they have done it this is a perfect saw we used it when we went camping last month and boy were we happy it might look like a light weight hand tool but it can keep up with the big boys and it is really light weight perfect even for me the little lady  and my 6 year old son too 
I purchased this for practical and nostalgic reasons  grew up family camping with one  liked the fuel flexibility and heat production Unfortunately this stove failed me on its fifth camping trip The regular turn valve no longer functions  basically I turn it on but it will not go out on its own This created a precarious situation camping  either wait for it to slow burn through an entire fuel tank or pull it out and blow the flame out manually  I ended up doing this I have another trip coming up at the end of this month  very irritated having to find a new stove after this one died after a year I DO NOT rec this in spite of being Coleman fan for family camping gear 
Nice 
needs a case for storage 
Another coleman excellent product If you camp you need this 
pain in the rear to light but when it gets up and running its extremely bright 
Ive been using Coleman propane lanterns since I was a teenager and Ive loved every one and kept most of them for years and years As much hassle as real mantels can be they emit the most pure and brightest light I can imagine Ive bought and owned several batternpowere lantern but none comes close to propane for sheer illumination If youre camping alone in a relatively remote area its nice to put this lantern on a rock or tree stump and have good vision for quite a distance easily 50 if youre burning on high power As someone else mentioned I think there needs to be a better way to attach the base though sometimes I just stick the propane tank in a pile of gravel or dirt and its pretty steady so that you can move the lantern quickly I also miss the tieon mantles though it took me a long time to get good at tying them I rarely use propane indoors but with winter coming here to New England I love having a super bright lantern like this to set out on the front step to make the neighborhood more cheery when the power goes away 
Mallet worked well broom and tent poles worked well Hook to remove tent poles was also very handy 
Not durable hammer camp apart before using it 
Used this for the first time this past weekend The little broom and dust pan worked very well and the mallet served its purpose as well 
what every camper who uses a tent needs 
Weve used this in calm and windy bays with two people and the dog sitting on a lap Scant storage Expect to get wet As many reviewers have said the oar locks are useless Weve used it twice a month for two years and its still going strong Weve no professional knowledge of kayaking we just want to get around and have fun I dont think Id rely on it for an extended trip but for day trips on the cheap this has suited us just fine Be sure to get the Coleman pump along with it Does the job quickly 
Simple stable brings the heat The feed tube tucks under 2 pot supports and the whole thing without the gas bottle but including a generous folding windscreen and piezo lighter fits exactly in a cloth bag Set it up on the tailgate and were cooking in no time 
Yes yes yes to this stove Easy to light and heat can be turned to a very low flame if the knob is turned gently and with a bit of finesse Loved it so much I got another one It is sturdy enough to hold a 12 cast iron skillet No more cooking over the campfire for us 
better than a stove Can fit large pans etc 
Great stove for camping Highly recommended 
Brought this while car camping as backup to our Dutch oven and thank goodness we did because there was a lastminute fire ban that prevented us from having wood fire or charcoal I was very impressed with this little stove it worked better than our 10000 btu stove and we had coffee and meals cook faster than on our old stove Keep in mind that it doesnt have a windscreen but we fortunately had one readily available Make sure to get a wind screen for those windy days We had massive gusts that blew our jackets off the chairs but still had our delicious hot cups of coffee to keep us warm 
Spend the extra money and get a Sealine dry bag This one is okay and cheap but thats it 
I recently purchased the Coleman Dry Gear Bag size Small  24 x 10 from Amazon for a 4wheeling trip to West Virginia As it turned out I didnt really need to use it but in case it rained I wanted to have it with me As usual the shipping from Amazon was speedy and I received the bag in under a week Unfortunately I wish I had taken more time to look at my local Bass Pro shop first This bag is around a 20oz bag which I found to be almost too small for what I neededwanted it for Its also a very stiff bag The little loops that are attached are nice as is the translucent seethru nature of the plastic But in terms of overall construction quality its not as nice as a 30oz bag I could have gotten locally for around 12 Honestly Im not 100 certain that this bag would be the best if there were a chance of it getting submerged or sitting in standing water After putting items in mine and rolling it I could still push air out That tells me the seal wasnt very solidcomplete Conversely I have a small a datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefSealLineBajaDryBagsSpring2010dpB0009RNVPArefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTF8SealLine Baja Dry Bags Spring 2010a bag that I can NOT do that on And the bag I tried out at Bass Pro could have doubled as a pillow with the way it held air In the end its caveat emptor You get what you are paying for with this bag If you are looking for something cheap and simple just to keep the rain or mud off of your stuff then this might be a good choice for a relatively low price But if you are looking for something that is more durable and airtight Id encourage you to take a look at some of your other options both on Amazon and at stores like Bass Pro or Cavenders 
I love these little Coleman stoves I bought this and the dual fuel lantern together They can run on standard Coleman lantern fuel or regular gasoline The cooking area is small this is the compact stove I can fit a smaller skillet on it and maybe something small next to it My griddle will encompass the entire cooking area of course The mechanisms work pretty well and it is very portable It isnt the quality of the old Coleman stoves but that is life 
Solid performer Ive had 3 of these since I was a kid The first is still with my parents The second one Ive had for 17 years The gas tank started to leak I couldnt find a replacement so I picked up a new one Works like a champ camping 
great light 
Did not dissappoint Thanks Coleman 
The lantern itself is ok however the first time I used it the legs broke off the stand causing the lantern to fall over and the globe to break I have replaced the globe but now I can only use this as a hanging lantern 
Bright 
good 
Mallot and stakes are reasonably good quality The broom and dust bin are very small and seem flimsy I do like the stake pulling tube and it really helps retrieving stake from hard ground Overall I would buy separate broom and dust bin 
Nice and handy little kit 
Standard tent kit with a nice carry case 
There wasnt a need for it The product looks fine but we can do with out it 
We used the mallet and the tent stakes The broom and dust pan were too small and no one wants to get on their hands and knees to sweep out a tent Stakes were good sturdy and useful 
Great Thanks 
Does the job 
Very poor control over burner output makes it hard to use for anything other than boiling water It is very difficult to simmer cook pancakes etc due poor low range Limited compatibility with small cookware4 diameter 
I like to camp but Im not what you would call an avid camper I usually go tenting with my family about two to three weekends a year I did not really purchase this stove for that purpose even though Im sure it will come in handy I purchased this stove for emergency use Things like if the electric goes out government takeover you know the whole conspiracy crazy agenda end of world stuff LOL After looking up a TON of reviews I ended up buying two of these stovesburners I couldnt be happier after testing These stoves light easy heat fast easy to clean and will hold big pans with ease I also think they are much safer than a lot of the stoves Ive looked at It is true that they do not have a windblock but that is a easy fix if you have half a brain to set up something if you are using outdoors Another thing about these is in a pinch and even though not recommended they are a source of heat These babies put off some nice warmth Again make sure you have a carbon monoxide detector if you choose to do that but again they can serve that purpose in a major crisis What really sold me on this burner was the youtube video I am linking on here  Even though the YT video is somewhat cheesy and long this guy went through the gambit with testing this stove from boiling carbon dioxidemonoxide temperature etc After all of the reviews he literally sold this stove to me Coleman needs to pay whoever this guy is Anyways just get the stove In fact get two if you are a prepper for a backup and for an extra source of heat if in a critical situation 
performs as it should 
Hard to find propane adaptor I used this adaptor to attach the female end of my propane extension line to my 20 lb propane tank instead of attaching to the one pound throw away propane bottles Think of it as a coupler between a 20 lb propane tank or larger and a propane extension line 

Good product but not using at this time 
Easy to install 
great product and works perfectly 
Nice size light weight stove Perfect for camping and tailgating Fuel tank wont sit straight otherwise a 5 rating 
I Really dont know how well this works since it is stored away for power outages Looks like it will be fine 
Not sure what I did wrong but I had fuel come out the spout and it pooled into the casing and then the entire thing caught on FIRE I followed the instructions on the label but I think I forgot to lower the tiny lever I wish the instructions explained what each step and part was for in detail Either way I had to shovel sand over it and put it out While the other groups we camped with had no issues with a propane stove which we ended up borrowing the use of FYI this only gets to 9K btu while overs can go to 25K with propane Yes this fuel lasts longer but Im not cooking a pot of some long process soup I just need my coffee water to boil ASAP And its not even cold out yet Wait til I go camping when the mornings are cold Will surely need something strongerJust kinda wondering if Im missing out on some great feature that this got almost 5 stars Btw if the flames got any higher the dry branches above would have caused a forest fire it got hot enough to melt the rear rounded footing shape into my folding table and hot enough for some sap to melt on top There should be a nice fuel use write up someplace for how this fuel maybe useful or limiting to the time and what you want to heat up FYI I used the recommended Coleman Fuel I either clean this thing up and try it again or get rid of it for a propane stove 
We bought these bags to use on a canoe trip to protect our gear It turns out weve ended up using them for our regular boating trips when we want to assure that anything water sensitive cameras phones etc are protected They are nice and firm not too mushy I really like that they are clear so we can see whos items are in which we have several The yellow tabs are lashing tabs and we use those when on canoe trips to make sure they dont get away You can use a Carabineer to lash and remove them easily or run a rope right through under the tab This bag is pretty small and good for small items such as cameras a wallet and other small electronics If you want to put some clothes and a towel in too try the larger 29x13 bagnbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefColeman29x13DryGearBagdpB0009PUT70refcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTF8Coleman 29x13 Dry Gear Baga Thatll give you enough room to have what you need and roll the top down to seal the bag too The sizes are before closing so by the time you close it up theres less space than anticipated 
I took this and one of the large size ones down the Colorado River on a canoe trip These are not the heaviest weight out there but fine for casual user Further the ability to see through bag is really handy 
Found to be a superior product for the money Had a surprise of the size of the bag as I expected something smaller Will come in handy for storing valuables Great product A quick and easy small BOB 
This bag is great for the beach or boating I holds my 2 large beach blankets binoculars wallet and MORE This was a smart purchase 
Works on a small propane bottle AND atop a distribution tree for bulk bottles with careful threading for home emergency backup Have only tested it at home so far but have seen no reason to believe that it will perform any differently in the field Will probably buy another one Update Tried it out on top of a distribution tree once Threading was tricky  care must be taken not to crossthread Months later attempted to demonstrate to a neighbor and the cheap plastic valve unit acted as if it had been superglued shut The plastic knob turned but valve would not open The booklet that came with it does have a parts list with illustration but the valve is not replaceable Its junk 
Works as well as any other two burner propane lantern After trying the PerfectFlow valve I dont like it as well as the plain old screw valve The PerfectFlow valve is a fourposition valve off low medium high I can see where the inexperienced user might like that I prefer the fine continuous control of a screw valve which allows me to dial the light very low to be an all night nightlight You cant do that with the PerfectFlow valve Other than that this is a typical two burner propane lantern 
So BRIGHT Worker well in high wind and stable with the included base Very good fuel economy 
Not as good as my old one This thng seems flimsier than the one I bought years ago It also makes a bad whistling sound if it is not on high enough I kind of expected more from Coleman Update 616I called Coleman to complain about the whistling First they tried to tell to change the mantle which I had already done Then they said to let it run for a while before I turn it down This is the exact situation that CAUSES the problem not solves it Then I was told there was nothing else so I asked to speak to a supervisor At this point they agreed to send a replacement They asked for a picture of the lantern and a copy of the receipt and I happily complied However this was now not good enough They needed a number that they sent written on the coleman logo which is on glass They failed to mention that I needed to write on the glass specifically Who writes on glass I took the time to write the number they requested on masking tape and taped it to the lantern When I sent in that picture I was told it was unacceptable I am not a happy customer right now They make you jump thru too many hoops to get the product covered I have been a big coleman fan and I suppose I will continue to be but this was not good So I am decreasing this lantern from 3 stars to 1 
I have used this for 6 months on a daily basis I have a 20 lb propane tank that I hook the stove up to I have a windscreen and a heat diffuser 
Now this is worth writing about Have had other stoves and this one is far and away the best Easy to use and am able to precisely adjust the flame 
I was anticipating this burner to be smaller than other coleman burners I didnt anticipate how large it is If youre looking for a single burner then this is for you Because of its size it looks really stable Stability is important too as the propane tank is attached to the side of the burner You dont want the burner flipping up when you take the pan off and this looks like it will definitely stay put Colemans burners are quite reliable especially if you are using the throwaway coleman propane canisters Highly recommended I sent this back though because I was looking for something smaller 
great 
Everything seems to be here looks good I have not tried it yet 
Great stove The liquid fuel stove is described by a few people as a little cumbersome troublesome to light and obsolete The propane stoves are great they burn hot and they go through propane rather quickly Not bad they have their purpose and you can link them up with a large propane bottle For a shelter in place or base camp situation if you dont mind lugging around the large bottle no problem The liquid fuel Coleman however very transportable can run long enough on a tank of fuel to cook up a pot of beans and theres no small or huge propane tanks to lug around Yes they do need you to fiddle with them a little to light them but if you werent gadget savvy to begin with its real doubtful youd be going to the woods anyway These stoves and this is my second one the first one only lasted 30 years is also good to use with the Coleman folding ovenmeaning you can bake bread or goodies while out in the bushand that is really nice 
This stove is the exact same thing as the one my dad used when I we went camping as a family That one kept trucking on and on for decades This one is just as good Easy to set up light use and clean Heats pots pans etc in a jiffy I burn Coleman fuel and one full tank lasts for meal after meal without having to refill This is essential camping gear Having a hot meal on cold nights and mornings makes a huge difference especially if you dont have a campfire 
Good Coleman product 
Not as bright as others but it works well 
works as expected 
GREAT PRODUCT 
Does the job as expected 
Works as intended 
High quality brass fitting to use the accessory hose with a standard sized propane bottle like the sort you would use with a gas grill or a camper This is great to have on hand for emergencies too 
well done 
ok 
Just what one expect from a Coleman product 
There is nothing like the feeling of control when you can easily fill your empty super convenient onepound propane cylinders with the 30pound cylinder sitting around This thing works without troubles solid precision and well worth every penny 
Great product to use while camping allows for the bigger canister to be used 
This is a great boat In its deflated form it can fit under a modestly high bed or in a closet With a pump it inflates in about 5 minutes It isnt too heavy though might be a bit much for a child It wont go fast but goes faster than you might think On calm water it is surprising easy to power and maneuver The going gets rough with even a little bit of current The paddles come in sections that you screw together They are adequate for calm water Buyer Beware for stronger current I was recently paddling against a minor current in Biscayne Bay and one of the plastic pieces where you place your hands snapped in two Fortunately the person in front wasnt too heavy as I had to use their paddle to get back In summery great convenient boat but dont depend on the paddles 
My wife and I took this Coleman inflatable kayak out for the first time today on Lake Ray Hubbard in the DFW area I received it Wednesday in a very compact box and inside it had the kayak instructions and 2 kayaking oars that came in 7 pieces each These went together quickly and come with collars that separate each oar into 3 pieces for easy transport and storage When I unfolded the kayak for the first time I was really amazed at just how big it is Im 62 and my wife is 57 Both of us fit very comfortably and there is probably enough leg room for someone up to about 66 or so to feel really comfortable There is a storage area in the front and the back thats triangular in shape We brought along some snacks and drinks in a plastic bag but Id be willing to bet you could get a small cooler in there as well As for performance on the water it worked better than I had expected We launched from the shore over some floating debris and the sides barely displaced 2 of water with a combined weight of 320 between us It was very stable to get into and out of because its wide and has seems that allow the side air pockets to pivot and stay still while the bottom moves as you move around It was a little slow over the water because of the same width and its also because of the width that I have my only gripe The included oars are a bit short for the size of this boat which means you are going to get wet if you plan on getting anywhere in a decent amount of time you are forced to swing the oars over so far that the opposite oar drips right on top of you We did encounter some boat wake and it took that no problem straight on and at an angle I would not be surprised if it even took a parallel wake without flipping It just feels that stable I wouldnt recommend taking it out in a lot of chop however the kayak does move and gyrate a whole lot when you encounter different levels of water Blowing up and packing couldnt be any easier I bought an Ozark Trail large volume hand pump from Walmart to make my life easier and I was able to fully inflate the kayak in just over 6 minutes from empty There are numbers on each of the 8 valves that tell you the order to inflate in Deflating for me was as easy as undoing all of the valves and rolling the kayak one way then unrolling and rolling the other way It collapsed on its own to a size small enough for even the smallest trunk I expect to get a lot of use out of the kayak this summer Its very fast to set up and a lot of fun just remember that the oars are going to get you wet 
great 
Worked great on our camping trip 
Nice for clean up 
Only 3 stars because the steaks and steak puller dont work They suck Buy a Hamer and broom somewhere else 
A must for any tent 
Love this burner holds large pots with no problem 
Works like a charm Very compact while still being able to support a full size pan without fear of it tipping over and accepts the common larger 164 ounce bottles Puts out enough heat to cook unless its very windy if the wind is high you need to find a windbreak but that is better than some camp stoves that even a slight breeze and you will use a full fuel bottle and your food will still not be cooked 
handy tool for camping but doesnt really crank out the heat 
Great product 
great o0ne 
Id put this stove up against any camping stove Small enough to pack but big enough to put large pots or skillets on Works on camping fuel or unleaded gasoline Works great 
I just tried this out and I like it BUT I do want to answer the people that could not get it lit I couldnt either Until I watched a youtube video It seems the instructions arent very clear about opening up the priming pump It says to turn it to open and hold your thumb over the end when I did this I couldnt push it in and pump After watching the video I finally realized that I wasnt turning the end to the open position It must be turned counter anti clockwise about 3 times before it is truly open Only then can you hold your thumb over the hole and prime it 30 times once I did this it fired right up So dont think its going to break because you feel tension when turning it to open it just use some force on it when turning it to open and then it works great Also remember to slowly release the pressure when undoing the filler cap or it will explode gas out 
Excellent for picnic and camp day Must be careful whit gas and fill 
Works perfectly Even the Arctic Circle 
pleased 
nice stuff 
fast and easy works great would buy again 
When setting up a tent for camping you almost always need a few extra tent pegs a mallet to hammer them in with a forked hook to remove them when taking the tent down and a broom for sweeping dust out of your tent And that is exactly what you get in this handy little kit which a great addition to any tent on the market I sometimes prefer a regular hammer over a rubberized mallet for nailing down pegsbut the included mallet worked fine for me and was quieter to boot So far this kit is working great with my eight man tent and I hope to have it for many years Five stars 
Its ok didnt probably need them since the tent we bought comes with everything 
I havent found much if anything that Coleman makes that isnt decent The only thing I might complain about is having to buy the case separate but there are options to buy the case with the lantern but they are more than I think they should be 
This was exactly what it said it was Worked fine etc no issues Bright light Coleman quality This is the type of lantern that I grew up with Im giving three stars for the technology rather than the product I have LED lanterns and all things equal I prefer LED technology Battery vs gas Both use a consumable but the good LED lanterns have a very long battery life and can be more compact Your call but Im going LED even though the gas lantern is much much brighter For my purposes I dont need that much light for regular camping and power outages 
I really didnt want to switch to propane but once i got the refilling device for propane cans I made the leap and it was awesome Great lighting lasts a long time all without the Coleman fuel hassles Definitely recommend to those that will refill their cans If youre not gonna do that stick with the Coleman fuel please 
Very good 
Very useful i bougth the wrong one but fix it buying an adapter works great for refilling my 1 pound coleman gas can Fast shipping 
Easy and quick install No leaks Worked like a charm Wish it would have come with something to cover the threads 

Bigger than expected nice quality works well 
ok 
this is the 2nd one that I have the 1st ong was bigger I hane not used this yet but im sure it will work like the other one I have They do work well and with propane if you have the adaptergas does work in this stove 
I used one of these stoves for my everyday cooking for about 6 years straight in a mobile home at the coast I know ur not supposed to use them indoors but I didnt have a problem in that drafty trailer It was so economical I dont go camping but I wanted a reliable stove for emergencies earthquakes blackouts etc I dont remember what happened to my stove that I used back then so I just purchased a brand new one at Wally world for Ouch 99 Put Coleman gas in it and it fired right up with a beautiful blue flame It might be a bit lighter than my unit I was using 25 years ago but thats OK I just might get a lantern too and do some camping I will only use Coleman fuel in my stove but its nice that I can use regular unleaded gas if needed 
This is a great classic stove You can use camp fuel or unleaded gas I bought it for use camping and also for hurricane season When the power goes out and youve got to cook what was in the fridge you need something to cook onwith Weve used Coleman stoves for years and the build quality on this one looks similar to our older stoves I hope it will hold up as well and as long as some of our other stoves 
I bought this inflatable kayak primarily because several local adventure races require softsided boats It turns out to be one of the best 100 purchases ever and Im using it much more than I had originally thought I love the ease of rolling it up tossing it in the car trunk and being ready to hit the water almost anywhere Ive used it in the Gulf of Mexico in the bay and little inlets and it handles pretty well even with a nonpaddling passenger Its a fun way to poke around the wetlands do some birding etcwith its shallow draft you can paddle in literally inches of water Because it is wider and flatter than most kayaks the wind will push it a bit but its fairly responsive and maneuverable even fully loaded Definitely spring for the rechargable inflator which does the job in less than five minutes The paddles could be better but theyre OK for the money This kayak is a great option for someone whod like to paddle sometimes but doesnt want the hassle of storing a kayak strapping it to the roof of their car or dragging it to a launching spot The price works out to be about the same as just a couple days of kayak rentals and it opens up so many possibilities of kayaking where there arent any rentals 
Very nice complete camping dining set Good quality Will make your outdoor dining experience by the camp fire a lot classier than just using paper plates The flatware comes in a nice nylon wraparound holder with compartments for each piece It would be nice if Coleman also offered some kind of backpack or duffle bag designed to hold the dishes and mugs that would make a really nice kit or gift set 

A musthave for coleman tents 
The plastic on the ends of the stakes breaks off easily and the extractor deforms when you try to pull the stakes out of dirt Its not expensive and compact Gets the job done but lighter and more durable choices exists I would buy it again 
Pretty good kit for the price The stakes are very nice and durable We also like the broom dust pan and rubber mallet These pieces we as expected And the stake puller makes for easy and quick removal of the stakes Weve used our tent twice now and have not experienced the pulling tool bending out of shape like some have reported My only gripe is the mesh bag Who was the genius that thought a mesh bag was the best way to house pointy stakes Its a minor inconveinince but one nonetheless They constantly snag when trying to get them out and its only a matter of time before we have large holes in the bag All in all were happy with our purchase though 
A little small and mickey mouse but otherwise usable hammer good broom useless 
I cant believe how bright this lantern is Better then a 60 watt bulb and fun to use I was thinking of ordering another one 
I originally gave this three stars factoring in price to quality This is definitely a case of you get what you pay for The Spring mantles InstaClip Mantles seemed easy enough just make sure that you overlap them the correct way giving you the tightest fit You will not find the proper image on amazon do a search Google Coleman InstaClip Mantle 2Pack Since I have been active in Boy Scouts recently I planned on replacing my white gas products like mynbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefColemanTwoMantleDualFuelPowerhouseLanterndpB00006IS32refcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTF8Coleman TwoMantle Dual Fuel Powerhouse Lanternanbspandnbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefColeman2BurnerDualFuelPowerhouseLiquidFuelStovedpB00006I56JrefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTF8Coleman 2Burner Dual Fuel Powerhouse Liquid Fuel Stoveanbspwith propane I thought it would be better using the propane instead of worrying about white gas My reasoning for this is it would be safer to carry propane tanks in place of white gas and make life easier Anyhow I was wrong my Dual Fuel Powerhouse lantern more than double the price is a much better built lantern and I carry anbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefNewPrimusFuelBottle15LP732531dpB002HPMD9MrefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTF8New  Primus Fuel Bottle 15L  P732531a This is plenty of fuel and will last 5 days under light use Refilling is easy enough and you should use one of thosenbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefColemanFilteringFunneldpB0000AS5QBrefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTF8Coleman Filtering Funnela I sometimes just pour it into the lantern from the fuel bottle The control knob feels very cheap on the propane lantern and there are sort of preset clicks for different levels of intensity this is a nice feature the globe seems pretty hefty Its fairly well built but I would worry about the footing that slide out possibly breaking off The propane tank sits tight inside the base I will most likely donate this to the Boy Scouts with mynbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefColeman2BurnerDualFuelPowerhouseLiquidFuelStovedpB00006I56JrefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTF8Coleman 2Burner Dual Fuel Powerhouse Liquid Fuel Stovea If you plan on replacing a liquid gas lantern with propane Dont  unless you plan to use this for Scouts You may be disappointed however I would highly recommend this item for anbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefStansportDistributionPost2Piece30in3OutletdpB005EUE1IIrefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTF8Stansport Distribution Post  2 Piece  30 in  3 Outletanbspor anbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefCenturyTwoPiece1830Type1SafetyPostwithBagdpB0007LQ26SrefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTF8Century TwoPiece 1830 Type 1 Safety Post with Baganbspbut as a primary lantern that will get hung in a tree placed on the ground placed on a picnic table etcI suggest spending the extra cash and getting a Dual Fuel Lantern I hope this was helpful UPDATE 20131022 Used this on a recent COPE trip with the Boy Scouts and worked well the base worked fine I really hate to mothball my gasser but for Scouts this is much more practical I will be ordering a Propane tree and will update again I updated my rating from 3 stars to 4 for the simple fact that it does what it is intended to do and its a fair price for what you are getting I keep the Gasser when camping in the trailer UPDATE 20150222 I mentioned earlier in this review about the presets being a nice feature However after my most recent trip I am not happy with the presets Using this in a tent please no comments on using in a tent on our winter camping trip I realized the presets suck the lowest setting was too low so the next click up was too bright we tried running on the lowest setting but it let out a horrible whistling sound This is still a decent lantern but proved to be a bad choice in our 8 man tent I have since opted to order thenbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefPrimusMicronLanterndpB00EE67FVSrefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTF8Primus Micron Lanterna I will review this later I left the rating for 4 starts because these cons will not apply to most folks 
I really like all the Coleman lanterns especially the two mantle I thought I was getting the automatic light one which I like the best but it was my mistake I have these lanterns at my horse stable one in the camper and three at home for backup in case of a power outage Theyve all performed very well except style not this one has a base that falls off if you hang it by the handle You can also adjust the light output by turning the dial Easy to light with a match But if youre not comfortable with that get the one that lights with a turn of the dial Amazing 
Easy setup no issues Low heat may be a little high but it could have been just me I need to spend more time on the grill but overall I was very happy with it It will be coming back to Coachella with me next year 
Ive found the stove to be excellent It takes up very little room flame control is great and is very stable for the different sizes of the cooking utensils 
Had this same style for 30 years and it finally started to leak around the seal Bought this one and its as good as the old one Hope it lasts another 30 years I like that you can fill with gas or white gas vs the propane throw away canisters Much move environmentally friendly 
What is there not to like it cooks as it should 
Only way to go if you need steady constant heat to cook 
Great for on the go 
This has worked great for my last 3 camp outs Uses propane very slowly The only complaint i have is the stupid warning label is technically illegal to take off but if you dont it eventually will burn to the glass of the lantern if you dont 
Want to make night turn into day in about 30 seconds Get one of these A propane tank lasts for hours Some might consider is a little noisy I dont But if you crank the gas all he way you can hear the propane flowing through 
The Coleman two mantle propane lantern is another product in the high quality line of Coleman products Lights easily and burns well Ideal for indoor and outdoor use especially in emergencies Propane tank is easy to install and readily available from several retail outlets 
Not much to rate here it works properly and is somewhat effecient on gas when moderately illuminated I acheived almost 5 hours with goin full bore If it came with a case for the price5 stars then 
i bought this because I thought the propane tanks would be a little more portable and easier to use instead of messing around with fuel And it does have these advantages but while it is on it is really loud but it works well and is convenient 
Must have kit 
everything worked excellent the broom seems to be poor quality and i expect it to only last a few trips 
I dont know if this was a necessary purchase but it was very high quality and I am glad to have it in my kit The broomdustpan is probably the most useful and the stakes are good as well I keep it in my camping kit now and its good to have around 
The mesh bag seemed cheap  the mallet was Not that well built but not too bad considering the price point 
good quality mallet the mallet is solid and has a nice wood handle the stakes are good and segmental overall great little kit 
Exactly what I was looking for 
Love this stove It is what I now use I use this even for cooking for a large group It really fits larger pans and kettles This is not for backpacking however The no wind shield is a bit of a problem but I used the box the stove came in for a while large water bottles bags of supplies or what ever Now Ive made a metal shield that can be used around it They need to make a folding screen for this The stove itself heats fast It is a bit tricky to get low heat settings however Over all after using the usual Coleman or other brands of the two burner folding stoves I much prefer this stove Pack small and works better with all size pans 
I bought this to reach my parents 40 year old dual burner which is still working fine This just takes up less space and I rarely need to cook more than one thing at a time when camping Easy to use and easy to pack and store 
Great Item to have for camping or if power goes out Coleman Quality 
This is great Its convenient and easy to use The thing I like most is the wire grate will fit a large skillet or pot and hold it securely over the flame 
Excellent  Item delivered on time was as described great customer service 
what can be said the classic icon of camping since the war and i am talkin WW2 have used these for over 50 years and they are the bomb 
this is a great back up for when the electric goes out and of course for camping too 
Handy kit 
Came in a timely manner The broom is not quite as large as I was expectinghoping but it is functional for the purpose of its purchase 
This really is big I thought too big when I got it I bought to use while river rafting httpwwwamazoncomgpproductB0015VS5RS It put the latch through the oar locks on the raft and its perfect It holds a lot for the family of 4 towels clothes and lunch 
Excellent stove Especially for making larger more complicated meals 
I bought this as a back up for our pop up camper It is great light weight and easy to use 
A name long in camping stove excellence 
If you are a camper or prepper you really need one of these All it takes is one power outage and this pays for itself Remember this is only to be used outside 
Read the reviews and decided the negatives ones didnt apply so I purchased Product is great 
Its Coleman Its dual fuel ready to be as flexible as possible Parts are readily available from the big box stores or the momnpop locations should you ever need replacement parts Great camping piece or backup for the SHTF scenariopreppers 
The lantern has been successfully used in hunting expeditions It has been knocked down several times yet it has not failed Propane tank and bottom plate make it portable practical and safe 
Me and some buddies go camping once a year and I the camping guru would always bring the battery operated bulb lanterns Well this past year a friend brought along one of these and the difference was staggering If you turn that dial as high as it goes you can practically simulate daylight He put it on a stand and we were able to spot a snake that was ironically closest to my lantern Needless to say I purchased one of my own the first chance I got I prefer this model to the selfignition version due to the fact that the more handson something is the more proficient one becomes in using it Also it will be easier to spot when something is wrong with the unit this way The last thing one wants to discover is that something has rendered their lantern useless that could very well have been predicted and fixed before the next outing Insofar as the base goes I have done away with the flaps that come with it and fashioned my own out of a paint can I sprayed it with Rustoleum and then cut a hole in the top to barely accommodate the propane cylinder and flared out the base in order to create a near indestructible base that weighs practically nothing and can be strapped to the outside of a pack without worry about rust I also went so far as to keep a carabiner on hand to attach to the handle and along with some 550 cord I am able to affix it to any tree should the need arise This has come in handy for those times when I have lost a race against the sun and still have a couple miles to go before making it the distance I had planned to travel for the day before resting When these times strike I attach it to a propane hose and keep the tank in my backpack to better accommodate the weight so I can keep the light held high for longer I have even from time to time attached it to a stick to hold out before me to better show the terrain and judge elevation better I keep another one at home permanently affixed to a hose w a stand along with some 20lb propane canisters for whenever the weather knocks out power Ill have a strong light source to keep working and have even used it to show my way when shoveling snow at night To the point This lantern is one of those purchases that will always come in handy It can be used for emergency home situations and outdoor alike Keep an eye on the mantles and when they go on sale stock up You may never need all of them but they will at least be around in case you do Finally a word of WARNING This lantern can get hot enough to ignite or melt nearby objects For this reason it would not be very safe to use in a tent or around combustible items I have seen people pinched in an emergency use this as a tent heater needless to say Id have to be in a very difficult situation before I attempted going down that same route I definitely wouldnt fall asleep in a tent with this on 
Easy to use well made Helped me to live through several winter power outages 
I bought these for minimal camping gear One for a Jeep and one for my truck Heats up everything so darn fast Grate sits close to fire so small wind doesnt effect it It would be nice if it had a built in instant lighter but not a deal breaker I put a butane lighter in the box I made for the stove 
Hotter than my stove at home very large and stable runs great off my 5 gallon barbeque tank not into the expensive 1 pound disposibles  bad for the environment my opinion great stove wishedl bought this years ago good job Coleman  
Much larger than I thought and its very sturdy I put all my cast iron pans on it and they fit great even my large skillet and square griddle Their are many different kinds of camp stoves but this is one of the most compact for a full size grill and used the cheapest fuel about 250bottlewalmart which will last about 3hrs a piece I use one for camping and one for melting lead and casting bullets and it works very well for that You wont be disappointed so enjoy 
Just as durable and well built as older units but now I can burn unleaded if need be 
Read the instructions Worked very well Burned clean cooked fast with Colman fuel I didnt try straight gas I would only use straight gas in an emergency 
Worked great for the first few times but already having some issues with it Cant get rid of the yellow flame unless both burners are on Havent had a chance to really dig into the issue yet so not sure how easily it is solved or how helpful costumer service will be 
This is the same camp stove my family used back in the 1960s and 1970s but improved for dual fuel No highpressure propane cartridges to toss out UPDATE 2018 After 8 years the stove still works like new Ive run both white and regular gasoline in it without any troubles 
These are bright and cheery to use while camping Love em 
it gets nice an hot I use it for melting my lead down I do this outside so I need some BTUs this thing cranks Nice and hot 
nice stable base good flame controle 
As advertised 
Pretty decent set but the mallet is stinky rubber Ive got it airing out on my porch until I next go camping 
Worked well on test run with unleaded fuel have this as back up when tshtf 
I love this dual fuel burner Again I can use unleaded gas from the nearest station to our campsite and not have to carry it during the trip in the car 
the quality shows Very nice product for the money Nice to take camping to have for the outside cook projects Havent fired it up yet but I can tell the good old fashioned Coleman quality is still there Well we went on an extended camping trip and the stove did not operate at all well Flared up with a yellow flame tried pumping it up to no avail I have owned several of these stoves through the years and this one is a true lemon Changing my rating down to one star I am going to see if it can be returned for a replacement BTW I was using a new can of the real deal Coleman fuel 
This is a rugged stove that works with gasoline and or Coleman fuel I have had it for some time now and have had no issues I use it to go off road camping in my Jeep and it rattles the stove to death but it always lights up Great buy 
Nice one burner stove Easy to set up and heats a pot fast It would be nice if it came with a storage bag The gas pipe does not store inside the stove so you need to pay attention so you dont loose it 
unless you have a potpan that fits within the metal wire that the pot sits on then this will frustrate you as your pot will sit cockeyed and not cook evenly I wish I had purchased one that has a flat wire for my pot to sit on Otherwise this is great it heats up fast and is easy to use 
Simple to put together and use It heats very quickly great for cooking any meat boil water and such I recommend it 
I wanted a simple stove that is more stable than the ones that attach to the top of the propane tank and this is it 
I know that many places propane is very easy to get and is very cheap however in California it is much easier to get gasoline since homes arent heated with propane Propane costs about 3x as much as gasoline per gallon and gasoline puts out some serious heat I was able to get both burners started first try without issue and they both get going nicely once it is up to temperature 
Love the Coleman brand The set is excellent 
easy way to set up tent and tear down 
Another great coleman camping product Its always nice to have extra stakes The stake mallet held up all of last camping season and is working on season 2 The stake puller is also holding up for season 2 The broom and dustpan are probably similar to something you can find at the dollar store but works fine 
Okay I grew up with one of these stoves always nearby My family used them for Car Camping Snow Camping and Power Outages You arent going to be carrying one of these when Back Packing Needless to say I have a lot of experience and memories with and of these stoves This stove is as good as any of the old ones I ever used Need I say more than that Its easy to light and control It also cooks well 
yes this particular stove has a lighter gauge metal case than the older one I had handed down from my grandfather but it is also less expensive than the better model However it works as advertised and with care I expect to be giving this to my grandson In my opinion this is by far a better alternative to propane bottles as the fuel is readily available Armed with both my dual fuel stove and Lantern I am ready for camping or the possible power outages that might occure its comforting to have these reliable devices for any need 
This stove has a thousand uses If you lend your old one to a friend who is going cross country to get back to nature you will never see it again They will never return it because theyll learn to cherish it as you once did Dont mourn dont argue just accept its loss as inevitable Youve learned a valuable lesson Helping friends takes sacrifice Without this stove your buddies could have starved to death You can always get another stove right here 
It came as advertised It was even tripleboxed No dents no damages AND it was 35 dollars less than Wally World Whats not to like about it 
Very cheaply made and doesnt work Couldnt get the flame to turn from yellow to blue as its supposed to And once I turned it off it kept burning for better than five minutes Taking it back to Coleman 
I bought this to take to Haiti for use in with my missions work I drain gas from my motorcycle tank using the included filterfunnel This stove works wonderfully I am now ordering a second to keep at my house here in the US for use during electric outages 
Awesome burner worth the money I would recommend to friends 
Excellent product I really like it Recommend it highly 
Worked as expected 
The tent kit is decent but the hammer is very cheaply made and fell apart quickly 
Handy kit with very useful camping gear 
Campers best friend 
The tent stakes that came with my tent are the cheap metal ones I love how this kit includes the heavy duty stakes that wont pull up in a wind storm This kit has everything you need to setup and take down your tent 
This is what the tent mfgs should include with there larger tents a pair of small cheap channel lock plyer will complete the set because in a lot of soils these pegs hold so well they are hard to pull straight out but with a quick twist with the plyers and out they come Recommend 
Good quality Solid  sturdy Perfect for camping 
I love the set work great for me 
Arrived chipped and bent Enamel missing off cups and some bowls Had to return due to them being unusable 
This stove is on the shelf at Chinamart for 98 I paid 65 on Amazon with free shipping Since this is a metal stove I was concerned how it would arrive but it was in THREE boxes The factory box and two Amazon boxes I have read reviews where people complain it is difficult to light this stove These are the same people who buy a new tent never take it out of the box until they are at a campsite then whine because it was difficult to set up after dark in a windstorm Great Coleman quality and GREAT shipping from Amazon 
Been using these stoves for way over 40 years Just purchased a new dualfuel stove Bought it because obviously unleaded is cheaper than Coleman fuel by a lot Set it up fueled it up lit it worked fine Just got it so have no idea about durability yet Some people are saying they are cheaply made of course they are this is 2013 what item like this at this price isnt cheaply made Treat it with TLC read the instructions before using it and it will be fine Its suppose to be made with lightweight sheet metal it is lighter to carry and cools off faster If you want a professional stove in the boonies good luck I think they are great 
Real flimsy as most have stated but we bought it for emergencies or outdoor activities Was very hard to light the 1st time we used it 
Was made in the 60s that still roars and works You can not really kill a Coleman stove unless you are beyond stupid Yes coleman has changed up some but they still make a product that works and in general beats the pants off all others It is what it is and has always been what it is 
This single burner is awesome ive my used it twice now camping does great toast heats up water quickly it does have notches for different size pans and it does well the only thing it was bigger than i expected I am able to attach it to my to my pack with two clips but make sure you bring something to take off the coffee pot it does get the handle hot Other than that it great 
It is what it is and its okay for what its supposed to do But Im considering sending it back for a refund then reordering it since its now 10 less 8 
Now this is a cool designed stove Simple and sturdy Packs up small and cooks like any Coleman stove Plenty large base to use and pan or pot you want 
Works as you might expect I like that I can put my 14 round cast iron griddle on it  no frame to get in the way But the construction seems generally flimsy and theres no excuse for not having some kind of fixture for stowing the fuel pipe 
Yet to use but as expected 
nice 
Great tent pegs compared to the super flimsy ones that usually come with tents The mallet really comes in handy when the terrain is hard as does the tool for pulling up the pegs One warning I did actually tear the plastic peg head trying to pull it out once so brute force isnt always the best way 
Love it Extremely helpful 
I bought this tent kit mostly because of the Coleman name I needed a solid mallet and stake remover and this was a great deal for the price The mallet itself is sturdy and works like a charm I prefer a mallet over a hammer because I hate the metalonmetal of certain tent spikes it tends to ruin both items Tent spikes are a dime a dozen and if you hit one wrong or camp on hard dirt youll break your spikes no matter who you invest in These hold up well for the price The only two downfalls to this set is the bag itself and the broom While you do have covers for the tent spikes those are easy to lose and once lost the spikes quickly begin poking through the bag itself so I store them elsewhere The broom and dustpan are just cheap If you really need a broom invest in a better one or use a small handheld batterypowered vacuum The bag works for storage for everything else that comes with the tent kit with no issues 
Works great 
It is a handy little kit to have if you tent camp We used everything in the kit on our last trip and everything worked as intended If you use the bigger 10 inch tent spikes the puller that comes with this kit is really handy I leave the spikes in the bag as spares after losing a couple on a buried tree stump The spikes got stuck about halfway and when I pulled them they were stuck so bad they bent So you never know what you will encounter out there buried beneath the ground and having spares is nice 
perfect for camping 
Very nice set 
Really nice set Came with a few scratches here and there but its camping gear so Im not worried about it I do hate that utensil carrier Its really hard to get the utensils back into the stretchy loop 
Good quality and happy with pricing too 
Good to set cheep paper plates on Works as it should 
These are ok The where a pain to get the bowls apart For some reason they where stuck together but not bad for your typical chinese stuff 
Works well but safety hazzard It would be five stars if the knob had a click or some effort to turn on and off The gas can be accidently turned on because it takes little effort to turn the knob 
Very useful as an add on burner with our camper We use it for boiling water outside for corn on the cob The base is wide and stable It can support large pots securely Fuel usage is surprisingly low 
I got this for another use for the propane I need for the Coleman Drip Coffee Maker And it is a winner Ive used it a few times and found it to be a virtual kiln for browning food and high temp cooking This thing really puts out a lot of heat and with a simmer mat can work to build a great pasta sauce from scratch Ive used it with small fry pans and a huge 6 gallon pot used for the pasta sauce for bringing and keeping water boiling While not a back pack stove it serves for car camping or in the back yard when you need a smaller cooking service Good buy but do watch what you have it sitting on I had to put some boards under the feet to keep it from melting a plastic surface 
I like the item but had some initial problems with it functioning correctly I would and have recommended this item to other but I also inform them of all of the pros and cons I believe and informed decision help for a better response and increases the thought process to make a purchase 
Bought this little gem to use in case of emergencies Have been preparing for the big one here in California so have bought freeze dried food to store a 55 gallon water barrel with pump from Amazon  also some small water packetsthe barrel idea is the best IMHO If you use freeze dried food you need a lot of water so that is why I went with the 55 gallon barrel 
Ive used one of these before that belonged to a friend So wanted one of my own After reading so many reviews of it being built with thinner material than in years past and arriving dented I still took a chance It came this afternoon I was prepared for the worst This item from Amazon was triple boxed When finally getting it out it was absolutely perfect The gauge of metal used throughout is just fine I wouldnt want it any thicker Very pleased with the quality of this product Im a backpacker car camper and boat camper This thing will last for decades I ordered another one to have on the mainland too No regrets here 
Have not used it yet Bought it for emergencies since it uses regular gas and not butane Had one 40 years ago when family went camping and it always worked 
Had mine for 15 years and she is still going strong I use it for camping and the also in winter for the alltoofrequent powerout we get I really cant think of anything I dont like about it  its just exactly what I need in a camping stove I use it exclusively with gasoline so I get a small amount of pot blackening  and Ill have to clean the burners sometime soon but hey  once every 15 years isnt bad A little bit of surface rust on the underside  probably from using it in the snow  but if it rusts out in a few years Im going to replace it with exactly the same unit 
Too big and clunky  I bought it to use on my boat  it takes up alot of room and works okay  would never buy another one  
Small light easy to pack and carry Puts out plenty of heat For a oneoff stove this is the real deal 
I dont really use this I got it as a power failure backup I did test it and it works very well It gets very hot if you need to boil water and low enough to cook some eggs All and all good The missing star is for the bottle arm It just seems like it could be less ackward 
I used this when I went car camping last summer It is low to the ground and very stable which makes it perfect for skillets and a cast iron dutch oven I use my Coleman smaller and taller propane stove to heat water for my coffee I never woory about this one falling over Outstanding value at Amazons price 
Perfect camp set 
whats not to love Solid quality really pretty easy to clean Nice to have everything you need for eating in one pack 
Great set of camp dishes Quality seems good and the knives are very sharp for what they are 
I use this set every time I go camping and have never been disappointing with it The sweeper makes having a clean tent easy and the rubber malletanchors are better than what came stock with my tent Its a simple set of tools but it works every time as expected 
As expected 

perfect 
This was purchased for the sole reason it runs off gasoline as well as Coleman fuel Gasoline isnt cheap but have you priced a can of Coleman fuel lately I have only tested this to make sure it works on gasoline and then boxed it back up for that time we hope never comes But if it does I feel gasoline will be a little easier to locate especially if you cant get out to go to Wally World Academy Sports etc Pick up an inexpensive handpowered transfer pump rated for gasoline always keep at least a half tank of gas in your cartruck and youll be having hot food and coffee when others are doing without The only freaky thing about this stove is how the fuel tube from the tank to the burners runs directly above one of the burners No worries it was designed to be this way to help prep the fuel for burning So get it cheaper here at Amazon save more on shipping and maybe even on sales tax too Please Congress dont ruin a good thing 
I love this product for the beach or the mountains is a good accessory for adventures recommend and will make you not need anything then you try this product 
If you are a car camper this is the stove for you Gas is much easier to come by reliably than propane is The people who are complaining about the gauge of the metal are forgetting that this IS strong enough to do what you need it to do  cook a meal  and lighter than the older stoves that had SLIGHTLY thicker metal I see no issues with build quality or design and it works perfectly every time Any metal object that has paint on it is susceptible to scratching I simply waxed the box it came in and keep it in that The wax keeps the box from getting damp and adds a bit of stiffness I keep it clean and dont throw it around and guess what  good to go Buy it think love it 
The Green Dragon was a bit scary for the first few minutes Once it warmed up it purred like a pussycat and cooked my bacon and eggs while perking a pot of coffee It did not use much fuel stores compactly and was easy to adjust Great product 
Its what you remember as a kid sturdy and reliable the lip has a bit of a roughness but at least I know I can through it on the burner and know it wont warp melt or tarnish from heat 
I dont camp often but this thing will definitely be going with us on our next trip Since I dont see me doing real off trail camping I plan to use this with the 20 lb propane tanks Yes there is a special adapter for that The small bottles are just too expensive and I hear the refilling cable doesnt work that well and doesnt completely fill the small bottles all the way 
Really love this stove but 3 stars due to safety concerns We have had to use it several times when the power was out Just went to patio and fired it up Great for camping too We need our coffee no matter   Only reason we did not give this 5 stars is you have to be careful with the angle of the bottle resulting in how it was sitting when you tighten the connector up to the stove Otherwise a slight move of the bottle results in loosening the connector thus causing a gas leak and while its easily remedied you must pay attention to what you are doing This is where SAFETY comes in Pay attention to the connector and bottle position and watch you do not create a huge problem  otherwise when setup properly  EXCELLENT 
It just arrived and while other reviewers complain its too small I have to ask too small for what Youre not going to dig a drainage ditch with this shovel thats true but its the right size for a backpacking shovel which is its main purpose It folds up nicely and is very compact in the carrying case Slightly weighty due to the steel but I expect it will be rather durable as well It does claim it can be used as a saw but I dont think the teeth are sharp enough for that 
It gets the job done but there are definitely better shovels out there This one cannot lock with any angle in it and loosens itself during sustained use 
It is much smaller than I expected but it is of very good quality I have actually found the the belt size package is quite useful If you want a small camphiking shovel this is a great package If you are looking for something to do a larger job look elsewhere 
Works great and has proven its reliability over time That it uses both regular gas and white gas is a plus Armageddon is coming and this stove would be good to have when all hell breaks loose and the grocery stores are empty 
Some reviewers have nostalgia for the older Coleman and I have one of those But this is improved and burns better We camp out 2 months of the year and give it steady use It just simply works hot or cold windy or calm 

Nice way to help set up clean and take down your tent Good purchase 
This is awesome the stakes are better than what came with my tent and its super convenient I totally recommend this kit to everyone 
great tent kit 
Handy 

We were impressed by how large and solid this is  definitely a cut above many of the beach shelters we saw for sale Folds up small and light with a nice carrying case Will get a lot of use 
One plate was chipped 
Ordered 2 sets for camping Check each piece carefully as some items arrived chipped and dented Well worth the price even though I had to discard 2 pieces which were too badly damaged 
Good 
coffee cup had rusty top did not get painted  I guess they miss top but do enjoy them John Bradford 
Absolutely the best camping stove in the business Why would anyone want to use higher priced propane that doesnt put out as much heat Or work in the cold By the way make sure to preheat the unit if it is really cold Then no worries 
I used the stove on a three day camping trip at a very remote quiet and beautiful place Testing it before I went probably would have been wise but I didnt I took it out of the box filled it with fuel and lit it right up It worked perfectly I did have to turn up the first burner in order to lite the auxiliary burner but everything worked exactly as it should have 
UPDATE I have had this stove for 3 years now and have used it quite a lot and have never had a problem with it We are also just bought our second camper which has a suburban propane stove hooked to a 25 pound propane bottle and we still take this little guy along with us set it up on the picnic table and cook outdoors I just couldnt be happier with this little guy Everything I said in my original review still holds true Original Review below is still valid I havent had this stove long but I just cooked dinner on it and did a review Go to Youtube and type in themarkfellows2 and look for my review It will be uploaded tonight and ready for viewing in the morning I cooked a large pot of Chicken Egg Drop soup and it performed great with plenty of power from the main burnerI didnt use the auxiliary burner but I am sure it is fine I boiled 8 cups of chicken broth 2 cups of water and cooked 2 pounds of chicken and vegetables in about 30 minutes Start to finish The stove lights and works very well The Auxiliary burner is easy to light and extinguish I used Coleman fuel that was AT LEAST 10 years old and maybe 20 years old and left first in a porch exposed to cold and heat and sunlight It burned just fine I have found Coleman fuel to be Extremely stable Propane is more stable and burns cleaner but I just can not justify using those little 1 pound bottles and then chucking them in the trash when they are empty It just seems really stupid to me to use those If they have an adapter to make one of those propane stoves use a 20 pound bottle more power to you I will stick with liquid fuel if I can It generates much less waste than the 1 pound bottles and you can get fuel anywhere Plus this can run on gasoline if you wish Anyway back to the stove It is great It lights easily has plenty of power has great fine adjustment on the heat and burns very steadily after the first five minutes and the generator heats up This will be a fine stove for my car camping I already have an MSR Dragonfly for backpacking One big plus was that it was manufactured in the USA That means a lot to me over Chinese goods Be aware though the first couple times you use it you will likely burn some paint off so you will smell burning paint fumes a little if you have the burner turned up high Also the stove body gets hot so keep stuff that will melt away from it I put a video on youtube where I cook a pot of soup with 20 year old coleman fuel Go to youtube and look for the suburban hippie survivalist and look for my video on it Good luck Mark  
ordered this to use as household backup have used 3 times all for soups and a chile dish worked great and still on first tank of fuel i suspect theres enough fuel for one more use its been great i would recommend it 
Just used it several times in National Parks and other places on my recent trip to the west I did have a little trouble getting the connection to work at times 
Truthfully I am one of those people who is kinda afraid of gasflames and always had trouble lighting my older camping stoves for fear of burning my fingers trying to light it Not so with this product The open grill makes it incredibly easy to light and the whole process of getting it set up and on is incredibly smooth and easy Additionally I am very happy with how sturdy and portable it is I would definitely recommend this to friends 
Burns hot quickly made coffe and eggs easy to pack and store great one Burnner for the road Go Coleman 
This is a horrible little stinky stove that is very inefficient by todays standards Trust me Im a sucker for older designsthis aint one you want to hold onto The burners are fickle leave soot on the bottom of your gear and are grossy inefficent at heating stuff  the main reason you presumably are in the market for a stove Get a propane unit first of all second of all get one with the knobs on either end and not side by side  those stick wont adjust and are horrible as well I went through the entire Coleman catalog so I could help you Learn from my mistakes This stove would probably be ok if the apocalypse comes and you want to run the stove for awhile from your burnt out cars gas tank Otherwise you will look like a moron among your fellow car camping friends meantime 
This is a great camp stove When I was growing up we camped with the Coleman model that required the propane tanks Invariably we always ran out of fuel and it was always when mom was cooking dinner It was always brutal torture waiting to eat when youre a starving kid With that in mind I did not want a propane tank stove Plus the cost of tanks is pretty expensive and I can never tell how much is left in them I love being able to bring 2 or 3 tins of fuel yes I know overkill and know that well never run out The cost of the fuel tins is so much cheaper than propane tanks I also like the fact that I can tell how much fuel is in the front tank Its easy to light and has enough power to heat up cast iron pans pretty quickly I much prefer to cook on this camp stove than my electric range at home I would definitely recommend this stove 
looks like a very nice kit for my purposes 
Worked great 
product work as indicated 
Handy 
I had a single burner that mounted on the top of the propane bottle I was never comfortable with that design This is much better It sits flat on the counter and now when the power goes out I can perk a pot of coffee or fry a hamburger without worrying about the whole thing tipping over 
I have had this for two years now and have used it about 10 times I would guess I also find it difficult but not impossible to set to low heat and it has been a lot more reliable than the two induction stoves I have tried It is large enough to be a stable platform for a 12 skillet and light enough to be packed anywhere which makes it a much better solution than our the bulky heavy smallish burnergrill side by side coleman stove it is replacing I just purchased a 2nd one so I can have two going at once 
When I opened the box I was surprised at the size but a test run showed me that a this stove can handle a big pot and b most important  the balance Because this stove is low and wide it is quite stable and a pot is not likely to tip or fall off In my book stability is important 
Great little shovel surprising quality 
Sold but small 
This is small not like a full size entrenching tool Does the job Keep it in the car tucks under the seat in case were stuck in snow 
Thank you 
With this tool you can get with it fast and furious 
I received the stove yesterday No problems with shipping or packaging I purchased a 1 gallon can of Coleman fuel at WalMart for about 7 The stove came with a filter funnel which made filling easy The stove instructions were a little hard to read but this is a simple product I pumped the stove about 40 pumps to pressurize the stove I lit the stove and there was very high yellow flames initially so keep your windscreen out of the way so you dont overheat the paint I opened up both burners and let it rock for 35 minutes Soon the wild yellow flame disappeared and I got a nice blue flame I turned the stove off and it burned out in 30 seconds It is a small cooking area If you are hosting a large camp site and plan to be using very large pots and pans you might want to look at the 3 burner This would be fine for a small base camp with small to medium size cookware This would easily serve well for a 24 person camp I liked that the instructions were posted on a sticker inside the lid They show it being lit with a match but i think it would be safer and easier to use a long lighter if you have one WalMart had the stove for 7800 with tax it would be about 8500 It was 8800 online 7800 in store One last but important note The instructions say you can use unleaded fuel if necessary It is the if necessary language that bothers me That is legal speak for you can use unleaded fuel but we prefer you to use Coleman fuel If that is the case you might be better off just buying the stove that operates on Coleman fuel I saw a post that talked about unleaded fuel containing ethanol corroding the seals but I cant verify this Overall a good piece of equipment Happy trails 
Great setup for camping Coleman high quality Nice utensil case Big plates nice size bowls and coffee cups Enamel coating extremely durable Should last for many years Wish it came with case 
I wanted to make fried Oreos but my wife said I would make too big of a mess in her kitchen So I took out my Coleman PowerPack and a cast iron pan and made them in the garage Great treats made on a great little stove Works flawlessly and easy cleanup too 
Perfect heat source Colemans Coffee maker The Coffee maker looks just like the original Mr Coffee but with no power cord Thus the need for the 1Burner Stove I have a trailer I take to civic events most of the time those places  DONT HAVE proper outdoor electrical connections usually I get told to use a 15 or 20 Amp outlet and a 100ft extension cord That means I have enough electricity to run the refrigerator fan and one electric skillet If we make Pancakes you have to make Coffee I have since purchased 2 Colemans propane skillets Now we can have Pancakes Eggs Coffee and run the Air Conditioner 
I used it on car camping area Its small and compact and work perfect I can regulate flame easily Only minus is that it doesnt have wind protection so in windy day you may need to invent some kind of wind cover for it 
Yes campers this is the one to buy The same kind of green metal stove that Grampa couldnt break Sure its not quite as sturdy as the old ones but its still pretty darn rugged And you can use the same stuff you dump in the car to fire it no nonrefillable tank to mess with It heats a pot of water to boiling almost as fast as my fancy kitchen range If you cant cook it on a Coleman 2 Burner Dual Fuel Compact Liquid Fuel Stovedont eat it 
I just bought a second one of these for my folks to have for car camping and earthquake preparedness I have had the other one for over ten years and it just keeps on fine These are very durable little stoves They are easy to use  except that you need a match or lighter and are very stable Certainly much more so than the 1 burner camping stoves you see for backpacking etc As far as the requiring a match its actually just simpler that way You can always find matches at a store but you wont often find the replacement parts for an ignitor unit when it finally needs to be replaced  A lot of people like the propane stoves but then they waste a lot of those expensive canisters A ten dollar gallon can of fuel for this thing will last as longer than 15 of the propane tanks for most stoves And of course being able to run it on unleaded gasoline in an emergency is a very useful feature for earthquake emergency preparedness I have actually used my stove for weeks on end while camping If you are in an emergency situation this will allow you to boil water and still make good hot food when your gas line or electricity is out There is enough space that you can use pretty decent size pots and pans For instance when I make my spaghetti and italian sausage there is plenty of room to boil the water in a big pot while cooking up the italian sausage in a skillet right next to it If you are really worried about space have a big family etc than you should consider the three burner variant of this stove If you are a car camper or want a good little stove for emergency situations this is the one for you 

This is a great product We used it everyday several times a day for 5 days for a family of four Two men two women translated 2 big eaters 2 little eaters It is constructed well and we think it will last a long time It stores nicely Simple to use Easy to clean Flame even and hot Boils water fast important for coffe in AM Flame never blew out Can use one or both burners Fuel tank keeps pressure for long timeeasily enough to cook the meal if it does go low easy to pump pressure right up in a few quick strokes Spacious enough for a 12quart pot and a frying pan if you open wings Thoroughly recommend 
My 2 burner Coleman Dual Fuel stove is one that my father bought when I was a kid to take camping in our pop up I remember many meals prepared on it back then I stopped camping for about 25 years and just recently decided to start camping again with my family I knew the Coleman would have to come with us So I got my Dads old Coleman stove and put a little Coleman fuel in it pumped it up and it still runs like a champ This is one piece of camping equipment that is nearly indestructible if you take any care of it at all As stated by others not backpacking equipment but perfect for rving and car camping This is one of the few products made by any company that lives up to its reputation and actually exceeds it by a fair margin You really cant go wrong with this little stove Easy to use easy to transport and it will outlast you most likely Its something that can be handed down to your kids or even grandkids someday 
Great stove for car camping or just to have around the house Purchased because it will burn unleaded gasoline or standard camp fuel basically gasoline as well not to mention not having to deal with those obnoxious propane bottles Could be constructed a little more bulletproof but it still seems like it will last quite a while Lights quickly and burns cleanly on camp fuel havent needed to use gasoline yet Would definitely buy again 
Very good quality for a small tool Heavy duty steel and collets Coleman quality which should hold up even against Cub Scouts 
Decent construction great price I enhanced its function by using a belt sander to sharpen the edges of the shovel and the pick Should be much more functional when needed 
Great for small digging or charcoal handling 
i use this when i go out camping 
Perfect small size to take anywhere Very well constructed 
Convenient tool kit for solving all your tent installation needs and includes a dust pan to remove unwanted dirt tracked inside your tent 
work great 
The stakes seem to be pretty well built And the hammer does not seem to have any quality issues as i read in another post The sweeper and the stake remover are what youd expect cheap and flimsy But they will do the job I have for them The bag fits everything in it just fine I would strongly recommend keeping the stake caps so they dont poke out of the bag and the bag for the sweeper and also as the manual for my tent says DO NOT STORE INSIDE TENT You will get holes from this stuff 
its ok the same item 
Im not entirely sure why I bought this It seemed like a good idea at the time I was buying two tents However once it arrived I thought I may have been losing it Who wants to carry a single purpose mallet around simply to hammer in tent spikes There are cheaper and less heavy ways to accomplish the same thing Nevertheless Im too lazy to send things back so I kept the kick I expect that it will just remain in my basement as I carry my camp axe in place of the mallet 
A little kiddie like but not horrible 
I used the product on a 2 week camping trip It was very handy to keep things like bread and chips organized 
This is the neatest little dome my son is a red headed fair skinned little man and i love the beach so this is perfect he can hang out in here and play while not getting too much sun Im so glad I bought this 
purchased these for my father in law for chritmas he loves them However has not had the oppurtinity to try them out camping yet so cant say how durable they are 
Good product 
This is a great product when you need a burner and are traveling via plane I love the portability of it 
I wanted propane because I already have a lot of other propane style cookware for camping aside from a few older Coleman camp stoves that require liquid fuel Its good for the morning to make coffee if your grillstove is already being used to cook breakfast I was originally debating a smaller MSR or Jetboil style single burner for the smaller size but I decided to go with this one It is probably to big to pack for hikes considering you have the larger burner and the 1 lb propane bottle 
Ive owned many camp stoves over the past half century cheap and expensive ones Been using this one regularly for seven years or so and its possibly the best singleburner stove Ive used for car camping  Unlike most singleburners its large footprint rubber feet and low profile make it very stable especially with larger pots  pans This makes it safer than others important if youve got kids around Nothing more disappointing than having a nice pot of chili cooking and have it tip over into little Johnnys lap  Easy to set up and get cooking right away No liquid fuel to spill no odor no pumping or waiting for a generator to heat up Ive used it in windy conditions and its rarely blown out  Easy to clean Many stoves have a lot of exposed parts on top that catch spilled food This one doesnt The large painted surface around the burner stays relatively cool so I havent had to scrub any burned food It just wipes off  Very sturdy Ive used heavy cast iron pots without fear of crushing it The pot supports go down to the feet rather than into the stove itself  A few tips  This stove can simmer fairly well at the lowest setting and has a large diameter burner that spreads the heat heat out better than smaller ones However a simple diffuser plate many available here on Amazon on top of the burner helps this and most other type stove keep from scorching food in the center of the pan Very useful if using thin aluminum camping pots  A little powdered graphite applied to the threads of the propane fitting makes it easier to thread the bottle into it  Protect the fittings of the propane tube assembly form dirtdamage I keep the assembly in a ziplock bag Be careful not to crossthread the bottle when screwing it into the fitting  Propane isnt as cheap as liquid Coleman fuel for the same heat output but at 2 for a 1 propane bottle that will generally last for many hours cooking not bad No need for the expensive little proprietary cans that other stoves use Can also be hooked up to a larger tank if need be  This is a great item for anyone wanting to simplify their camp cooking Cant say enough good about it 
Love it works great Would buy again Great for emergencies Starts quick good heat well made Not too big and very transportable 
Purchased for camping gear Similar to one my father had when I was a kid This one not as large but will serve its purpose 
compact and fits in a pocket of my backpack i use it for camping 
great 
Great item to have on hand 
The mallet is a must have for camping trips The stakes are much better than the ones that came with our Coleman tent Highly recommend 
none 
Great little kit that makes setting up and taking down a tent a little bit easier The price of the rubber mallet and stakes alone are worth it I didnt think I would use the mini broom and dust pan but they are surprisingly useful and nice to have around to clean up the tent Everything seems good quality especially for the price Overall no complaints Not necessary to camp but definitely nice 
nice kit 
All the things I need 
Worth what I paid for this kit 
Nice sturdy camping set Easy to clean Love that the silverware roll up in the case 
compact and worked 
nice set for my bus very happy 
Too thin to be any sturdy Im surprised Coleman put their name on this Buy anything but this one The threads locking the shovelpick in position arent very deep therefore not strong It kept coming loose every time I tried digging with it 
Awesome tool Smaller than anticipated but great for a backpacker conserving space 
Personally I thought this shovel would be larger That being said Im glad its small it is far more handy for my proposesmoving briquettes for dutch oven and digging a pit to start briquettes 
Very good quality 

We bought this a beach shovel for the adults to make large holes for the kids to play in The shovel did not last more then one use Probably our own fault since it got sand and water on it Rusted immediately and would not open 
I got this for my camp box and to keep around in case I needed a saw the edges of could be a little more smoother works good in a pinch and is better than nothing it is small and compact and that is good 
This saw is only for light and infrequent use The nut loosens and needs locktite Other reviewers are correct that the blade opens on its own and the locking tab bent on mine also The saw gets jammed very easily causing the blade to bend I had to straighten it several times after using it during a 4 day hike While cutting some overgrown vines the plastic handle cracked at the forward tip and it fell apart I have the incredible Dollar General folding saw and it works much better  got it on clearance for 1 It stays closed locks open better and the blade is much more durable than the Coleman The blade is a bit thicker and you can realy power through a good sized chunk of wood without the blade bending  sorry Coleman but I have to keep it real here 
The saw worked moderately well but was a little whimpy If the wood was very dry it cut right through If the wood was wet or green it was very difficult not to bend the blade while working It is compact and light and will be utilized for years to come 
Ok generally the Coleman name makes me think of affordable yet tough and rugged equipment or at least it did till I got this FLIMSY PIECE OF JUNK Im sure itll saw just fine but my problem is the darned thing DOES NOT STAY SHUT If I have a folding knife or saw in this case I want to know it will stay shut when its shut and open when open Well it appears to lock open ok but it wont lock closed The blade just falls open right away after you fold it up I tightened the screw to make it tougher to open and that helped a bit but it still looks like it could jostle open an inch An inch of open blade is still too much open blade when I WANT IT CLOSED The last thing I want to do when Im out in the wilderness is reach in my pack for my saw and encounter the teeth BEWARE The saw does not even fold up decently The only reason Im giving it 2 stars is because it looks like it would cut ok Buy at your own risk I thought Id enjoy having a nice lightweight yet durable fold up saw but I might just go for a normal camping saw with a blade guard Im really disappointed I wasted the money on something that looked to be a really good buy Sadly its not even worth the hassle of returning 
We have a large rectangular tent with a loop in each roof corner We have been using this one next to the entrance for 3 years now about 60 days total It has been incredibly handy for storing stuff up off the floor at eye level without taking up any real space you cannot really walk into the corners of a tent and it hangs above sleeping level I have a 20 off code and decided to get three more for the remaining corners It did get bent out of shape once but I just kept it pressed between 2 boards during storage and it is as good as new again We have not had a tear yet and we have put over 5 lbs of stuff in it Since the mesh extends about 34 of the way around there is not much worry about stuff falling out Since it fold flat it travels very well 
If you set up a tent or shelter for your day at the beach BUY THIS If you want a safe nonsandy dry willnotgetsteppedon place for your book sunglasses iPod dog treats etc this is the thing for you It is big weighs almost nothing and holds a lot of stuff off the sand Depending on what you put in it it may be too heavy for a beach umbrella and pull It over or bonk you in the head its surprisingly big but for one of those big family sun shelters or a square canvas awning its just the ticket and much easier to deal with than just hanging up a bag Its also handy for stowing empty botlles  other trash so they dont blow away or take up floor space Genius OhI almost forgotfor all you Yosemite Curry Village tent cabin fans this is so nice for keeping all the little things off the floor organized and easy to get to 
Its larger than I imagined which is fine holds lots of stuff does a fine job 
This works great for drying out containers and other things that I have washed Instead of drying them I stick all of them in the organizer upside down It dries them quick I am thinking of ordering another one for storing my bread hotdog buns and other foods so the squirrels wont get them I hang this on my canopy since we dont have room for it our small popup camper It is worth the money 
In love with this little stove I only go camping once every couple months for a weekend or two and needed something relatively cheap to heat up food This stove exceeded my expectations Very sturdy and served its purpose It is the size of a larger burner that youd see on a stove at home so its not great spacewise for those who like to go backpacking 
I love my coleman 1 burner stove It is reliable and efficient and easy to assemble I have never had any problems with it The one downside for me and this is just personal taste is that it is a little large for my own needs 
This is a LARGE CAPABLE STOVEthe Propane canister is shown actual size so the burner is not pocket size It will run about 2 hours with a 141 canister  think torch and the recommended 164 oz canister will give about TWO and a HALF hours of cooking or heating ability  YES I use it indoorsI feel safe that even if I fall asleep TWO and a HALF hours will not kill me in the cabin I dont suggest you do thatBUT I DO This is a stable burner that is easy to cook on SURE you have a stovebut this is good for everyday use and BETTER for the day that the power goes out or you decide to cook on the patio 
This was a little larger than I expected but it is still more compact than the single stove that sits on top of a propane or any of my duel stoves It is extremely stable compared to the one that sits on top of a propane tank and I can put one of the 8 quart pots on it with easy I love using it with my 12 inch wok and it is compact since it is flat and no extra stand piece to carry I wish I bought this sooner and not my other single propane burner 
A family member has become interested in camping and this accompanied a Farberware stainlesssteel percolator coffee pot A great way to augment cooking when its not practical to stoke up a woodfire especially when it comes to getting the morning coffee going Broad stable base 
As expected 
Perfect 
1st star for fast delivery 2nd star for durability 3rd star for price considering product 4th star for customer service 5th star for ease of use 
Love it once up but way hard to put together and Im the one people come to for help putting things together 
It is great but you need two person to install it 
Best looking beach tent on the beach Easy to setup Stands strong against the wind Love it 
Im sure it works pretty well bc its a trusted company but as a single mom having to carry everything I returned it because its pretty heavy 
I bought this for my stepdad as a gift So I havent actually used it It does appear however to be of the same quality as the two burner Coleman I do own This 1burner model is well made Its definitely designed in a way that could accept either a small coffee pot or other camping pot all the way up to a nice sized cast iron skillet or a huge regular sized pot of water usually used for boiling spaghetti or the like I went with this product because of its stability I love the low profile and wide base It will really give a nice pot of chili the stability you need when cooking and stirring The other models that screw directly onto the burner seemed like theyd be top heavy or would need a really level surface to be able to relax a little while cooking Its got a good weight to it  durable enough to know itll support what youre cooking but not so heavy that its going to be a pain in the ass to take places This is the perfect burner for the weekend camper the car camper the occasional camperbasically any camper thats not going on a 5 day backpacking excursion Its also a good just in case burner in case you lose electricity or need something in an emergency situation I also like that it attaches to the smaller gas tanks that are cheap and convenient to pack and carry It may not be absolutely wind resistant but its low profile gives someone with a little ingenuity plenty of options to fashion up some sort of wind barrier if it comes to that I havent actually used this yet but like I said it looks and feels a lot like my two burner Coleman and that one has worked flawlessly for years without any issues whatsoever It even has the same gas attachment as my other Coleman so it looks like they just took things and reconfigured for a single burner model I really cant foresee this model acting up but I will update as I have a chance to For the price I couldnt pass this up Great value I only gave it 4 stars because I havent actually used it yet So that rating is based on my initial observations and my past experience with Coleman burners While I dont own any 141 oz tanks I imagine those would work just fine The 169 oz are the commonly featured tank and I know those fit perfectly with this stove I believe the bushingsthreads are the same on the 141 oz tanks I also know they sell 141169 ozto20 lb tank adapters so that you can hook this puppy up to a 20 lb tank So because the adapter is named with both weights on it Id assume both would fit this stove Those are just my observations on the 141 oz tank though 
This saw is ok Very cheaply made and will likely not hold up for very long 
good to have in back pack 
Its got a nice long blade that makes cutting small branches easy and will fit in any backpack better than any other saw Ive used 
Light weight easy to carry 
This has been sitting in my Jeep tool kit for trail chores but has rarely been used I was messing around building a bow drill and I was using only a knife and this saw Im cutting a pretty hard wood black locust we had on our property and the saw is not up to the task I can eventually get through the 2inch limbs but only with a lot of sticking and skipping Mind you black locust is 25 times as hard as pine and nearly as hard as hickory but Im a bit disappointed For five or ten more bucks I could get a saw that cuts better and is better built This will remain in my tool kit but Ill grab a better saw for camp chores 
I have had very good luck with mine Ive used it mainly for trimming Cedar limbs around bow stands and ground blinds It has worked very well in tight elevated spaces where a hatchet or machete is unwieldy It survived a 15 foot drop from a tripod stand and kept going Well worth th 10 bucks I spent 
Shifty locking gadget on this sawwill have to modify it somehow so that its sturdier and reliable As stated before the saw does not lock closed Apply a rubber band and youre solid Cuts well and is light 
GREAT 
Nice 
Very nice set of dishes for camping very compact and easy to transport 
absolutely perfect nostalgic feel fairly durable I have been using my set for 3 years and countless escapades 
havent used yet but it is good for now 
Lots of folks seem to have problems with these saws Cant speak to the issue of the hardware loostening but if you use it like a pull saw that is cutting only on the back stroke it works better and does not buckle It is a low cost saw so dont expect a high performance tool But it will work if you are patient 
Got these for our camping and hunting Though they are a bit bigger than we thought they will be fine for what we want 
bought this to take on my ATV so far so good its real sharp cuts quick and was cheap enough that I wont feel too bad if it gets lost 
I have been purchasing Coleman products for forty years or better this is the first piece of  that I have ever purchased of theirs heck I bought two and they are both loose wobbly cheep made  Shame on you Coleman 
This is one of the tools Ive collected in case we have to bug out in an emergence It cuts real fast without a lot of strain and is easy to store without having to worry about snagging or ripping something else 
cuts all the small brush and branches up to the size of your wrist very well will cut larger diameters but it takes a little bit of patience its a nice lite weight saw and its easily packed 
Mallet head broke off during first use youre better off buying all of these separately and of higher quality 
This is worth the moneythe hammer has some weight to it but its nice and compact 
OK quality Arrived within a reasonable amount of time 
was very good investment 
very good 
I wanted another burner to add to the the tree coming off my large propane tank This one will work in conjunction with my coleman two burner setup It definitely is large but that will be good for holding puts I plan on using this for keeping something warm while still cooking for a quick heat up of water without having to setup the two burner It would have been nice to have an electric start like my other gadgets but I carry a refillable lighter anyway just in case the electric doesnt start The knob is also ok for control You have low and a very small amount of turning needed to get it to high Then you can keep turning the knob and it doesnt get any hotter A lot of knob motion for a short range 
This stove is large and served me well after I purchased it I was able to fit a 12 Lodge cast iron skillet on it without issue You might be able to fit an even larger pot on it If I could change anything 1 Make the burner diameter slight larger I had a real hotspot in the center of my pot even using cast iron 2 The regulator is machined aluminum and I fear crossthreading it every time I screw it onto a propane bottle 3 The heat shield on the underside of the stove is pretty sharp Careful while handling it 4 No easy ability to simmer with this stove It pretty much runs at a medium or high setting 
Very pleased with this burner Big and sturdy The box says a 1lb can should last 25 hours I dont know what anyone would be cooking that long but good to know To big and bulky to go hiking with Takes up to much room in the back pack Great for camping I got it for an emergency Will get a second one 
I bought this to make coffee I was looking for something small lowprofile so it wouldnt tip over like those other stoves and efficient Its actually bigger than the picture reflects which is a good thing pumps out a lot of flame or just a simmer and is the easiest stove to clean out there In fact it is SO good we are getting rid of our foldup Coleman twoburner stove which is a pain in the butt to clean and buying another one of these for camping The fold up twoburner stove is such a pain you cant use two good size pans at the same time and if youre frying something grease gets everywhere With two of these stoves sidebyside youve got a true gourmet stove for the outdoors Easier to store clean and use than any other arrangement you can come up with Not for backpacking obviously but if youve got an RV love to car camp or need a good outdoor burner for your barbques  This is the one to get This is not a dinky stove it will hold your cherished castiron trout fryer And take up less room than your foldup greasetrap two burner bear attractor 
coffee cups are a little hot on the lips when filled with hot coffee everything else is good 
Had some chips in whatever they coated the plates in Did t return because it was only one of the plates but quality control needs to fire some folks 
I got these as a gift and have camped once with the set It is very durable and survived with no problem To use this camping you have to ask the question of the convenience of throwing paper plates into the camp fire vs washing dishes Washing dishes uses a lot of water and fuel to heat the water but you will only use these car camping and up Overall I love the set Just buy some cheap steak knives to complement the silverware and you are ready for glamping 
Bought this for our toddler to use on the beach to take naps in It was perfect We used it everyday Often times in heavy ends and it stood the test of time We used it for naps for baby and also to keep our stuff out of the sand It small and stores easily Packed it in suitcase Definitely worth the price Great product 
Kind of a pain to set up Zipper ripped on 1st use  Returned for the instant one that cost more Couldnt be happier with the other one 
This is fantastic It is bigger than anticipated It is light weight and seems to be made well 
Very compact and portable but still too heavy to recommend to take backpacking Would work great for camping where weight isnt an issue but if weight is not an issue you might as go with something a little bit bigger 
Great very compact for a backpack 
Handy little tool 
Very small but OK 
Expect this to be the size of a garden shovel and you wont be disappointed Somewhat light duty but did find in sand where it will predominantly be used It will not tolerate rocky hard soil for long Folds and handle unscrews for to a very small portable package In a pinch to dig a small hole it will work fine 
As usual Coleman makes the best camping products Having said that I didnt order it for camping I love the Brazilian Churrascaria restaurants with thier fresh grilled variety of meats so my wife bought a miniature Churrascaria meat grilling setup through the Home Shopping Network for home use But the unit she bought is designed to fit down over an indoor GAS stove burner when you remove the pot  pan stand Our range is electric Most of the other portable oneburner gas stoves have permanently mounted pot  pan stands or when you remove the ones that dont the burner doesnt protrude from the stove like a normal inhome gas range burner would In the case of this coleman singleburner stove the burner protrudes like on a home stove and the grate easily pops out One last benefit that I hadnt counted on is the fact that the base plate is EXACTLY the same width as the Churrascaria grill setup In fact when placed on top of the burner it looks like the two units are made for each other Thats how good the fit is So if you like the idea of grilling meats on a skewer indoors but dont have a gas stove the Churrascaria grill sold on HSN fits like a glove on this particular portable singleburner gas stove 
I have used this stove for both car camping and cooking at bike races and like a few things about it One is that it is much more stable than the typical single burner stoves so putting a large pot or pan on the grates is not a problem In addition the propane gas cylinders are quite cheap in comparison to the jetboils or other small tank stoves so it is cheaper to operate On the other hand there are a few easy fixes that would make this a better product One is that the unit requires a small extension tube to connect to the fuel tank and this needs to be unscrewed and carried separately The bottom of the stove has lots of room but that is taken up by a rather useless piece of aluminum that could easily have been modified to allow the tank connector to snap into place so it is not lost in moving the unit around Organization is particular important for camping as you have lots of stuff and if one of the parts is missing it means the unit is worthless In addition the aluminum piece on the bottom is razor sharp so while cleaning it this evening I brushed my thumb on the edge of the guard and had a nasty cut These kinds of things are so obvious that I just dont understand how a company with as much experience as Coleman could miss them 
It is what you expect Broom is meh bag is meh Stakes work for 2 years of steady camping hammer works and puller does fine too I like the tidy package so I give it a 4 star rating Its what I expect at the price 
Not really worth it I purchases it with tent Disappointed with quality cheap version of components I live in Florida Stakes wont work well in soft sand will work in the keys coral very hard On my last trip to the keys just went to hardware store and got biggest nails I could find worked great These stakes are just big nails with plastic heads Again useless in sand or soft ground Mainly thought the bag would make set worthwhile not useless If I can find a better broom  dustpan combo and better rubber mallet for round same price this stuff is going back Steak puller is a joke bag would throw away anyway lm mad for buying this foe the quality should have been thrown in for free with tent 
Useless unless youre camping on sand Gage of hook to retrieve pins is not strong enough Bends like butter Mallet is the only worthwhile item here 
bought 2 worked great however bring a 20 oz claw hammer if there are any rocks around 
Cheap done but good 
Its really big but good product 
Kind of a pain to setup but way sturdier than the popup ones we see flapping around on the beach 
After several seasons with a Sport Brella Ive concluded umbrellas dont work at the beach because its only a matter of time before the right gust uproots the Umbrella Ive tried a number of anchoring methods all with the same result I see only Pros and no Cons with the Coleman Road Trip Beach shade There are some practical Considerations Pros especially vs Any Umbrella 1 Unidirectional full shade for 2 in Beach Chairs 2 Front Porch flap lets you leave sand and damp towels outside your sitting area 3 Rear door enables ample circulation and eliminates gustcapsizing 4 Full zipup offers full privacy or some security when you go in the water or head for snacks 5 360 degree protection from a rain or windstorm 6 It CANT blow away since you and your gear are weighing it down 7 Oh and it has a FLOOR you have the option of sitting or setting things anywhere 8 Pockets at all 4 corners for sunglasses snacks keys whatever 9 Less than half the pack size  weight yet more than twice the functionality of any Umbrella 10 No center pole Wide open spaces Considerations 1 Takes longer to set up and pack up but the benefits are definitely worth it 2 If youre at a crowded beach youll block the ocean view of those behind you Oh well Thats about it It would be very unwise to choose an umbrella over this product and this shelter leads its category for value 
Arrived in perfect order 
Purchases this as a christmas gift for my aunt I was supposed to wrap it but I think its going in my kitchen cabinets and I will order another for her Didnt think it would look that gorgeous for this price Thank you Thank you Thank you 
Excellent 
made cheaply and poorly Youd be better off getting a WWII shovel from the armynavy store 
This is very easy to set up The first time we set it up was in our playroom just to see how big it was  to get the feel for it because we were taking it to the beach Im very glad we did that because it was WINDY  so windy at the beach  I had to stand on one end while my husband had his knee on the other end He filled the sandbags  then we finally got it up  maybe a total of 20 minutes the first time The second time was a lot easier  keep in mind this was only because the wind was blowing so hard It held up nicely I got 2 kids down for a nap  it blocked the wind  the sun Im so glad we decided to get this one 
great for the beach but unfortunately after 3 uses the grommets that hold the metal sticks broke apart the metal grommets are not built property but i did like the portability and the shade it provides 
 in basement and 1st floor including all major appliances and still wo electric  Got this and coffee pot for them to be able to at least have coffee wo waiting for a coffee truck to come by Will upgrade after we hear how it worked for them  the reviews helped determine  specially larger pan for boiling water They expect to be in something temporary come late next week 
I already have both the 2burner rectangular stoves with lid  windscreen and also the burneronbottle product both from Coleman This single burner filled my need for something that packs much smaller than the 2burner is way safer than the burneronbottle and can share a 30x30in dining table I just used it today for a minipicnic cooking hamburgers at the table and it suddenly occured that duh its very sociable to cook right in front of your guests That would not have happened with the other stoves because of size and risks I skimmed the other reviews and yes the diameter is larger than expected verging on a disappointment since I was trying to pack smaller for small car camping I found the smooth continuous flame adjustment to be a much welcome improvement over the notchy adjustment of the burneronbottle product from coleman Im missing piezo electric start but a butane wand was a competent substitute 
I have some nephews starting into boy scouts and was interested in a stove they might like I liked the idea of one like this versus ones that sit on disposable tanks since it looks more stable as well as being able to connect it to a bulk tank if wanted with a hose Looking at the online pictures I liked the way this one looked with round bars for the pot support versus bent sheet metal supports in similar ones and thought That looks better if someone did try to carry such in a backpack since it wont have knifeblade like edges easily ripping into things So I ordered one up even with seeing some reviews of This is bigger than I expected thinking it may be 810 inches across versus 68 and not seeing anyone giving dims on it The truth is that the main body is 12 inch diameter at the base it is almost 14 inches across at the feet the widest points and the pot support bars will hold an 11 inch diameter pot with it sitting flat on the horizontal parts of the bars So maybe that tells you more about how Big it really is versus pictures of it alone that are hard to scale with no comparisons This also explains to me why it goes for over 30 versus many single burner stoves going for 1520 that I wondered about too before ordering it Ill keep it since having this may be as good or better than many 2 burner stoves where putting a 11 inch pan on them ends up with almost 12 the pan hanging off the edges but I hope this helps minimize surprises for others of you considering this 
Great kit for camping especially if you bought a Coleman tent My Coleman tent came with some flimsy stakes and as I didnt have a hammer to get them in the ground of course they got bent This tent kit was a great addition and works perfectly with my Coleman 4person tent The stakes are solid and will not bend especially if you use the included hammer There is also a tool to easily grab the stakes out of the ground so youre not digging in with your fingernails For those that are camping in the dry west the little dust brush actually does have some use Pros  Sturdy Stakes Essential Mallet Great tools all around Cons  I guess it could have come with more than 4 stakes but I dont anticipate them bending anytime soon 
Great little kit Has all the essentials in one neat little pack 
Ok 
This is My 2nd Folding Shovelits alot smaller then the other 1which the coleman works out great for the backpack  them smaller projects 
Great for camping pack or bug out bag Very compact and fits into smaller pockets of a pack 
Picked this up for metal detecting Some of the ground in the area is hard so I thought a shovelpick combo would be great I wanted it to be small and packable this definitely fits the bill I dug 4 holes about 8 in diameter approximately 5 deep in my back yard and on the fourth hole the shovel blade bent It bent like a spoon in hard cold ice cream Clean in the middle of the blade close to 90 degrees I bent it back but once its been compromised its a lost cause My back yard is sod and the dirt is slightly clay like its not dry or hard but very slightly on the heavy side I was in complete disbelief when it bent and flat out angry when I saw just how bad it was with as little power as I had applied The locking ring also did not hold the shovel head solidly from the beginning It never had a positive lock The pick does hold firm but not the shovel After the second hole I dug the shovel head would not stay in position at all and I had to keep forward pressure on it so it wouldnt fold while pushing it into the ground The steel used is very low quality It doesnt matter if you harden it like they state in the description because low quality steel just wont get hard enough as is the case with the low carbon junk steel used here I could have done better using a decent hard wood stick to dig the holes and that is absolutely not an exaggeration Lasted 3 and a half small holes in not so tough ground About 3 minutes of total use Steer clear folks this one is garbage 
Perfect for the beach Took 5 min to set up bc its only 3 poles Should have taken a hammer for stakes lol 
Packed for trip to Hawaii  worked out great to shade us from the sun Can fit 3 adults side by side 2 very comfortably Was easy to set up with 2 people And loved that it fit in our checked luggage so we didnt have to spent 80 a day to rent an umbrella and chairs 
Got this to keep on my 26 sailboat Is it the most wonderful and quality product Probably not Will it work for camping and on a boat Yes Id get it again 
Still using this 
Great dish set for camping 
This is your basic single burner propane outdoor stove It works with 1 lb propane bottles for portability and with an adapter hose can be connected to a 20 lb propane tank I use one of these regularly and enjoy using it If you get one here are a couple of tips 1 Get a Stove Tamernbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefStoveTamer6dpB000I1X3TGrefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTF8Stove Tamer 6a so that you can use smaller pots tin cups etc or to simply have better control over the heat It will allow you to get a better low temp simmer without worrying about the stove blowing out 2 The pot rack will pull free from the plasitc legs allowing you to give the stove a good cleaning without working around the rack Once its dissasembled in this manner you can throw it in the sink and wash it like you would any other pan I used one of these on the patio all summer for making coffee in the morning and side dishes when grilling out I did not have any problems Prior to purchasing this stove I used a Coleman FoldNGo Since I never needed two burners on the patio I packed the two burner stove with the camping gear and use this guy exclusively 
I am a pretty avid hikercamper We needed a burner that could use those readily available propane tanks This one works great and does not take up too much space Even better it uses the same fuel as our light uses I have also used this at the home to steam clams and mussels to avoid smelling up the house Boils water very quickly and was great to cook on 
This portable stove is larger than I expected but works like a charm I use this on camping trips and for tailgating and it takes a real beating in my gear bag The only thing which other reviewers mention is the lack of a wind shield You can easily make one so I do not consider this a negative 
I was very happy with how easy this is to use My husband and I do a lot of camping I needed an easy way for me to boil water and heat dips and things I have to have my coffee and I use folgers sinngles when we go camping I needed to be able to heat the water without help from my husband and before I had my coffee Due to arthritis I need my husbands help to open a can of soda I can use this burner with ease which was just what I was looking for It is big enough to work with a large skillet and boils water very quickly for a propane set up I highly recommend this product 
Great Lantern had it up and running within 10min of it arriving Only negative is the case has a real flimsy locking mechanism Every time I carry it in the case I feel like Im just waiting for the bottom to fall out I think its made more to protect the lantern in storage then for actually carrying it around despite the handle 
This lamp is wonderful It cranks out the light just like the ancient one my father had while I was growing up when we went camping The only problem is the way Coleman designed the case the lamp is protected in The way the case closes at the base makes it extremely vulnerable to opening up on you and the lamp sliding out while carrying it as described by previous reviewers In my opinion the flaws in the case design should not keep you from ordering the lamp and case set I use a strip of duck tape across the bottom or a small Bungie Cord looped to the handle to hold the base on securely Hopefully Coleman will check these reviews and redesign the case closure to alleviate the problem of unexpected opening The lamp is traditional Coleman Quality and worth the purchase I recommend this lamp and case set 
Perfect Very easy set up and tear down Compact and convenient 
Coleman Tent Kit  great addition to any tent set 
The rubber mallet is great the stake puller is great both worked better than expected I didnt use the tent stakes because I camped in sand so I used long rebar stakes I think I will upgrade the whisk broom because it was a bit small and ineffective but it probably needed to be to fit in the handydandy bag I love the mesh bags for camping equipment they make it easier to organize pack and identify the contents 
Great tool kit if your a hardcore camper like myself Keeps everything you need for setting up the tents in 1 place and you are less likely to forget things like the hammer I did that once 
Excellent product Fast shipping A 
I didnt expect myself using the dust pan at all but that has become the most used item in the bunch Very helpful in cleaning out a tent while camping I find the mallet unnecessary and very big I tend to just rely on finding rocks to hammer the posts in The carying bag is kinda junk but everything else seems well made 
Nice little military style shovel 
perfect thank you 
Awesome set to camp with The butter knife will double as steak knife No need in carrying extra set of knife 
Great set for the price Have used some parts a dozen times while camping in our RV Some of the cups have started to get rust in them despite always washing and drying 
great Glamping set was lightweight and easy to clean 
Perfect 
Love this kit great quality nice utensils and works great for camping Just with it came with a case or better box as my box got wet and is falling apart I like to try to keep things that come in boxes is the boxes if possible otherwise I tend to lose things 
I use this stove almost exclusively over my two burner Coleman stove I like the smaller size and that it does not have wind screens  you can use larger pans with this stove The fire has good control from low to high The only reason it did not get five stars is the grate could use a bit of redesign  more support for small pots would be nice 
This stove works well just like all the Coleman propane stoves Ive ever owned I was hoping to find a compact propane stove and unfortunately this is about as small as they get from what Ive seen Its about the size of a large dinner plate so yes you can put it in your backpack but it will take up most of the space At least its about half the size of a two burner stove If you really want a compact stove for backpacking this is not the one to get but its still a nice durable stove that puts out a lot of heat and uses the very cheap and common 1pound propane cylinders as opposed to the more specialized fuels that most ultralights require 
not a shovel for digging a hole to china but works good for creating a minnow hole in creek bent the tip but that was my fault 
Cheap not very strong 
Very easy to set up and take down and almost easily able to get it back in the bag solo with a baby 
VERY GOOD 
you know those POS little aluminum wire rods that you get with your tent throw those tooth picks away and buy this 
Very helpful I am pleased with it 
Great kit Never tented before and everything was here and so easy to use The case is a bonus to keeping things organized Arrived quickly and packaged well 
Bought these and some glow in the dark stakes worked good the pull out tool is weak and bends easly but the rest of the kit is great 
Good quality items in this kit Mallet is heavy and tough and the whisk broom was a nice touch Bag is tough and well made 
We used this set on our camping vacation Everything held up well and was easy to wash I wish it had a carrying case though 
A pretty good set for what you get Silverware  We used this summer quite a bit The knives are almost too sharp but I am sure they will dull over time Dishware  It is made of metal keep it out of the microwave It did not chip over the summer  a Star because it is metal I saw many negative reviews and held off on mine to see how it did Overall Happiness 
Gave as a gift You cant go wrong with Coleman 
Works great Weve brought these on about 4 camping trips now and they wash up super easy We do avoid putting them in the dish washer when we get home just due to notes about enamel chipping and as a result they still look new Only complaint is that the mugs get VERY hot for coffee but thats kind of the price you pay with enamel 
Everything was amazing in this set sadly one plate had a tiny chip but we plan to use it regardless I bet was a shipping thing great for a group of four 
It is small however a perfect size for your bug out bag I gave it a four stars because of the locking mechanism I would prefer a dedicated shovel instead of the weak pivot point just retighten it Another good shovel is the GLOCK Entrenching Tool 
I prefer that it has screw on sections instead of folding It lessens the chance of bending IMO Stays small in my pack which is why I like this one 
I was impressed when I received it but went to use it and bent it just below the rivets Good price but you need to know that the shovel is small and best used in the 90 degree position as per the picture plus do not put much pressure on it 
Well made solid hand shovel But its marginally bigger than a garden hand shovel I bought it to throw in my truck and Im not sure itll be up to any task I give it Advertising is a bit misleading when it said its 23 long You expect a larger tool 
great once its up pain to put up 
It did his job during our summer beach vacation 
Great kit for the price Everything very functional especially the stakes All tools fit in the case well 
Good to have but not perfect 
These are great for camping Easy to use and clean The silverware doesnt fall apart and is made well The knives are sharp enough to cut steak which is great so we dont have to bring another set of knives I like the case the silverware comes in because it makes it easier for me to stay organized on the trip Now if I could just get everyone to put their silverware in the case rather than me doing it that would be great 
Good stuff Only used it three or four times so far but no complaints 
coleman is always good especially with dual fuel 
The Lantern its self is good The case  meh  better watch out about the case Cause it could easily let the lantern fall out Not a good design for being reliable The case needs a locking closedsecure ability Ill probably be adding my own failsafe modification to the case 
The lantern looks nice and well put together and so forth I have many Coleman lanterns and this looks to be a nice addition to the stable I was a bit surprised that it came a bit beat up The metal piece that supports the glass was bent up so much that I had to bend it down to get the globe in The handle was bent Its all still functional but its just a bit surprising to take something brand new out of the box and see it a bit beat up Even as I was opening the Amazon box I thought to myself that the packaging wasnt well done and that might have caused the problems Its not bad enough to return but just a bit disappointing 
This is the best bang for your buck if you want a new GPA lantern It is fuel efficient and there is no noticeable difference in light output between this and the powerhouse I have both and have run them side by side The Northstar is a brighter lantern but you could buy 2 of these for the price of one of those Notice that I am ignoring the propane models I find them to be wasteful on fuel and their cold weather performance is lacking The only downside is they dont sell these in green paint anymore This is my go to lantern for camping and emergencies I recommend trying some peerless mantles with this lantern They appear to be as bright or brighter than the colemans and more durable 
This item arrived promptly from amazon Thought I would share that it does come with filtered funnel even though it was not in description The only down side to this whole package was the case If is ok and does the job but kinda flimsy and funnel is very difficult to fit in case but can be done For just over 50 and free shipping price is right and like that you can use unleaded gasoline or coleman fuel I have an coleman fuel Green later but thought it would be nice to keep it as a back up and use this to save cost and not carry extra fuel for an atv outing I recommend this over propane because easier to carry a small container of unleaded gasoline in a pack that propane bottles and cheaper Hope this review helps 
Very intense white light I cant offer much more than other reviewers except a couple of learning curve issues I had First take out the plungerprimer stem before first use then reinsert it I found that mine had an air pocket in it that would not let me prime it properly I got some fuel primed but it just didnt seem bright Once air pocket cleared and properly primed I noticed the hiss was much louder and the light was very intense Secondly I find that Crown fuel from the big box store burns brighter than gasoline It is also half the cost of what the Coleman fuel is Plus if you spill some it doesnt smell nearly as bad or as long as gasoline Awesome lantern that you can pass down for generations Did I mention it has a very intense white light This will certainly light up your camp 
Have had some issues with the internal jet and had to replace it It burns very bright but you have to keep aware of maintaining pressure with the pump when on the brighter settings The carrying case makes me nervous the way it closes that it may open up allowing the lantern to fall possibly damaging it I have not tested it with unleaded gasoline yet but am overall happy with this lantern 
Good beach tent for the money 
For the price the tool is what it is It may only last a few years with me but thought Id give it a shot Seems durable but for a landscaper who does a lot of planting this should work for a couple years 
I am a Boy Scout leader I got this tool to replace our old shovel for camping It is well built but to small for any real digging It is not much better the a large garden trowel 
VERY USEFUL TOOL FOR CAMPINGYARD WORK OR JUST TO KEEP IN THE BUGOUT BAG FOR AN EMERGENCYTHINKING ABOUT GETTING ONE FOR THE CAR AS WELL 
It weights 18 ounces doesnt list that on the item page Also you dont need the handle extension so you can make it a few ounces lighter The construction seems pretty solid Going to test it out test in out in a couple days so if there are any issues I will abridge my review EDIT After 45 uses on soft ground the shovel had difficulty staying extended and consequently kept folding up Maybe I just got a bad model but Im not impressed 
Worked as expected Nothing else to really say 
Great addition to have 
Stakes broom and mallet are all perfect The bag is basically useless other than shipping Getting the broom and stakes in and out of it is a chore My primary complaint is the stake puller It has no strength It bent on my first pull It is a great idea and the reason I got the kit I needed the stakes but wanted the puller If it were stronger it would be a winner 
Just burn camp fuel only burn regular gas if you NEED to used mine for numerous hours without any issues Bugs will start to collect in the bottom so you will need to clean out the crispy critters from time to time If you catch 1 going in you can turn up the heat and cook it Most taste like peanut butter 
To soon to tell for sure but first impression are good Works great is smaller than my 220f and much brighter 
I havent actually tried to light it yet so Im worried after reading the negative reviews My personal complaint so far is that the carry case has an amazingly weak and selfdefeating latch 
Not bad for the money 
Great quality product Love the colour The picture is true to the colour 
Its great for clearing the ground for the camp fire and digging small holes The shovel is only big as my hand but its very light and compact to carry Its not for digging large ditches handles are two pieces and the whole kit fits in a 6 12 in x 3 12 in pouch 
I did not purchase either of my compact shovels from Amazon however they are the exact same shovels Just yesterday a sanded and repainted one of them That is why I looked them up to remind me what they cost I filed and sharpened the edges and removed the rust that had started on the digging area The black had come off and the rust had started to take hold If I waited much longer the project would be a BIG one But as it was it was a fun one  Value If you search for the best product for your buck then the buck does indeed stop here These are VALUEable little dudes to havecarry in your pack BoB or vehicle I have had them for years and used them often in gardening especially They last forever They are a carbon steel  not SS This means they do require some cleaning and a little oil once in a while unless you are just going to use abuse and dispose of them At the price point you could still get your moneys worth Butwhy This is STEEL and a darn good product It can easily rise from the ashes a new shovel SOMETIMES the handle etc can get loose because of the way the segmented handle part screw together But this is more of a minor irritation when one considers the positive aspects of what you getfor what you paid 
The pictures are deceiving The blade is about the same size as my hand Could one use this thing to dig a hole Sure Just dont be in a hurry And dont need a big one I would sent this back except it doesnt take up a lot of space and will probably work in a pinch Mechanically it is very nice The serrated edge wont make it to the level of being a joke It is nothing more than wiggles in the side of the blade The blade has been somewhat sharpened But there really wasnt a lot of effort put into it The grips are decent The next time I will definitely take a close look at the overall dimensions 
Love using this at the beach Have leant it to friends who loved it as well The shade and privacy is wonderful especially on crowded beaches Perfect for small children to get out of the sun Assembly did take a bit of time 
The wire is a very stiff piece of metal sort of serrated part that can I would be polite in saying in absolute emergencies can be used to cut pieces of wood Although your hand and arm might as well fall off while in the process of cutting because of fatigue I would say a waste of money 
What a piece of garbage Coleman should recall this saw or change the label to christmas ornament The reason people buy these is for emergencysurvival situations Thank god i test everything first I started to cut a 1 inch branchabout a quarter of the way through it began to smoke I stopped to see what was going on and the saw was so hot it burned my hand I waited for it to cool down then tried again Not even half way through the saw became so hot it broke in half Unless you plan on hanging this from your christmas tree do not buy it 
Its small The blade part is about the size of the palm of my hand Its kind of heavy for its size I took it to the Buffalo River for a canoeing camping trip Size and weight were a consideration Altogether Im happy It was perfect for scooping sand onto a fire to extinguish it as well as digging latrines Very compact but also very sturdy once assembled Saw is useless thats why I bought the Gerber 46048 Sportsmans wood saw Didnt use the pick When folded up in the pouch it will fit easily in a cargo pants pocket or stick it in your pack 
the shovel is about the size of mans hand as someone else had said i am not digging a hole to china so this is small and compact perfect in my bob 
nice 
It sucks 
Great set everything you need to grub 
Great product 
I bought this and it arrived damaged so I didnt take it on our trip When we got back from our trip we could no longer return it Very disappointing 
Great little set High quality and packs up real nice 
Family laughed and called us city slickers when we brought our little kit along to camp but not soon enough they were borrowing it Very sturdy useful and small enough to squeeze into my camping bag Not to mention affordable 
Okay Not necessary But it was nice to have it along on our trips Our little was cleaning and loved it 
Slicks bend easier then expected 
This kit worked great with our lightspeed pop up canopy The nails come with plastic caps keep them to put back on for storage The mesh bag is very cheap quality and is the only complaint The brush is not too stiff but not useless floppy either I did not use the dust pan buy like how they nest together Keep the flimsy plastic bag the brush and dustpan came in to use for easier reinsertion into the mesh bag The mallet works greak on the included nails and my plastic stakes that came with the canopy And the stake puller worked great I wasnt forceful as Ive read it bends just take your time and wiggle the stake out 
This lantern is one of several upgraded changes that have been made since my 288 model was made in February 1987 It is the same size because it fits in this case which I just ordered for my 288 dont want to rush into things 5 stars for Coleman Support I just got the new number for the generator for my 288 remember I said made in1987 They sent me an email with my case number so I can get back with them by return email They even offer Repair Service on these lanterns that were made from 1927 to present Whatever the Coleman product is I had a replacement part sent out for my Coleman pool No Hassle Polite and Knowledgable Yeah with that kind of support This puppy is goin on my wish list Cmon next paycheck 
Works very well 
great for the money 
I bought this at an athletics store due to the price  it was the least expensive one there Boy was it a waste of a purchase The shovel is very small about 35 smaller than my SOG entrenching tool What I dislike most about it however was the handle The upper handle unscrews for a compact fit but the threading was terrible It took several tries to line it up and when I did it felt shoddy and unstable Also when taking it apart it was very stiff and took a considerable amount of effort to undo There are much better entrenching tools out there I would recommend spending the few extra dollars if you can 
any review that speaks of this shovelpick being small as a negative clearly doesnt understand this is for backpacking small compact enough weight to trust the durability its the best backpacking shovel i could hope to find good price too 
Dont waist your money Its junk Find yourself a Military folding shovel and I dont mean a Military type made in china It will serve you much better for much longer 
The silverware is very poor quality therefore we give only four stars The cups and dishes are nice The forks are terrible The fork is almost straight and you cant hold food on it very well The knifes were nice and sharp that was good 
For the price these are pretty good They are fairly light and probably wont last years but Im sure theyll last a few summers worth of camping 
I have this set purchased years ago in my camping gear Its great and my family has used it regularly without problem I just repurchased this set because for complicated reasons we need to maintain 2 sets of camping gear and the new one was falling apart as we received it We noticed right away that one of the cups had a big corroded spot We put that aside thinking it was an anomaly maybe a previous purchased had burned it and returned the set But no quickly the rest of the dishes were showing signs of corrosion and wear and tear far beyond the few meals we had put them through What the heck Coleman You used to make great stuff These went back to Amazon for a refund 
Cheaply made the powder coating on nearly EVERYTHING chips off super easily Coleman products have sort of gone down the tube and are cheap one time use products almost So sad to see  
Cups are metal so they are hot to the touch with coffee or tea but overall happy with the quality and durability 
There is a reason coleman fuel lanterns used to be stamped Sunshine of the Night they blast away at the darkness with retinasearing levels of light Truly impressive dead simple and cheap to run The new northstar line may put out more light but uses harder to find and  mantles I say stick with lanterns that use the old tie on mantles 2021 While youre at it stick with liquid fuelers instead of propane profane Yes you have to pay attention when working with a liquid fuel lantern but its excellent practice for life itself Teach your kid how to operate a lantern safely and change hisher life for the better My oldest Coleman lantern is 48 yrs old at this point and I still use it weekly I dont know if my new one will last that long but if it does it will outlive me 
We bought this lantern for my son and daughterinlaw last winter These newer lanterns have plastic parts in the pump that some reviews I read considered inferior to the older metal versions The pricing at Amazon at the time offered such a bargain that I decided to buy a new lantern rather than search for a good used one with metal pump I picked up a case extra mantles funnel and Coleman fuel at my local REI store We fueled up the lantern and it fired right up After the new mantles settled down the lantern operated as my older versions do The intended purpose of this gift lantern is to provide emergency lighting so Im not sure how good a test the newer version pump will get Initially it was fine 
This lantern is a very good finding burns few fuel produces much light 
Top notch 
My son likes this 
Good 
I imagine the lantern works fine but its very difficult to put in the case and there is no place for the filter I really liked the metal case of years ago when I camped every night I havent tried the lantern with gasoline yet I downgraded the lanterncase due to the case Coleman bring back the metal case 
You need it if you want to setup your camp easily 
Bought this for my son as a basic starter kit for his camping experience This was his 1st venture into his own equipment and this was a good kit for that 
Used with great results at Burning Man 
As the majority of other reviewers noted this thing will likely break withing a few minutes I gave it a try on a 2 dead branch and although I felt it cut satisfactorily for its size it broke on a second smaller cut of the same branch for a total of about 2 minutes use If you want to rely on this product I suggest cutting very slow with minimal pressure and dont let it get hot in other words dont bet your life on this 
what would u expect with a wire saw It snapped after a few pulls but i wasnt shocked or surprised its thin wire with key rings on the end Held up a little better when fastened to a curved branch as a bow saw but still sucked Im sticking with a folding saw and hatchet 
I purchased several to give to my scouts as a FUN survival tool Good thing I tested it out first I broke two in 10 minutes The 1st may have been defective so I gave it another chance with a second The problem is that the cutting wire is very thin and weakens with every pull because it heats up from the friction cutting action until it eventually fails breaks I did try different kinds of wood hardwood softer pine dead dry limbs and on living tree branches wet All test branches were less than 2 inches in diameter The only way it could work without breaking is not practical  go so slow as not to create heat It would take more than an hour to cut through 1 inch OR you could bend and break the 1 inch diameter twig 
Minus one star above I got this for my son because he likes bushcraft and all that outdoor type of gear like dad Well you can imagine what happened it broke it split in the middle during the first use on a twig lol I knew it would but figured my son could get a few uses out of it I got it at A academy like the other poster on here did Anyways i did notice there are different types of these mini wire saws like the sportsmans and the commando I would just go out and buy a real chain and attach two ends to hold it with if your looking for some type of back up The whole point of me posting is so you dont waste your money I wouldnt take this if it were free lets put it that way  
you would expect with a name like coleman that this would be a good piece of equipment it is at best a one time use thing 
The product is less than hoped for but the vendor was terrific         
I got this at Academy Sports for 2 It cuts slowly and it broke in the first 30 seconds of use Just dont waste your money with this The wire is about the same as a guitar string 
ok 
The reason I give this 2 stars is because its good for a couple of uses but the pieces wear down and the shovel just becomes a giant spoon after multiple uses I bought a Gerber folding shovel for 2000 plus shipping and its held up great I would suggest the Gerber as a long term camping tool 
I didnt pay close enough attention to the size of the shovel so it is a bit smaller than I was hoping I have used it a couple of times though and it is very heavy duty and gets the job done It comes with a nice little bag to put it in so it stores nicely in my trunk Some day I may need it and it will be there 
As everyone as mentioned  this is a very small shovel The head is not much larger than my hand However I wanted to put one in each of my vehicles and on my snowmobile and ATV in case of an emergency and they are perfect for that application They fold up into a tiny case  but appear to be well constructed of decent metal 
I have seen other reviewers reviews about the size of the shovel It is small but it does exactly what I bought it to do When I get stuck I can easily pull out this little thing and dig myself out And as much as I hate to admit it Ive done that more times than I should admit It has been sturdy enough and large enough for my husband to use to dig a small hole as well If you are looking for a larger shovel that is more shovel like in size this is not it If you are looking for something that is small easy to store and sturdy enough to dig a small hole this is a good one to have 
This is a good little tool to take along with you on hikingbackpacking trips or to dig a SMALL trench around your tent if camping in order to redivert rain water It also comes with its own carrying pouch that easily slips onto any style belt I suggest matching the belt size to the belt loop of the carrying pouch otherwise this tool will dangle about and flop around while walking I bought mine a Cabelas so I paid a little extra for it This tool is also good to keep inside your car especially during winter If you get stuck on an icy road this tool will chip the ice quite nicely Ive read some of the reviews stating that this tool is heavy doesnt stay connected or they hurt themselves with it True this tool does weigh little more than the advertized pound thats because it is made out of steel and steel tends to be heavy This tool when everything is screwed together tightly does loosen itself over continued use it wasnt designed to go prospecting for gold digging a grave or such You might actually have to stop what you are doing and periodically retighten the connections Read another review that someone hurt them selves with this item well good for you dumb a He was most likely utilizing this item in an unsafe manner Overall this little shovel will do what you need it to do provided that you are safety concious Mine works just fine for digging the emergency poo parlors while hikingbackpacking Believe it or not that is what this little tools intended purpose was The only complaint that I actulally have with this tool is that its carrying pouch ripped quite easily but that was most likely my fault for I was crawling through a narrow tunnel while caving and forgot about having this tool on my tool belt and it got caught on some rocks 
You cannot be a responsible backpacker and not have a shovel or pick to bury your personal waste This device weights a little more than just one pound and is easily cleaned and even fits into its own lightweight bag To be responsible whenever backpacking one should always dig a privy pit at least a foot deep and preferably deeper Trying to use sticks or rocks to dig is silly This is too lightweight and too handy to not bring on any trip It is also really handy for digging trenches around your tent when you expect rain The pick is especially handy in heavy and hardpacked soils Clean up after yourself Leave no trace 
Coleman is a quality standard that you expect things from I think that for nine dollars you would have to be extremely stingy not to buy this The quality is easily worth 20 dollars or more I recommend buying this because it seems like something that you could store anywhere and use more than once I completely recommend this product for this price Too bad walmart offers the same price without shipping  
works good if you fold the blade all the way out and use it as a shovel otherwise it wiggles loose after some use The carry pouch leaves a lot to be desired and its a tad too heavy for my liking 
Great Attractive and met our needs 
Great set for our family and nicely finished Just wished it came with a container to store them We just retained the original box 
gift 
Only the hammer and the stakes are worth anything in this kit but it was still worth the price 
Set up the tent the essential tool set combination affordable and convenient 
This is a decent little pack of items that are useful when camping The brush and pan are a little smaller than I had imagined but they do the job The bag that the items came in is handy to keep all of the stuff in as well as other pegs for the tent 
Great lantern Bright and as good as the OLD ones 
nice 
Used for camping in the mountains no issues Great buy 
Easy setup works well as per the Coleman standard Weve been using Coleman products stoves lamps and tents for 30 plus years and they never disappoint The included directions are easy if you arent familiar with the product and Coleman customer service is pretty good if you have questions or issues as is Amazon 
This is total junk seems well built but wont function properly Very hard to get going and once lit puts out a pathetic amount of light Coleman used to be a name brand you could trust now I will go out of my way to avoid their products Complete waste of money 
Ok it has been over 30 years since my father used one just like this lantern With periodic blackouts this is a very handy safeguard that is much more useful than any flashlight 
I have been using a coleman later for over 20 yrs so why change now I have the old one and a new one They have never let me down in any weather  Thanks for a very good product 
I grew up around this lantern while camping and wanted one of my own for a very long time It burns very bright with an easily adjustable dimmer If you want a real camping experience ditch the LED lanterns and pick this baby up It comes with two mantels that are easy to tie on and prime I dont see any problems with the build quality of these later coleman lanterns The pump does have some plastic parts but oil it once a year and dont put crappy fuel gasoline kerosene in it and itll last forever Yes it is a little noisy slight hissing sound not a big deal and yes it gets very hot Its a lantern for cryin out loud Dont touch it dont put it in your tent and dont leave it burning in some grass However do let your kids touch it once and then youll never have to worry about it again Thats what my dad did and I learned my lesson quick 55 stars cause its be best lantern youll ever buy 
I burn I burn very very easily My wife goes outside for five minutes and gets a fantastic tan Im a little bitter about that but hey we all have our shortcomings Mine is that I crisp instead of tan Our new apartment is about a 15 minute walk to the beach and with her being from Virginia Beach she loves the water I decided to search around and find something that might spare me the agony of sitting on the beach for more than five minutes and I found this Why the green color is cheaper than the others is beyond me but a slight discount is a slight discount so I went for it Maybe theres better colors out there but given the sea of lime green beach shades Ive seen so far at the beach Id say were all cheap and want to save what we can The design is a bit tricky for me Ive put together various tents my whole life and this one is a bit of a challenge Personally I think the fabric tube for the crosstube that goes longways across the shade is much to narrow and it makes it tricky to get the pole to successfully stay in one piece while youre trying to set up the shade Im sure the more I use this the more Ill figure out its quirks but I wasnt particularly pleased spending a massive amount of time putting this small thing together and ripping some of the mesh tube when Ive put an 8 person tent together in what seemed like a much shorter amount of time The quality of the shade other than the narrow pole tubes is great We spent several hours in the shade and it was very comfortable The attached flooring is a nice touch though sand will get everywhere and if youre wet from the water when you sit down itll pool and sand will stick I think next time well place towels down first The stakes were great quality and Im thrilled they were metal instead of plastic The included bags to store everything were also wellmade and with some patience aka giving my wife the tent and bag the whole thing did end up fitting back into the storage tote I will mention that even with the window in the back and the entrance to the tent being open it does get pretty warm in there It wasnt unbearable but I did end up ordering two small batteryoperated fans anyway to help circulate some air Im sure the majority of people wont need to do that but if youre like me and you sweat and become very warm easily then you may want to invest in some cheap fans Im super happy with this so far and it has absolutely made my trips to the beach much more fun and much less painful so for that Im very grateful 
Im glad we got this one Its wellmade and designed but the mesh sleeves for the poles should be solid The curved mesh catches on the metal ferrules and separates the links Weve been using cabanas for almost 20 years and love it This is the biggest and 6 too big for the beach we are headed to in height and width Beach police beware If its too high I will scoop 6 of sand out below it A TRICK for setting it up solo  take at least 3 medium rubber bands along When you get the rod through band the rod to the tab with the grommet on it so it wont pop out as soon as you turn your back to work on the other end SO much easier I struggled in the living room on the test run before I remembered this The dogs simulated the wind and other problems on the beach And Im so glad they didnt send the one with the big lantern printed on the sides That seemed a bit much For all those who dont like the mesh sleeves  you could cut a long strip of nylon fabric the length of the pole sleeves and sew it into a tube  which would go inside the mesh sleeves You may need to sew it to the ends of the sleeve maybe more than that A pain  but it would eliminate the mesh problem A small rubber ball stuck on the fwd end of the pole may help too but the problem is when the ferrules catch and the segments separate AFTER using the tent and seeing how wrong the mesh sleeves are for the poles to go thru I went to Lowes and got 5 of 12OD plastic waterline not pvc And I glued a cap on one end Now I start the tube in the sleeve then push it the rest of the way through with the pole Then pull the tube out the other end This will save the mesh But really  dont they make designers try these things out The mesh will quickly puncture with the poles as designed The tent was nice with no problems you might want to put the filled sand bags in ziplock bags They dont hold sand that well The carrying bag was well made and the tent fit back in But what would it cost them to add an inch of material to make it easier Another tip  a strip of plastic or cardboard for when you zip the bag up This will stop the zipper from grabbing the tent as you need one hand to pinch the sides together and one to zip 
This will be great for the family 

All I expected 
Nice set and is made well 
Handy item to have with camping Comes in a net bag to hold all the kit items 
helpful with sun shade for kids at beach 
nice addition to our new tent 
Great 
NICE for your casual camper I bought this only for the stakes The other stuff is nice to have too though I use the broom and dustpan to sweep up my cats litter that comes out of the box 
I would expect a better quality from Coleman Its just OK 
Would have been a 5 star but it came with a mesh pouch not the tarp material pictured Tent stakes kept going through it 
Great Product  
Easy to set up and use I love the dual fuel capability 
Great Coleman product like usual 
Its a Coleman It should outlive me with the exception of the glass if I get clumsy Works awesome for those camping nights in the screened in room playing cards 
Works good 


Works as advertised and fast shipping 
The mallet is ok but the stakes are not very good and the puller is useless I used this once as I couldnt find my stakes and I needed something in a hurry The stakes were fine going into the ground The plastic part around the top of the stakes start to come off when you begin to pull them up The puller is practically useless If you look at it any kind of torque on the puller causes it to bend open The dustpan and broom is a little small for most tasks but is ok to brush up a little bit of the dirt from your tent The mallet was used throughout the rest of the summer as well and handled fine but I dont think this whole kit is worth it If you are in a pinch I suppose it would do 
rubber mallet chipped on first use Agree with other users that it is very hard to get the broom back in the bag as the bristles always catch on the mesh Be careful pulling the tent stakes as the plastic tabs can break off fairly easily 
Hammer is great Puller upper thing is great  works really well actually better than a nail hammer Dust pan thing is great Bag sucks You will spend more time getting these things out of that small mesh bag then using them 
works great easy to use and comes in a nice carry bay I love it 
I bought this as an addon thinking I wouldnt use it much I was wrong The rubber mallet was great for really sinking in tent stakes without bending them like a metal hammer would The little wisk and dust pan was also really helpful for getting sand out of the tent I didnt need the extra stakes on this trip but I was happy to have them The stake puller is pretty nice as well Not sure if I would ever take this backpacking but it will go with me every time I car camp 
very nice set to have with you while camping easy to clean and utensils are very sturdy and good 
bought this for our camper and love the red color and is very sturdy 
Good for the price I can tell it wont last forever but its a solid camping product 
Last a long time and fun to use Not having to keep special fuel for these is a huge bonus generally always have gas for lawn mowers etc so nice to be able to use that 
Works great Its a Coleman What more can be said 
Great Lantern that trows a lot of light This lantern is well built and the additional carrying storage case is a real plus I have run it using both Coleman Fuel and Kerosene and it worked equally well regardless of fuel 
Nice lantern put it together and it works great Fast delivery great product 
Good buy 
Hammer works stake heads can be better built Broom and dust pan are worthless and specially the extractor Its made for shorter stakes If used with what it comes with 10in Stakes it will bend and will brake off the stake head too Not worth it I gave it 2 stars cause of the hammer and stakes 
Nice idea but the items are child size for a childs tent in the back yard  nothing beyond that 
Awesome kit Comes with wonderful items  a stake puller and a mallet What tent camper doesnt need those The only thing we didnt like was the broom and dust pan  we went and bought a larger set at Home Depot for around 3 to keep our tent swept 
MUST HAVE FOR A TENT 
1 After taking it all of the way to Florida for our vacation upon opening the product one of the black tent poles was defective One of the two black poles was missing a metal ferrule in the middle of the pole assemble meaning the pole did not lock together I guess i should have checked before taking it all of the way to Florida but I did not because you know  it always takes up a bit more space after repacking 2 After going through the warranty process Coleman sent a Tent Pole Replacement Kit This kit was several other fiberglass poles an elastic cord end tips and ferrules SOME ASSEMBLY REQUIRED and I had to make my own replacement pole with the kit I had to cut the poles to the correct size with a hacksaw thread the elastic cord and add the end caps myself 3 The replacement poles are thicker than the original and as a result the assembled pole is more rigid than the other black pole meaning the assembled shade is now lopsided 4 The four replacement pole segments when folded for storage are too long to be stored in the carrying case Even though the total length of the pole when assembled is the correct length Originally there were five pole segments and the replacement kit has four NOT happy 
Love this set It has everything you need takes up little to no space just the box and it was easy to wash because of the material and kept our food hot or cold depending on what it was 
Bought this as a gift for friends and his two kids who love camping 
I should preface this review though by saying that the lantern I received was defective It wouldnt dim Anything other than full power brightness and the lantern would slowly fade out until it was extinguished Instead of going through Amazon I decided to contact Coleman to see if I could get replacement parts Im pretty handy so Id rather just fix it After explaining to them the issue they opted just to replace the lantern outright 100 for free under warranty Excellent customer service and it saves me the hassle of having to fix the old one I purchased this lantern for a long car camping trip from the west coast to the east coast Weve used it 3 times in the last month or so This thing is built like a tank Very robust quite heavy and works very well I couldnt imagine anyone needing the PowerHouse model as this standard model is PLENTY bright enough My only complaint is that the older design that includes a generator cleaner knob is absent from this modern design I suppose it makes it simpler to use but it loses a facet of long term reliability in my opinion Even still I cannot recommend this lantern enough Its excellent 
piece of  Does not stay on does not hold the pressure Get one with propane or electric LED and rechargeable batteries Even a torch is better 
This lantern seems to be a lot quieter than my 20 year old Coleman lanterns This is a great lantern Beware the carry case has to be snapped in completely If not the lantern will fall out 
The hammer came apart but the rest is OK 
Nice little addon item Nice little tent brush I would only suggest adding 2 or 4 more stakes The bag has plenty of room for the four additional ones we bought Not many tents use only four stakes 
Everything works well 

The enamel was chipped off several of the items when package arrived The package was not damaged and you could tell it was packaged damaged because the packaging around the items inside the box was not damaged either Also says made in China Not exactly pleased And I typically like Coleman products I returned it today same day I received it 
LIght heat in the winter Easy to operate Cheap solution to losing the power runs for 9 hours on one filling of Coleman fuel Good addition to anyones Bug Out Kit too 
Ive used this lantern for years while camping in Virginia This is a great lantern and case set The lantern is made in the USA and puts off great light I use two of these to light our camp site and our foodcooking area The case is nice and sturdy Keeps the lantern clean and safe while in storage Im not sure what people are doing wrong Ive never had an issue with these cases failing Maybe they are putting the lantern in incorrectly or forget the click the tabs into place Anyway Im seriously considering a third 
Left my hammer and had a crappy ax Used the mallet to hammer the ax to chop wood and surprisingly it held up very well Used a couple of the stakes for sure are better than what comes with some tents 
Five day campout these were awesome Just wish the cups stacked But theyre nice and they work and the price isnt terrible Worth it for car campers 
Holds food 
At first I was very impressed however as I was repackaging the mugs I noticed a large chip come off the rim of the mug after I slightly hit the counter with it Not so durable afterall 
second hand dinnerware enamel missing on some items 
Love these Ordered two sets for my camp gear They are beautiful and sturdy 
Mallet mesh bag dustpan and brush are all nice touches The tent spike remover is a nice idea but poorly executed Mine bends every time I remove a spike That said the overall package seems reasonably well thought out and compact 
Wished so much I could rate this with five stars but its not even been unpacked yet still have not gone camping yet but when we do I will come back and do this review the right way good or bad 
good 
Good price for quality product 
Did not hold pressure Sold the lantern and kept the case I bought a older green one at a yard sale it works good and holds pressure Fits in the case 
Super bright and long lasting One thing I didnt realize with these though is how much heat comes out of the top The handle gets super hot so youd really only want to hang it from a metal hook The plastic case is nice but the closure mechanism is cheap Im not sure how long it will last 
Just like I remembered as a kid camping Gives off plenty of light Easy to use and adjust No charging or keeping up with batteries Ive had battery powered lanterns and this blows them away 
bright and lasted all night filled it up pumped it and used it for hours then put it next to the tent opening for the kids late night bathroom breaks and lasted all night was still lit in the morning a good 8 hours later and the hard case fits nicely only wish it has a spot for the funnel you can use to fill it 
Good product for camping and securing your tent 
broom is only good for small tents everything else in this set is a must have It is a good value too considering the cost of the mallet and stakes bought seperately 
Exactly what I was looking for Thank you 
Should last a life time 
Was just about to buy these and the seller raised the priced over 20 raised the price twice in one daythese arent worth the money now If I have to spend that much then I will buy a better qaulity brand for just a few bucks more 
This set will last MANY years if taken care of properly We will look stylish around the camp fire with this set The construction and material of this product is well madeits a Colemanwhat more do I need to say 
It is a little bigger in size but we loved it Easy to put together Daughter loved to sitplay in it 
Beautiful set Easy to wash 
Very thin material and so cheaply made of thin metal material that you can merely fling your finger on any piece to hear a fair tong tone The rims of each piece are hollow underneath and its true that the enamel paint is not sprayed on well as other reviewers have pointed out its not uniform at all However this is a good set if you really just need some dishes for camping that are enamel painted for nostalgia but dont necessarily care that it lasts year after year the dishes themselves may as I could see myself playing frisbee with the plates but the paint coating will probably come off within a couple uses The silverware handles are cheap plastic although surprisingly have a bit of weight to them and have silver knots in them for looks although it feels just like fake plastic painted as silver to me Bottom line take it as you will as these are very thin pieces of metal cheaply bent into nostalgic shapes and spray painted an enamel glaze while still bearing a surprisingly fair amount of weight for what they are yet all at a reasonable price 
This stoneware set is outstanding The set is exactly what is advertised it has 4 heavy duty stoneware plates that are as pictured in the bright red color not like your run of the mill every day blue or black that everyone else has so this set stands out nicely It also comes with 4 coffee cups and 4 bowls which are also the beautiful bright red stoneware color This set is awesome at least to me I immediately pulled this out of the box when it arrived and it did not disappoint at all The set also comes with all your silverware 4 knives 4 forks and 4 spoons all in a nice little pouch that rolls up and stows away in your canteen box very nicely I have already used the set a couple of times and they are as durable as camping gear comes and are exactly what you would expect from any and all Coleman products that you would buy I am definitely looking forward to the many many years of great use that I am going to get out of this complete stoneware camping set for sure 
We have a family of 4 so this set was perfect for us on our national park camping trips We didnt want to keep wasting paper and plastic products I would give this a 5 star rating but the plates and some cups came chipped with the enamel already wearing off We contacted amazon and they sent a replacement fast The replacement arrived today and the same issue on some of the plates and bowls this time The plates this time also came with a thick drip like gobs on the tops of 2 plates They stick up about a quarter of an inch and run about 4 inches around on the plates Im thinking these are just going to be something that will always have an issue and over time need to be replaced Our last set was many years old the enamel wore off after years of use and being banged around eventually started to rust Thats my concern with these ones and why I wanted them replaced right away The silverware in this set is wonderful though They come with a carry case for them and each have their own place in that case The knives were great and even cut through grilled steaks with ease very impressed for what seemed like a butter knive I have to say though for coleman I was not too impressed with their quality it seems to be lacking from what I remember about the brand I was shocked to turn over each plate bowl and cup and see a sticker that said China ok the back I had assumed that coleman was still a product made in the USA I was sadly mistaken I looked up coleman to see what had happened to the quality of the products and this is what I believe has happened The Coleman Companys headquarters are in Wichita and it also has facilities in Texas There are approximately 3600 employees but most are not manufacturing jobs1 The majority of their goods are now manufactured in China  This came from wikipedia 
It was helpful and did not regret the purchase 
great kit we bought it to replace the stakes that come with the tent witch are way to small These larger stakes work great and when you use the pull item out of the ground 
Initially very disappointed as both arrived and would not function Bulbs were checked in known working unitsso the lanterns were defective as both bulbs were good They were returned postpaid and replaced and the two replacements worked perfectly Amazon provides excellent service to the customer 
worth every  must have and works great its little hard to pack but works great 
This is a very high quality pad Solid and durable It is NOT as comfortable as it appears in the image I wish it was thicker I will probably need to buy something else to use with it It does fit a camp cot very well 
A great buy Very handy to have around 
As usual Coleman has made a great addition to our camping and fishing gear Love it 
It doesnt seem as bright as what I remember my last lantern was and the case is absolute garbage If you make the mistake of trying to carry the lantern in the carrying case it will just fall out and the glove will break Utter junk The lantern itself is good if you remember not to use the carrying case  
Great lamp Especially for the price 
I also have the older model of this The key feature I like on this new one is the ability to adjust the output I havent yet decided whether to buy the new one for the adjustment feature as the old one works great But I am about to set out on a 30 day winter camping trip and the ability to run it at a much lower rate is tempting We originally got the old one to use in a boat for winter overnights in our MacGregor 26X It was so WONDERFUL It took a wouldbe miserable situation of being cold and dark in early evening at anchor and wanting to play a game rather than trying to read or sleep through a bunch more winter hours This warmed the cabin of our little sailboat up in about 20 mins to where you could take off mittens to hold cards We would then let the heater run for about an hour get it fairly toasty then turn it off and head off to bed and reading in the sleeping bag only after it got to cold to hold cards again If I didnt aready have an older model that works perfectly I would buy one of these instantly And guys if you want your gals to do more camping and be happier doing it get her one of these 
I have the older version of this heater without the auto lighting feature Ive used this heater for about five years and cant say anything bad about it Originally I bought it for tent camping in a small tent During a cool rainy spell we stayed in the tent and were as snug as a bug in a rug We being myself and my cocker spaniel I then went up to a popup camper and used it there as well and was pleased with the heat it put out for such a small heater This winter Ive been using it in my small computer room and it has really warmed up the area if I keep the door closed except for about 6 inches I would recommend this heater to anyone Dont expect it to heat a large room or large tent But for the price and the operating cost you cant beat it I also recently ordered an adapter that allows you to refill the 1 lb bottles from a 20 lb tank You cant refill them indefinitely but 34 times which will save a bunch of money and you put less of these bottles into the landfill If there was a 10star rating I would give this a 10 
I took this heater camping in Delaware on Columbus Day weekend October I used it in a wellventilated 4person mediumsized tent The first 2 days were cold and rainy and I was VERY glad to have brought it Now this heater is not going to make your tent into a sauna on a very cold day so dont expect to get in the tent and lounge in your skivies like you might do at home But after burning for about 1015 min it should raise the temperature in your tent several precious degrees making it bareable even comfortable For instance it did keep me from having to wear my heavy coat while inside the tent which pleased me Since it would certainly heat a smaller lessvented tent better than a larger morevented tent your results may vary As for me the results were not dramatic but certainly noticable and well worth the money spent Note This kind of catalytic heater requires those mini propane tanks It works by a chemical reaction between a meshy platinum filter and the burning propane gas so while theres no obvious propane smell and no open flame theres still a very hot surface that could catch objects on fire if they are placed directly in front of it for too long FYI when you first light it you may indeed see an igniting flame but that is just upon start up Once the starting flame vanishes put your hand gently over the heater  if you feel it eminating warmth youll know youve started it successfully Warning Just as the instructions warn you I do NOT recommend leaving this heater on through the night when you and your family are asleep It is both a breathing hazard and an obvious fire hazard But warning stated I did just that and I didnt have a problem I slept very comfortably on a couple cold nights and I didnt die in my sleep Again your results may vary However I should note that my own tent is extreamly well ventilated with the entire ceiling being mesh under the rain fly In addition the night was windy and I could actually feel a breeze of air circulating in my tent In truth if I had brought a lessventilated coldweather tent with me that weekend the heater may not have been needed at night but since I was stuck with a drafty tent I took the calculated risk that this would also lessen the threat In addition I took every possible precaution to ensure that nothing was near the heater before going to sleep Even so its a risk that I could not blame anyone for not wanting to take Also if you do this expect the propane tank to be empty by morning All in all other than the obvious handlewithcare factors I could not find a downside to this product In fact I could not imagine coldweather camping without it PS They also sell a slightly cheaper version which is the same in every way except it does not have the selfstarting switch and you start it manually with a lit match 
Like a lot of people on here have said its pretty easy to put together The kids love it 
Oh this thing is awesomesauce Bought it for a trip to Newport Beach CA and it was easy to set up 2 people even on a windy day This is a fantastic deal for the price 
Perfect picnic or camping dinnerware this is exactly what I needed and it is sturdy so I expect it will last for years Ill update if that is not the case  
perfect for camping 
This is everything a couple or a small family that doesnt mind washing dishes alot needs while camping The dishes were not as high quality as we were hoping This is something that I have noticed overall with Coleman the more popular they become the more the quality goes down The flaws that I noticed were gaps in the glaze which shouldnt be a problem if the dishes are dried well and without delay However we couldnt beat the price and the dish set should last a couple years 
very convenient Stakes are strong and the broomdust pan really comes in handy 
Beginner campers here  we use this plus bought more big stakes the hammer and puller came in handy as did thesmall broom Ready for our next camping trip 
nice kit compact an nice carry bag for keeping everything togetherwill work nicely for cleaning the Hemlock needles out of the inside of the tent 
The mallet is too soft and the stake removal tool bent on the first attempt Just get a little broom from the dollar store and buy the stakes you need elsewhere 
I have used this kit for several weekends The broom is useful for cleaning the tent before packing it back up 
I love it It Looks like it is still made very sturdy 
Pumps up easy lights well and throws light a good distance No complaints other than I wish I had a way to drain the unused fuel out and back into the can 
Great easy to use and comes with a funnel Way cheaper than any store near me 
Its a COLEMAN It does its job and does it well Now about the case people are complaining about the cheap locking taps with good reason There is a cheap and easy fix get a 30 rubber bungee  measure the rubber not the hooks rap it around the case and hook PROBLEM SOLVED 
Excellent 
Best of the best of the best for the investment Will last eternally and throws enough lightheat to play cardsgamesoutdoor cook indefinitely Just buy gas and spare mantles 
reminds me of camping with my father and family when I was younger always love the sound of pressure gas lantern added to the sounds of the ocean on the beaches at night 
Great shade at beach and sturdy one person set up in less than 7 minutes break down same amount of time Insert long pole first then 2nd and 3rd We were surprise that it fit easily back in provided bag most tents do not We will be using often 
I have the 14 thick pad before I bought this one and I know how good they are I will be using the camp pad quite a bit since I am a boy scout leader and we camp 11 months out of the year I rated it 5 stars because I know how good they are 
Weve recently converted a van for camping and built in lengthwise combination bench seatsbeds in the backthe listed size of these was perfect for them and the specspricing attractive so in spite of reading some negative reviews we decided to give them a try We did as the instructions said and let them fluff for over 30 hours before the triphmmm not nearly up to the 25 claimed so we put them in the van and made the 8 hour drive to our first campsitestill not close to the advertised thickness so we added lots air by mouth put them on top of our old thermarests for extra padding and headed to bed The mats quickly proved impossible to stay onthe fabric is so slick that not only did the sleeping bags quickly slide off but the mats also slid off the extra pads we had underneathfortunately  the mats started loosing air quickly and as they did they stayed in place betterstrange to think of a mat loosing air as a benefit but it was  These were a focusconstant concern during the 5 nights we camped and were returned quickly and easilythank you Amazon on our return Its too bad they didnt workguess well have to bite the bullet and go back to the higher priced and reliable matts 
I enjoy my pad I use it in conjunction with a thermorest closed cell pad Im a backpacker and haul all of this in too I use both for the combined comfort and most importantly the R value Most of my backpacking is done in the winter months so I prefer all of the insulation I can get If you use an external frame pack lashing all of this on isnt a problem Just remember if it hasnt been used in some time to allow it to inflate for 24hrs before your trip A few puffs of air after self inflation does well also just a few do not over inflate For the price ya cant beat it 
I bought this as an afterthought  as in Oh yeah I need one of those too Almost forgot Since it was a fast purchase I didnt research figuring Coleman to be good regardless WRONG 1 Not selfinflating as I think of selfinflating There is a thin foam pad that compresses when the mat is rolled up and it expands again letting in a bit of air when the valve is open 2 It is ALSO selfDEflating I learned this while camping There are no holes in it I figure the valve must be faulty I woke up with only that thin foam insert between me and the ground My body weight forced the air out 3 The pillow is good I like the pillow I would not recommend this to even an enemy Im going to a closedcell foam pad and if I can find the receipt its definitely going back Im very unhappy with Coleman Josh 
Received this Coleman lantern as a Christmas gift and I have really been enjoying it First it puts out quite a lot of light Recently we lost power and this lantern served as a mini reading lamp on my coffee table It came in so handy so that I could see well enough move around the room and even read a small book This lantern has mostly been used for power outages and once as a mini trip kind of like a camping trip Love everything about this lantern but one thing EIGHT D Batteries However the light does last a long time and I have yet to change the batteries as it is still going strong 
Worked great the first couple times then started having seating problems with the battery pack Then didnt want to unscrew and now just sits there because I cant get anyone or anything to get it unscrewed so I can replace the batteries which may or may not be used up 
Nice carrying case easy to wash and seems to be holding up well 
Just what I ordered Cant wait to use it 
Nice set for the price 
Great little set to grab and go for my husband and our 2 cub scouts 
First of all the price listed here is incorrect These retail at most sporting goods stores for between 80100 The optional piezoelectric starter is not needed if you simply keep a lighter handy Ive used one of these while motorcycle camping for a couple years and it really works well It produces enough heat to raise the temperature of my 3season 4man tent about 25 degrees when it dips below 30 outside even with two screen walls That makes the difference between being really comfy and sleeping well or being restless and waking throughout the night The heater will operate at full power for 10 hours on one propane cartridge Ive run it that long so you dont have to worry about it running out of fuel at 400 AM It operates silently but the heating surface does get very hot It will instantly meltchar nylon or other fabrics so you have to very carefully place this thing away from tent walls sleeping bags inflatables pets and clothes It also needs good ventilation as it consumes a lot of oxygen Respect it and be smart and youll be safe and warm all night Coleman understandably recommends not sleeping with it operating but thats why we buy these things I highly recommend that you test run it for a couple hours before using it in an enclosed space When new it can produce a disagreeable odor kinda like burnt metal and paint After being broken in  its fine The plastic body which surrounds the heater is bulky The earlier version of this with a simple wire prop stand was much more compact Still if you have the space its a great investment Its said tents keep you dry  sleeping bags keep you warm which is true but a little gem like this will put a smile on your face when the temperature drops below 40 degrees 
Perfect for warming up in the deer blind or for those cold spring and fall camping nights 
Been using it for a couple of years now and works good Puts out decent amount of heat for Colorado nights There are several issues with this product Lighting can be a bit unclear when it is actually lit pending on the lighting conditions to be able to see the mesh faintly glow indicating it is lit But it does light fairly easy and convenient with the builtin switch One of the legs fractured a bit from rotating it  although some user error to blame there wish it was more durable it still stands up ok though This product does NOT have tip over protection where it will shut off upon tipping over Although it has legs and a tripod stance it could tip over pretty easily on a tent floor on rough ground or just being knocked from accidental impact There is no low oxygen sensor or shut off protection from low oxygen The Coleman website specifically states to use in well ventilated area and do not use while sleeping Im assuming for several safety reasons including possibility of tipping it over But I bought this item to use at night while camping since that is when it gets cold mostly I would recommend looking at the Mr Heater one as well for around the same price which looks sturdier and has safety features builtin and is approved for indoor use httpwwwamazoncomMrHeaterF2151003800BTUIndoorSafedpB001CFRF7Irefsr12ieUTF8qid1407387059sr82keywordsmrheater httpwwwamazoncomMrHeaterF232000IndoorSafePortabledpB002G51BZUrefsr11shomegardenieUTF8qid1406819767sr11keywordsmrheaterbuddyportableheater As far as other safety issues there are concerns of carbon monoxide poisoning with any device like this but rvroadtrips websitie explains the safety an risks involved with catalytic heaters Which from what I have read catalytic heaters do not burn with an open flame and this reduces the amount of carbon monoxide and other toxic fumes emitted compared to an open flame heater BUT it is NOT the existence of carbon monoxide or toxic fumes which is the danger when using a heater like this indoors it is the potential for the LACK of oxygen since this also consumes oxygen So still having a well ventilated space to allow for oxygen to flow into your space is still a must safety info here httprvroadtripsthefuntimesguidecom201202catalyticheatersphp 
First and forever there was the cold And then Coleman saidLet there be heatAnd so it was The people didnt know they were nakedbecause they were warm Rescued by a Black Cat 
I bought this as a way to take the chill off inside of our tent but Im scared to use it because of all the warnings 
I got cold after a few hours in my boat on Puget Sound now this heater keeps me warm even in bad weather great product and will recommend to anyone who needs heat on the area around them 
good money spent well designed and compact and the quality is acceptable and tuff enough to use and not fall appart 
What can I say This is a great item to buy to help you when setting up your tent I think everyone should have this tent kit if you want to be sure you have everything you need to set up your tent 
My tent came with plastic tent stakes so its not good to use under some environments Coleman tent kit provides best solution for it with reasonable price However the steel tent stake isnt pure steel the plastic header is way easy broken when you try to pull it out from the ground I purchased 2 more sets of Coleman 10Inch Steel Tent Stakes to have total 12 stakes However 5 of 12 plastic stakes were broken via 3 times camping Good set with reasonable price and it will be great if they can change the plastic part to metal one 
Got this at Walmart when I was in a bind The first time I used it it popped and lost all its air pressure I did inflate it by mouth a bit but I also only weigh 185 I will return tomorrowwith a sore back 
First I should probably note that the version of this pad that I bought at a brickandmortar store is labeled Coleman Max so it may not be exactly the same thing  but it looks pretty much the same Its the same color as the darker one in the closeup of the valve and the valve is identical I actually paid about ten dollars less than Amazons posted price at the time of this review Im a bony guy and really wanted something with a little more loft than my Thermarest SOLite pad which is a little on the large side when rolled anyway even though I bought the short version for bike camping trips It had to be reasonably light and packable and I figured Id give this a shot since I could return it if it didnt work My expectations I admit were not actually very high Ive been disappointed by many sleeping pads in the past and would actually have just purchased one of those small floatationdevice style air mattresses if my hubby had not firmly suggested that one of these might offer better insulation and so forth I was willing to give it a try but still worried that my boniness and sidesleeping tendencies could be problematic In practice this pad significantly exceeded my expectations That said theres a bit of a process involved in getting it to work right A PreInflate As the manufacturer suggests before your first camping trip unroll it open the valve and let it sit for as long as possible  twentyfour hours if you can I bought mine the day before my trip so I had to make due with sixish Then deflate it roll it close the valve and pack it B Dont Wait Til Youre Ready for Bed When you make camp set your tent up unroll your pad open the valve immediately and let it do its thing Of note we rolled into camp on our second night only a couple hours before bed I set up my tent and pad right away and it was fine C Give It An Assist Perhaps most importantly  give the pad several good puffs by mouth this by the way has been recommended for every single selfinflating pad Ive considered  including much more expensive models  The style of the valve makes this a bit challenging but youll get the hang of it quickly Youll want to give it a little more air than you think you need because it will lose a little as youre screwing the valve shut Some users find the tufted design of this pad uncomfortable I on the other hand feel that the tufted design is exactly what makes it so very comfortable for someone like me Where a nontufted pad might be compressed flat at my bony points the tufted billows in this pad offer support and relief On its first night out I shoved it into my sleeping bag and slept better than I sleep at home Thats not hyperbole by the way  I really mean it I slept better than I normally do at home even after a comparablychallenging day on the bike There are pads in the world that pack smaller and there are probably better pads  and if I were backpacking instead of traveling by bicycle I might want one of those However for less than fifty bucks a little finagling makes this pad work just fine Pros Tufted design works well for bony people Holds air once inflated Deflates easily and packs reasonably small for the price Builtin compression straps are great For its price point offers exceptional comfort Attached pillow can be inflated by mouth or left uninflated Your choice Cons Some users dont enjoy the tufted design Not entirely selfinflating Inflates a tad slowly Not ideal for backpackers doesnt pack small enough 
Large and fairly easy to set up once you read the instructions this shade structure is great to keep you safe from the sun The tent collapses into a storage bag that will easily fit in your car  its smaller than a collapsible chair 
Its much brighter than what i expected and no longer have to worry about blackouts It uses a lot of batteries though 
great for camping 
Great set of dinnerware We used it while camping and although we only have a family of three it was really nice to have the fourth set so if when my son ended up dropping something we had a back up for it Live the carrying case for the silverware so we didnt have silverware just sliding around everywhere 
Not for kitchen 
The plates and cups are good solid quality the knives forls and spoons are cheap quality and bend easily This was the first bad product I ever bought from Coleman I kept it for the metal plates cups and salad bowls 
We have a set of Coleman enamel dinnerware from almost ten years ago We now have three more children who are just now old enough for a real camping trip all at once and we needed more dishes My wife ordered these when they were on sale so she figured that for 20 they couldnt be as bad as some of the reviews were saying Unfortunately they are pretty awful There are clear bubbles and defects that you can readily see The metal isnt entirely covered and will likely need to be treated to stop the dishes from rusting further than they already appear to be around the edges Im not sure if we are going to keep these or not It mostly depends on whether we can find a better substitute By comparison our original dishes look brand new next to these No rusting not flaking no flaws Im really disappointed in this brand that Ive trusted for years with so many different camping products 
What can you say about a great lantern exceptexcellent lantern all be it too expensive guess everything is going that wayupand up nice lantern good secure carry case thanks for a great product Coleman Thanks for the good service Amazon CC46 
The lantern works but I couldnt get the full light output because the included mantles burnt holes thru the sides Instead of lighting on fire and shriveling up the flame burnt from the bottom up the side and burnt holes in the mantle The box it came looked used and had clearly been opened at least once There are scuff marks on the bottom of the case and I found burnt marks on the top of the reflector I dont mind buying used stuff but I like to know when I do 
A workhorse of a light I much prefer the liquid fueled type vs the bottled propane 
Delivered as promised All parts were included Components seem to be made of sturdy material but have not had opportunity to use in the great outdoors Will be able to offer a fair evaluation later this summer 
I am not a girly girl however somethings I dont do For example I have never put up a tent and I do not know how to use a circular saw I do use a belt sander and have built a table and cabinets So when I say this made putting up and taking my tent down easy I want you to know it made it EASY My cousin who camps all the time was also impressed WE both just went wow did that just happen that easily He said you know you always need one of these and you never have it for both the hammer and the thing that pulls the anchors back out The anchors did not have the green things on them but it didnt matter the little green squiggly thing slips under the anchor and just pull and out it comes 
Nice kit to have for utility and back ups The stake tool doesnt seem quite strong enough though Everything else is fine 
Used this kit to replace the stock tent spikes that normally come with a new tent The stakes were able to drive through stoney ground and provide a good anchor There were several wind gust during our camp trip where other tents toppled in our area the stakes worked great 
This is great for a new camper I never even thought about this till it came up in other things I might like when I started buying camping gear This will surly make putting up the tent a lot easier then a metal hammer and I can sweep out the bottom of the tent if the kids make a mess 
I downgraded a star because the stakes get caught in the mesh bag Otherwise its fine for the price Put up the portapottie tent and staked it down so no unexpected privacy issues 
Heats up very hot Do not use very close at all to anything flammable The heat rises UP So make sure it is not next to a tent wall in a dome tent It WILL melt it The face and ring get extremely hot I already have a couple bad burns from playing around with it and accidentally touching the thing 2nd degree burns That is my fault though Just make sure LOTS of room around it I would not recommend using around a kid or dog Does what it is supposed to do though 
Weve only tried it once but seem to have problems starting it up Not sure if its lit and dont want propane escaping 
Ive used this thing about a dozen times and it seems to go through a tank of gas after about six hours Like others mentioned it smells at first so make sure to turn it on outside and let it burn through half a can of gas to get the stink out of it Overall Im very pleased but be warned the little arms tend to slowly collapse and then the burner will end up on the floor potentially melting your floor and causing a fire if youre not careful Ive tried to tighten them up a bit but for now Ill just keep a close eye on it 
Really like my Coleman BlackCat Heater Ive used it camping and also just sitting outside on a cool evening Great for the golf cart also 
This is not an easy set up and really sucks for Hawaii because of the consistent wind I thought it would be a popup type sunshade but it took about 15 min to set it up Think of it like setting up a tent with 4 different inconvenient tent poles The wind blew it away on the beach about three times so I took it down Packed into a normal suitcase like a champ though Good quality Great for inside your house to pretend you are camping 
Seems decent glad I didnt pay more then I did for it 
Good one of the cups was wrecked from getting beat around in transport I am in the Army and use this in my barracks Works great for that application Would probably serve a college student or a new camper well Just make sure you give it a good wash when you first get it 
As other reviewers have stated dishes have serious paint chips or paint glops No quality control with this product Returned 
Weve used one of these lanterns for years taking it out every time we experience a power failure Despite being in storage most of the time it never fails to work when put to use The light output is exceptional and weve found that the batteries last even longer than stated I wouldnt want to be without one of these during a power outage 
I am so happy I got this I was camping out on 30 nights it was cold I turned this on an hour before I got into the tent and you could feel at least a 10 difference it was still a little chilly but made sleeping much more comfortable I highly recommend this product Well worth the money and then some 
I like this heater has a high and low seeing and it fires heat at an angle instead of straight up It keeps my 2 man blind much warmer 
I bought this for my camping trip but did not use itit was way too bulky tho I did not have the chance to use it 
Works great in a closed in tent or similar space actually heated my garage pretty well when I was testing it out Doesnt work as well if the top of your tent is a open they rain fly didnt do enough to trap the heat in 
I got this kit for the mallet and spare tent stakes The mallet has a good weight and the tent stakes are much sturdier than I had figured The little handbroom and stake puller may come in handy Recommended Yes worth the price for a couple of the items The other items are a bonus 
I agree with a review by Niamiah per the case The case used by Coleman on this lantern is very similar to a model I purchased 20 years ago If the user lockssecures in other words snap the tabs of the cover under the tabs on the base there will be no problem with the bottom falling out Remember as with anything if youre doing it wrong bad things will happen Trust me I have plenty of experience in that department Also the brightness of this lantern is plenty at full Im a big fan of 100 watt light bulbs  and the light output of this lamp totally satisfies my needs when camping or reading during power outages Quite often I turn it down a bit No one can can wrong with this tried and true designed lantern 
awesome great buy havent had any problems w the holding case as others have stated 
Unit seems to work very well I had the 1000 BTU version before and that model just didnt put out enough heat other than to warm your hands Granted we were camping in 9 degree weather This 3000 BTU unit puts out a very noticeable amount of heat I have yet to try it again in 9 degree weather but we used it outside one cold night sitting around a table just to see how well it worked and 4 of us noticed the heat I think this unit will work extremely well inside a tent While supposedly safe in a tent I am still a little nervous about carbon monoxide I tested the unit inside my house with a home CO detector sitting a foot away I left it running for 2030 mins and the alarm never went off That reassured me a bit I think we may make a habit of taking the detector with us when we plan to use this inside a tent Better safe than sorry  The only thing that kept me from giving it a fifth star was the electronic ignition was kinda hit and miss I would recommend always having matches or a lighter as a backup but thats just smart to do anyway when youre camping 
Took this heater camping  it got down to 35 heater worked great in a short time Was in a 4 person tent 
Great product great price and fast shipping 
This is great It has everything I need to go camping Its good everything is in one bag then to be scattered 
I bought this for our recent purchase of a Coleman Red Canyon 8person tent At first I thought the tent stakes would be a smart enough addition but then I saw this kit with a mini hand broom and dust pan that is pretty smart if youve ever been camping the rubber mallet smaller than you think but still hand size and a uniquely designed stake puller Very simple in construction but structurally sound in its function Comes in a simple storage bag to keep in or attached to your tent kit Though I wish perhaps some seam sealer or sealing tape came with this I wont use that as a criterion to knock the score down Maybe if the bag came with a mini aluminum carabiner to attach to whatever Hint hint to Coleman for your next product revision 
This kit has come in very handy I love the little dustpan and broom We have two lab mixes that shed a lot and track dirt into the tent so if has been very useful Also the extra stakes and mallet have been very useful as well They are more heavy duty than the ones that came with our tent 
looks good Ill try it out this spring I dont see any problems with this the silverware looks a little cheap but for the price I am not complaining and I guarantee Ill be missing a fork or a spoon or a knife after the first trip Just a fact of life 
Basic camping gear 
Incredible Even after reading descriptions and seeing pictures I never expected to be as big as it is Its huge Extremely easy to set up and great quality 
This product was as described and was easy to set up I purchased the green one mainly because I liked the color better than the others that were offered but also because the other colors were more expensive for some reason Greenery is the 2017 Pantone color of the year so you would think the green would be more on trend  expensive but its not The cabana is well made and we did find any problems with the seams or stitching It only took five minutes or so to set it up with two people working on it it was mostly set up by one though really I liked that it offers a opaque closedopenor mesh zippered door as well as a larger opaque zippered door on the opposite side It is also larger than other cabanas of this sort and we were able to seat three people inside comfortably Because it closes on both sides it can also be used for privacy or as a changing room at the beach It is important to note though that it is not tall enough for most teensadults to stand up in so while it is not ideal for a changing room it is still nice to have it as an option It also came with sand bags and although they were not necessary for the tentcabana they were handy as well since we used them to weigh down the corners of our beach blanket which we spread out in front of the open door 
When I received this the check valve was already stuck in the open position making it very hard to build pressure 
Upsides It works Downsides The InstaStart thingy doesnt No matter how many times I press the button I see the little spark but apparently not enough propane is in the vicinity of that spark to fire it off I use a longsnout butane barbecue lighter to light the thing without being barbecued Its not very adjustable Theres low heat Theres high heat Thats it The metal grill on the front gets very hot You must be very careful where you place this thing so that said grill doesnt contact you your tent your dog your upholstery in the small van youre trying to heat up or anything else flammable Youd think they could at least put some sort of flared guard or bumpers around the front to help keep stuff from coming in contact with that metal grill sort of like the bumpers on chicken house heaters to keep their metal grill from contacting stuff if the heater is knocked over but apparently thatd require too much thought Theres only one safe way to place this heater  on its side with the legs extended as shown in the product photo You cant stand it up like a candle it might fall over and then that metal ring around the front which gets very hot would contact something that you probably dont want contacted This doesnt put out much heat on high heat but still drains a 1 pound can of propane within four hours No problem you say youll just hook it up to the 20 pound tank for your barbecue and have plenty of heat for all night camping for a week Uhm no a there is no way to hook a 20 pound tank to this heater and b if you did rig up a hose of some sort see the part about only one safe way to place this heater  by removing the rear leg the 1 pound canister the heater is now in an attitude that is unsafe Coleman says dont do it and theyre right  this heater simply is designed wrong to be safe when used with an external propane tank Theres no safety cutoff to turn off the heater if it gets bumped and falls over from the pictured attitude which as I noted is the only safe attitude So dont leave the heater alone with a dog or large cat that might bump into it and make it fall over or you might come back to a smoldering tent and barbecued FidoFluffy All in all this heater works but its profoundly mediocre Ive used it in my garage to supplement an electric heater that struggles with cooler temperatures but due to its limitations never used it for camping as originally intended and probably wont ever do so In particular the very hot grill on the front is such a safety hazard that I refuse to use it anywhere but on the concrete floor of my garage where if it falls over all thatll happen is that it contacts nonflammable concrete Im now researching better options for a tent heater because this just isnt acceptable to me Youd have to haul along a metal roasting pan and a piece of fiberglass insulation to make this safe to use in a tent the pan to hold the heater the fiberglass insulator to go under the pan to insulate it from the tent floor and at that point youre into a realm of clunkiness that makes me say eh time to do something else 
I bought this to preheat my old drafty Jeep on cold winter mornings In 510 min all the frost is melted and windows are clear and its a nice warm 70 degrees inside I built a support stand that works great No real small like other posters Perhaps they changed their Catalytic material 
Bought this item for frequent camping trips Recently used it in Yosemite for 3 nights and was very glad to have it If there was 4 12 stars I would have selected it The difference between the outside temp and the inside temp was quite noticeable maybe in the 710 degree range just a guess though There is a small flame when you light it but its really just a minor arc on the face of the item It does smell but to be honest so did the kids and I and both were bearable Lit it in the tent changed the canister in the tent relit it in the tent no problems and no worries Only thing that would have been nice to have was a small fan to help circulate the heat a little as the heat tends to go straight up All and all I would definitely purchase this again 
This is an easy yes for the price Got it to use for the beaches on a Caribbean cruise It was small enough and light enough to fit in a checked bag Setup takes a while lots of stakes and three poles that are quite difficult to get through the material but it is worth it It blocks the sun well resists the wind when set up properly and is comfortable to sit in No laying out in the sand We only got to use it once since most of the beaches had free umbrellas and such but I still feel like I got my moneys worth Plus it is still in perfect shape and feels like it will last for years to come 
Some chips in the enamel when delivered mostly alright 
Great for my camper 
great for throwing a couple of these sets in the pack and kayaking for a few hours to have lunch 
The plates I received included one with quite a lot of deformities Their QC checkers mustve been going to the potty when mine rolled down the line 
The standard tent stakes are weak and dont dig in well The actual nail part of the stakes are great though the pull tool for removal bends very easily and the holes in the stakes can break if youre not careful They can be removed without destroying them but you have to be pretty specific about how you go about it Also there are only 4 stakes Most of the bigger tents have 6 or 8 ties so look for a set with more stakes if youre not buying a small tent 
This kit was very helpful when setting up our tent The mallet and larger steaks were especially handy We bought the Coleman Sundome 6Person Tent Green 10Feet x 10Feet 
great price fast shipment nothing but good things to say highly recommend item is as described I had no trouble getting the stuff in the mesh bag with room to spare 
Daughter loved the kit It has everything she has missed during past camping trips and she plans to show it off to friends 
This will be a nice addition to my camping equipment The stakes are better than the ones that come with your tent Price was right also 
Coleman lantern  the only thing I miss is the cap used to be secured to the tank on the old ones  not on this version  no big deal  still the same reliable product 
Olds school lamps rule Not for sissies or noobs to camping Love the warm light compared to the sterile LED craze No batteries needed 
I love it 
I like the duel fuel idea Although I think Ill stick to Coleman fuel 
I grew up with Coleman pressure lanterns as the child of missionaries in the South Pacific 3rd World For years Coleman pressure lanterns and a few hurricane lanterns lit our nights on the other side of the world These days as outdoor lovers  and prepping for emergency power outages short or longterm  we decided to add a couple of these lanterns to our equipment We love the fact that theres been a breakthrough in fuel supply These also readily burn regular car gasoline and that makes them extra useful and certainly worth a few more bucks What you save on gasoline by the gallon alone is worth the money yesterday the price of a gallon of white gas at my hardware store was 13 In general with all our equipment we burn gasoline that is treated withnbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefSeaFoamSF16MotorTreatment16ozdpB0002JN2EUrefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTF8Sea Foam SF16 Motor Treatment  16 oza This is so much better than the competitors gasoline treatmentforstorage products and keeps all your gasoline engines starting and running better It came to us recommended by a highly experienced small engine mechanic and our engine headaches largely disappeared after that We use it regularly in all our equipment truck and car Treated gas burns great in this lantern and I can even leave fuel in the tank ready to go in an emergency We bought this with another great blast from the past  thenbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefColemanGuideSeriesPowerhouseTMDualFuelTMStovedpB00006I56JrefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTF8Coleman Guide Series PowerhouseTM Dual FuelTM Stovea Its another classic now improved by being able to burn gasoline as well This lanterns comes in a strong hard shell which makes taking it camping extraeasy You dont want to break the glass or shatter the mantles We have seen the light Strongly Recommended 
It gets quite hot and fast nice little heater I preburned mine before setting out but it does have a tiny bit of smell to it It is a lifesaver when it gets cold especially with these new tent designs with the screen tops and a thin fly Cold weather pours in This helps combat that The only issue we had is lighting it I resorted to a lighter and even then you were not sure when it lit Once lit it stayed hot for a long time 
This thing is easy to use and good for taking the chill off a tent before turning in I would have liked a way to keep it running on minimum through the night in our 9ft tent but with bodies all over the floor and no night stand theres nowhere safe to place it since it wont hang like the lanterns We used it a lot outdoors too just pointed at us which is a less smokey way of keeping warm than pressed against a fire The burnin is good advice and the electric starter is better than fussing with matches to light it Remember to bring spare cylinders as they do run out 
This unit is flameless definitely burning but spread over a large surface with lots of infrared heat and provides right about the same amount of heat as a normal electric heat While great for the obvious uses Id say it is a must if there is ever a chance youll lose electricity during the winter Ive had no issues what so ever and have had mine for five years Its warming me up right now as a supplemental heat source Edit I bought the smaller version the sportcat which is half the BTU and boy did that smell for hours But this one never had such an issue 
I used this for the first time at a Dog Agility Trial It was so cold inside that any kind of heat was welcomed I call this heater my pricey hand warmer I like the size ease of use and push button start but it projects a radiant heat You have to be on top of it to feel the warmth I have since bought another Mr HeaterBigBuddy It has a fan wseveral settings Thats the one I recommend 
For a beach traveler like me I highly recommend this product It is small enough to put in your checked luggage and not heavy at all Im from California with a family of 4 and we took this in our 30 checked bag to Puerto Rico no problems People were very curious where I got this and we got many compliments We also took this on our short trip to USVI where we got many more compliments because the people were nice there Easy to set up and small enough to travel with LOVE this little tent I bought it again when it went on sale 
great 

gift for my camper husbandhes had his eye on these for awhile great setsilverware seems flimsybut we were after the mugs and plates 
good buy 
Does the job good quality 
Good quality all you need for a roadside kit 
One the better quality sets The silverware is on the cheap side 
This is a review from a hunters perspective and rates the performance of the Coleman BlackCat EI Catalytic Heater heater according to the environment it is used in Why I purchased the heater  To use in my Primos Ground Max Eclipse Hunting Blind httpwwwamazoncomPrimosGB2500TheEclipseBlinddpB001P5G6TI which has the dimensions L x W x H 770 x 770 x 700 while deer hunting  Because I do not have adequate cold weather footwear I should buy some and my toes get too cold very easily  I hunt in Texas where the wind is always blowing and because so it can chill you quiet quickly even with our mildly cold winter weather  To have a portable heater for tailgating events and to play my guitar on my back porch in the winter wout freezing How stereotypically hick of me  How I used it in context to this review  I used it in my Primos Ground Max Eclipse Hunting Blind httpwwwamazoncomPrimosGB2500TheEclipseBlinddpB001P5G6TI which has the dimensions L x W x H 770 x 770 x 700 while hunting deer Pros  Heats well for the reasons I bought it I keep it right at my feet and it heats up my feet and legs warm which in turn keeps me warm all over Does not keep the hunting blind warmed up as I have the hunting windows open preventing any real heat build up in the blind  It is very simple to operate You turn the knob to high for about 3045 seconds so propane will feed out and then you press the electric striker to fire up the heater I have seen other portable propane heaters that need a match or that force you to prime the device for 1 minute then you strike and hold the knob in a pilot light ignition position for another minute then you reset the knob and turn on to the desired heat level That is too much trouble  The heater is very quiet An animal within 5 yards will likely not hear the sound The closest encounter I have had is a deer 20 yards away and it did not hear or smell the heater Even the strike of the ignition switch is not much louder then when I bump my rifle against my chair leg or my shooting stick  Works well on high and low settings I used it on both settings in 12F temperature where everything was covered in frost and with 15 mph wind blowing from the north Had no issues keeping my feet and in turn my body warm When my fingers got a little cold I just put my hands down between my legs to catch the rising heat and they warmed up nicely Cons  Has a very slight propane burning odor on high setting It was only noticeable when I bent down to warm my hands and the heater was on high I did not really notice it when the heater was on low or when I was sitting completely erect in my chair If you are hunting you should be upwind of your prey anyway making this slight odor a nonissue  Takes 3045 seconds to start up I would stop the heater after I would warm up and then start it up again later when I was getting chilled I would become impatient waiting the 3045 seconds and click the starter a few times making noise and taking my attention away from hunting etc This is basically a me problem and could be solved by just being more patient Concluding Statement I have not used the heater in a great deal of situations so I cannot give you any information on the life durability and exact efficiency of the heater All I know is that it works well for my hunting needs and I would buy another if I needed it I also think that it would keep my feet and legs warm even in an open tripod hunting stand or a tree stand For non hunters this would work fine for direct heat in a camping or emergency situation It would not effectively heat an uninsulated space larger than the dimensions of my blind I hope this information is helpful  
I purchased this to use during tailgating Tried it out for 12 hour or so and was not satisfied Very little heat produced Could only feel a difference if within a few inches of the heater Would probably work just fine in an enclosed area but not out in the open Will need to look for something else or just deal with the cold  Item was returned 
tent pegs and broom and dust pan in a bag what is there to say lol a b c d 
I really like the product BUT it only has 4 tent spikes and that is not enough for any reasonable sized tent I was hoping for an available kit that offered a sufficient amount of spikes since that is the reason for buying the kit 
Great solid stakes that dont bend and break We used them camping in VT on rocky ground We always have trouble with stakes that bend but these were great 
This tent kit includes tent spikes that are much better than the ones included by default in the Coleman tent I purchased but they only include four spikes While I realize that that should be sufficient it can get rather windy while camping and I like to make sure everything is nice an secure Outside of that personal opinion the kit supplies exactly what it says and the spikes are very sturdy and long The included tool to pull them out of the ground works great and having the mallet included with the kit makes it all the easier 
included everything needed for a tent setup notebroom is not yellow like the picture its white little pouch is handy 
Burned for hours with great light in woods Could use a little brighter Next one I purchase will be the powerhouse 
dual fuel is the sht 
I had a problem being able to pump up the tank The pump itself seemed to stick as if in need of lubrication I could absolutely NOT remove the air pump and was NOT going to end up scratching the tank It appears to me that the pump tube itself is not inserted into the tank straight it is offset a bit and since I own other Coleman Lanterns I am unsure about this fact This Lantern is beyond cute Huge amount of light super compact size is the most comfortable plus carrying case I will talk to Coleman about this issue It really is a fine Lantern but you can tell the cheapness of the parts that are now being used Yes I own 6 other Coleman Lanterns that are decades old and yes I expect qualityColeman you can do a lot better and keeping with your tradition of providing superlative products but if you are hoping the young generations are going to be interested in your products as millions of us already arehave then clean it up and give us QUALITY I buy quality take great care of everything I own but I do not feel this product will last a decade Maybe thats what they want 
It was not as big as I thought it would be Obviously I should have thought about the dimensions but I sort of assumed all of these lanterns would be the same size It puts off plenty of light so this is probably fine On the other hand I could not get the lantern to shut off completely by turning the valve to off I put the valve in the off position and it continued to burn for 10 minutes To get it to go out completely I had to put the valve in the off position then vent the tank I wouldnt think it should work this way and I had some concerns about venting the tank so close to the lit mantles On the other hand I didnt want to go to bed with the lantern still burning Perhaps there is some operator error on my part The hard case is very cheaply made be VERY sure the bottom detent latches are engaged prior to picking it up or you will drop the lantern out the bottom 
Buy this  I love this set  
Good product for the money received in a timely manner 
fantastic set really perfect in evvery way 
little noisy 
Perfection 
I bought this to use in my hunting blind I didnt want anything overly large but was a little worried that it might not have enough heat The first time I tried it the outside temperature was 25 degrees F I set it up a couple of feet away and facing me After a few minutes I cranked it all the way down to its lowest setting I have to tell you after a full afternoon and evening of sitting out there I was warm as toast Im very pleased with this unit 
As I read from other reviews important to run it outside to bake off any mfg chemicals and get the smell out I took a cheapo propane can and ran it through Thing works as described nice unit 
Used it to heat our very big tent on Columbus Day weekend in Bar Harbor ME was very warming Was so cold however some mornings it didnt light right away because of the cold dew that got on in It did light though once the dew dried out 
Great item for camping in a larger tent  not recommended for small pup tents Would have preferred a steadier platform the heater can be knocked over if you are not careful Build quality is good have only had it a few weeks so I dont know about the longterm ruggedness 
Already have it set up in my living room Since its only 27 degrees F here I Cant wait to take it to the beach when the weather permits 
The inexpensive plastic handled flatware is the highest quality part of this set You read that right Inexpensive plastic handles arent high quality to begin with I found the same problems as many other reviewers have found with the enamel being chipped from the get go There is definitely a lack of quality in the production of these dishes I would not use a knife on these dishes at all I use them when camping and like the fact that these are lighter weight than corelle but wish I had gone for the red and white corelle dishes instead They will last longer than these 
I like the quality but I didnt know these were made in China Overall a good deal but I always worry about poisonous contaminants coming from Chines factory especially on materials I eat off 
Its a great Set cleans easily 
Do you know how many years I struggled through putting up my tent before discovering this great kit Makes life so much easier  
New or old Coleman lanterns they all work great Only down side I have found is more of a personal prefrance I like a bigger top being I use it for razor clam digging I have found the bigger top defects the light downwards better 
great 
Gas rocks 
i love my lantern duel fuel is the way to go make sure you secure under the bottom and over the top with a belt or some para cord if youre intending to carry it by the handle 
Just got one of these and its not all that great It is pretty bright at first but gets dim very quickly Ive used coleman lanterns for years and this is probably one of the worst as you have to keep pumping it up You get about 15 minutes of good light out of it then it starts to dim after about 25 minutes itll start flickering and after about 45 minutes itll get so dim that its unusable if you dont pump it up some more Put about 3040 pumps in it and repeat all night long It says you get 7 hours of run time on high but the adjustment range is so narrow that you dont get any more run time by turning it down on low These are nothing like the old 200A and 220 series lanterns that they used to make Also the mantles that it comes with arent very good About half the time they dont survive being burned in so make sure you have plenty of spares Peerless mantles are much better brighter and more durable if you can get them 
Great little lantern lit up the whole campsite Follow the instructions and it will work great Other reviews talk about the bottom of the case falling off its operator error There is a tiny tab under each button that says push As long as the lid snaps over that small tab its locked on Not just the push button but the small tab under the button You have to manually snap it over I only ran this on gasoline since it will be my primary Fuel It ignited and burned safety just like Colemans white gas Great lantern high quality 
Been using this for about 3 weeks now and it works very well I havent tried it with the unleaded gas yet but works real well with the Coleman fuel 

I bought this because we were going camping while it was still pretty cold outside When you get it you need to burn it to get rid of the initial fumes It lights easily and does project a warm area in front of the unit If the air is still you can use it outside If it is windy forget about it It is still not clear if it is recommended for use inside a tent while sleeping I found conflicting information We have a large 16X8 dome tent with an open mesh top covered by a fly so I felt like it would be OK to run inside Im still alive so it didnt kill me It did warm the tent but in reality the heat is going out the top of the tent It helped keep us warm during a very cold night We actually got some sleep everyone else in our group was groggy the next day because they were so cold I woke up at 2 am with a frozen face and replaced they empty cylinder then relit it There are heaters that burn outside the tent and warm inside but they are big and expensive My wife and kids liked the comfort Is it worth the cost of the unit and a few cylinders of gas to keep you warm at night For us the answer is yes in the right situation When its cold and you have kids or a frozen wife its worth its weight in gold The quality is decent not great so I give it 4 stars 
While outfitting for primitive winter camping I first opted for a 400W oilfilled electric heater w power control to be run off a battery backup pack at nightthis to preclude any COCO2fire hazard problems A backup pack big enough to do the 400Wer plus several other minor electrical things is not in my budget  SoI bought a BlackCat tried it out on some of our prematurely cold Central TX nights suck it GlobalWarmingWeenies and loved it  I loved it so much I just bought 2 more I dont do campfires for warmth or cooking so these BlackCats have a lot of work to do They seem up to the task But as I said watch where you put your fingers while moving it or you may get excessive warming where you least want itouch 
This heater is awesome It really keeps you warm when weather is around 30 degrees We borrowed one from a friend when we went camping at 11000 ft in Colorado We ended up having to buy our own one we liked it so much We were always die hard campers but when you throw kids into the mix we really wanted to make sure they stayed warm I highly recommend it 
The items seem a little cheap but work well enough I havent done extensive use with them but the stake puller was definitely handy after we tried our new tent in the back yard The dust pan and brush was handy for small bits of dirt but I would obviously suggest a full size broom of some sort to clean the entire tent All in all the items are no fuss do what theyre supposed to do and are lightweight small and compact which would be beneficial whether youre driving to your campsite or hiking to it 
I love the stakes the stake remover and the bag I wish the mallet was a little smaller though it unnecessarily weighs down my pack 
This is a pretty basic tent kit some strong stakes that youll need a few more of and a nice little dustpan and brush Good strong mallet too but the stake puller isnt great The plastic is coming off after just a few uses and it bends out if youre pulling a really stuck stake 
I have this with the rest of our camping gear and I love that it is small and can go anywhere 
LOVE IT 
Came with a smashed cup  the rest was ok so kept it 
The flatware is crap but the tableware is what I expected 
Works as advertised but its all about how you use it The bigger your space naturally the less effective this is In our experience youve really got to have this thing within 34 feet of you to feel it Again with a smaller tent more heat will likely be trapped 
Tested upon receipt The push button start worked like a charm No matches needed and puts plenty of heat out Would definitely buy it again if needed 
cant wait to use it 
I bought this lantern to save wear and tear on my lanterns from the sixties Not built like older onesbut gets the job done My biggest gripe is the new style mantelsdont hold up If you need a lantern buy itit works fine Buy extra mantels 
This light is not as well made as my old Coleman lantern but still is a nice lantern for the price Works well as designed 

Bought for emergencies Works great 
Quality product very fast shipping as well 
The coleman beach tent is a very well made product I have been using it several times at the beach now and I cant go without it The assembly is straightforward Its definitely easier with two people especially on a windy day however its manageable with one I can lay in it and be completely shaded from the sun and elements It withstands wind very well too 2 adults can fit inside comfortably Every time I use it someone asks where I got it Its practical use justifies the price ten fold and the green color is attractive The only thing I would comment negatively about is it is difficult to fold the tent back into the small bag it comes in 
Nice to have very useful 
i bought this for the beach and absolutely love it it provides plenty of shade for our child and even enough air flow i especially like the mat that extends out which enables us to sit on it while our child sleepsplays inside highly recommend purchasing this product for the beach 
It arrived with minor chips but we kept it anyway because we needed it for the camper We like it  
Neat idea but they all chipped up VERY easily 
When I first ordered this the set I received had chips in the bowl and mug Amazon replace it for me right away The dishes are light weight and perfect for camping I love how the utensils come in a pouch The knives are sharp enough to cut through steak 
high quality good price very compact 
Nice addon set for your tent if youve lost any of the stakes The hammer was a bit cheaply made but it served its purpose too 
I have a coleman tent This is a nice kit to have inside the tent carrier to hammer in the stakes and back up stakes 
Used the mallet and broom mostly for first camping trip this year with 7 people in and out of the tent 
This was the worst item i have ever purchased It ripped along the seam first time i used it There was only light wind and i followed the instructions I would not recommend to anyone 
Perfect size sun shade for all weather Lasted well in the rain and in the sun Multiple vents allow a breeze to pass through so you do not overheat Deals in heat when the vents are closed The attached mat allows you to enclose the tent completely Making it a small two person tent in a pinch Set up takes maybe 10 minutes 
I bought this kit to use in my 4person tent The brush and dustpan are very useful as is the rubber mallet The included stakes are thicker and stiffer than most stakes that come with tents but you only get 4 in the package Finally the stake puller tool makes campsite takedown effortless For 12 you get a host of useful items in side a convenient mesh carrying bag 
Nice little kit that is easy to throw in to the camping box Mallet is great extra duty tent stakes were good to have broom okay for light work stake pull up thing could be a lot more heavy duty to work better 
Only plan to tent from the trunk of a car so easy to haul the extra weight of this kit Rubber mallet for driving stakes in hook thing for pulling them out dust pan for tent cleanout and a nice zipper bag to hold the works Good aid to problem free tent erecting 
Love the old timey camp look of these BUT the metal gets hot when eating fresh off the grill food from your lap around the campfire AND makes for a cold meal quickly when temps are cooler 
The stainless silverware rusted Emailed Coleman said that was expected and did not offer an apology or to help out Who makes Stainless steal silverware to rust CRAP Coleman used to be a brand that represented quality well guess again boys and girls Now Coleman just makes Crap 
Perfect kit for car camping like the utensil holder Everything organized I must get a bag 
wow 100 percent recommended 
Love it Not as bright as the old thorium mantle units Maybe 30 percent less bright Still a way better light than any battery ran lantern I love the sound and the warmth It reminds me of my childhood The quality is as good as it has always been and that surprises me Thanks Coleman 
Beautiful replacement for my 1970s model that had seen better days would definitely buy again 
A must have item 
This lantern is awesome and gives the perfect type of orange glow to a camp site Ive had this lantern for a few years and used it several times there have been no problems lighting this lantern and the brightness is very adjustable from a dim glow to bright enough that it hurts to look at if your eyes are adjusted to the darkness You do need to pump it every hour or so or it will eventually go out Most negative reviews of Coleman products tend to focus on poor construction of their current products relative to the lanterns of yesteryear but this lantern is constructed perfectly fine and I expect it to last decades 
 Please Note This is a repost and reedit of a review of the dual fuel lantern WITHOUT the hard case written 10 JUN 14 and includes new information  Amazon no longer lists the lantern this review was originally for even though its the same exact lantern as the one offered here  Also please note that the lantern and case offered here costs less than the lantern alone from WalMart so this is likely the best way to go Are the lanterns sold through WalMart of a different quality from those sold through other retail outlets or is Colemans overall quality declining Hard to say which but it took SIX of these from WalMart to get three that worked after a fashion and even then had to replace the pressure valve in one tank wouldnt pressurize after only six or eight uses and the pump cup in another very stiff draggy pump action even after proper lubrication  I just got to the point where I didnt want to hassle with bringing numbers 4 and 5 back I occasionally have to use three of these in the nesting barn hung from the ceiling in a row spaced about sixteen feet apart and the difference in the amount of light each individual lantern put outs is quite apparent Using unleaded gasoline two are reasonably brightish in an orangey sort of way but still dont put out as much light as I remember the green Coleman Fuel Only lanterns producing and the light is NOT bright white but the third is only about twothirds as bright as the others no matter how I tweak it or what variables I change Ive tried all the bigname unleaded gasoline brands as well as the cheapies  10 ethanol blend which is about all they sell in and around Mount Goatmore Texas and pure gasoline when I can find it  and it doesnt seem to make much difference The dual fuel lanterns work just fine with Coleman fuel but then whats the point of paying the premium for the alleged dual fuel capability and work almost as well with a 5050 mix of Coleman Fuel and 10 ethanol unleaded gasoline which is the route Im going Their light output with the 5050 mix is still not quite bright white but it IS brighter and less orangey than using unleaded gasoline alone Ill likely have to dig down to the bottom of my camping box and see if I still have any of the lantern mantles from the 80s that were made with thorium and were BRIGHT  BRIGHT  BRIGHT and see if that helps any Things to consider 1 If youre going to store it fueled up for emergency use store it 34 filled with Coleman fuel and NOT unleaded gasoline 2 Buy the hard plastic storage case if it is not included as part of a package  worth every penny Make sure the bottom tabs are properly secured when you close the case Ive never had a problem with the case bottom coming unfastened and dropping the lantern I have these three lanterns two green Coleman Fuel lanterns and one 1975 red single mantle lantern  all in Coleman plastic cases but other reviewers have experienced this 3 A longnose disposable butane utility lighter will make lighting a snap and will store inside the hard plastic storage case 4 Two or three packs of spare mantles will store under the lantern in the hard plastic storage case 
I like this tent It takes a little bit to set it up properly but its something you can get used to I like that you can zip it all the way up in case you want to change your clothing or tap a nap and not be disturbed Im 54 and I can lay across it completely stretched out I use this for volleyball tournaments Its great to keep the sun and rain out where other canopies with no sides do NOT do that well 
This half tank was the only one left standing at the beach after a 30 minute significant wind Plus it provides great shade when needed 
I purchased this for a trip to Glacier National Park and for other camping adventures It folds down to a very packable size The fuel container takes white gas available at all camping stores It starts easily and burns hot  both burners but particularly the primary burner There is enough stovetop space for a frying pan and a smaller kettle for sides I have owned two of these units and am happy with both My current stove has a slight problem in that the fuel container does not fit snugly in the cutouts I will need to do some bending of the inserts to get it to stay in place thus the 4star rating There are two side wind shields that help contain the heat from the burners under the grill area After each use purge the fuel container of excess pressure to make the gaskets last longer Periodically oil the plunger for years of troublefree use My last unit lasted over 25 years This one has quality improvements in the fuel container and the burners so I expect it to perform better than the last and hopefully last just as long konedog 
My green suitcase coleman is 46 years old and running like a champ If you are into disposable material goods then dont pick this stove If you want to hand it down through the family to your kids and grandkids then snag it now About fuels Coleman fuel stoves run signifigantly cheaper than propane leave no bottles to dispose of and do not have problems at high altitudes or low temps like propane models can The dualfual colemans silver tanks are nice for emergency purposes but Coleman suggests you run coleman fuel in them instead of unleaded anyhow to keep from fouling the generator 
This 425 2burner Coleman stove has remained relatively unchanged in more than 50 years This stove is simple mechanically bombproof and offers features unmatched by todays assortment of higherpriced more convenient stoves For example the 425 may be found nearly everywhere and shares rarely needed replacement parts across the product line Tanks valves and generators are nearly interchangeable The stove is easy to clean spacious and offers two burners the main with a higher output and a secondary controlled by a simple turn key on the lefthand side of the stove case for simmering This means that Iron Chefwannabes can easily cook multiple entrees or multicourse meals on the camp table The case offers a builtin windscreen The tank is suspended by two tabs although you can pin the tank if desired The pump uses the ubiquitous Coleman pump assembly although more recently this assembly uses a plastic washer This stove will last a lifetime and you will not be disappointed It is one of the most classic stove designs in history 
My 2 burner Coleman Dual Fuel stove is one that my father bought when I was a kid to take camping in our pop up I remember many meals prepared on it back then I stopped camping for about 25 years and just recently decided to start camping again with my family I knew the Coleman would have to come with us So I got my Dads old Coleman stove and put a little Coleman fuel in it pumped it up and it still runs like a champ This is one piece of camping equipment that is nearly indestructible if you take any care of it at all I know this stove sat unused for at least 20 years and probably a good bit longer As stated by others not backpacking equipment but perfect for rving and car camping This is one of the few products made by any company that lives up to its reputation and actually exceeds it by a fair margin You really cant go wrong with this little stove Easy to use easy to transport and it will outlast you most likely Its something that can be handed down to your kids or even grandkids someday 
Have taken the set camping with us twice and has held up great Only wish it came with a nice reusable carrying case So nice not having to worry about buying plastic platesbowlsforksspoonsknives and cups every time we go camping A lot less wasteful too I have a feeling I will have this set for a long long long time and would definitely recommend buying a set 
The enamelware is nice and extremely adequate Nothing special but typical The utensils are pretty cheap but seem so far to hold up well 
Dinnerware set arrived in great condition Placed it all in a mesh or netted carry sack and it survived the first camping trip without damage The silverware is not as substantial as I hoped for However for a camping trip it is fine I look forward to many years of use 
Hard to find the enamelware these days and this set was great I wish that it had a little carry case to pack it all up into instead of just for the cutlery but so far they have been great I put them through their paces and I foresee them lasting our scouting family a nice long time I would buy it again Mugs are decent sized too and the knives cut meat nicely 
Ok the paint on it is uneven and looks like a job made in China Easily dings and chips 
not real high quality for a Coleman The hook is nice for removing stakes I only got 4 stakes with mine So you will want additional ones The stakes are great The hammer was ok Kinda wobbled at the top when using The broom and dust pan are VERY small So if you are getting a big tent think again 
I was afraid my tent might be missing some important part since i had never set it up so I bought this tent kit I ended up using the mallet and almost used the stake puller Very helpful and I would recommend it for nice extras 
Very usefull kit for camping Swept out our tent hammard down the spikes everything stayed clean and secure and the little bag keeps things organized 
Great lantern everything you have come to expect from Coleman Good Buy 
Super bright Dependable I never go fishing or camping without this light I finally had to buy a new one when my old Coleman lantern gave out after more than 15 years Love these lights 
Come on was there ever any doubt This is the stove that took America camping in the first place The newer Miltie fuel versions are nice but this is still old reliable Mine is a third generation hand me down and I can still get parts for it The best part is that IT HAS NEVER NEEDED REPAIR EVER 
Great 
I liked the dishes and they worked well the spoons were sharp on the edges and cut the inside of my mouth while eating for the first time The coffee handles could be bigger to keep you hands from burning I would recommend using some steel wool on the spoons before using 
Had it a year so far nothing has broken Not bad for the price 
Great product Excellent service Will order again 
Good product 
Decent quality but takes time to setup Looking back I would have bough something easier to setup 
OMG so much fun on the beach with the product Excellent shade and wind protection Too bad I didnt have it sooner when kids were small 
At first it looked great But the plastic stakes to anchor the corners are weak and will break after a few uses I had to replace with metal ones from hardware store There are no simple ways to adjust lines to short courts need measuring tape and sharpie And the surplus line from the short court adjustment left a tail ribboning either on the court or tangling with the actual boundary line I had to modify with 2 sliding buckles from the shoulder strap of 2 old beach bags Finally there is nothing included to correctly wrap up the lines had to purchase one at local hardware store But the initial price is still acceptable for the blue 1 lines 
Found this set to be very functional and in fact was used by many in camp The mallet is light and yet sturdy The tent stake pull came in hand and was used by all didnt have to break my back puling up the stakes The tent stakes are well made and I was glad I had them as my tent was missing some stakes The broom and dust pan helped out in keeping the tent clean 
Although the stakes are kind of flimsy on the top this is a very nice kit to have I suggest any camper get this 
This is a great lil kit to help put up take down and keep the tent clean the steaks that come with it are so nice i ended up buying more of them for my whole tent 
I have several coleman lanterns LOVE this one the best Not tried to burn unleaded gas in it yet but nice to know it is an option If you are looking for a classic pressure lantern this is the best and only choice  
Classic Rugged Easy These lanterns have been around forever and for good reason You cant go wrong with this The case is more for protection than carrying Get a flat web strap and tie it around it to prevent it from falling out when you carry it Other than that this lantern is top notch 
As expected and advertised Arrived quickly 
GREAT campling light can use gas or fuel LOve it for my backup if we run out of propane throw a little gas from the truck in her and we are great to go 
Great deal Used these the day after i got them and they work greatwash easily and just overall are awesome 
If you are a camper you NEED this set 
I love this beach shade It takes about ten minutes for one person to set up which is fairly easy although the poles dont stay snapped together well and do get caught in the sleeves during both setup and takedown Its large enough for two camping chairs or a few people sitting on the ground It can be completely closed up and it has ventilation screens just like a tent It provides a good deal of shade It doesnt work well on windy days since it catches wind like a sail but Im happy with this purchase and recommend it 

This is absolutely amazing for a little shelter for a day at the beach The pockets inside organize your stuff There is even a drying line I believe you could zip this up and use it as a 1person tent Solid construction and not that difficult to put up If you want to duck out of the shade and prevent sunburn this is the way to go We are really happy with it and expect a lot of use out of it in our beach town It very comfortably fits two people and you could squeeze in 3 A family with small kids would work too I may buy another one for other family members Also most people seem to have blue or orange beach tents  the green and gray is easier to pick out of the crowd 
Purchased this to keep the sun off my kids during track meets in the summer Unfortunately its more like an oven despite having a window in the back and completely open in the front Size wise the shade is fine for two people and their stuff  an adult in a chair can fit in the center of the shade  but any more than that is pushing it I was able to put this up myself without any assistance which was nice The metal rivets came out of several holes where the poles go The shade is still usable but it was disappointing to have it happen on the first use Overall its just ok I wouldnt recommend it over a traditional shade that sits atop 4 poles 
I bought the Coleman 8 person instant tent and even when it came with 4 metal stakes this kit is awesome 
This kit came in handy on our last camping trip Our screen in table top had missing stakes from the box Dont you just wonder how things just seem to either fall out or just simply vanish in thin air Well luckily I had bought this kit just in case we needed it And wow we did Kit is very cheap in price and worked great for us 
Good little camp kit Dust pan and broom came in handy to sweep all the dirt out Perfect if you are looking for a compact style 
great 
Cool for camping Nice and durable 
Great lightweight dinner set Dont expect to use it for your daughters wedding or display in your china hutch theyre meant to be used as a lightweight easy to carry set for camping or traveling and great value for the price 
Cool 
This thing is great  a must have for every beach bum 
Just right for emergencies Never have had any problem with it Dualfuel beats propane Nice sturdy case as well 
Reminds me of going camping when I was a young boy Hated these lantern when I was growing up But I appreciate them now its bright and takes less space when I go camping No extra bottles to take with me just one small gas can and it last and last 
Very good product and price shipping was on time and free is the only way to go 
Great lantern Great case 
This item is exactly as described Very pleased with the purchase I was happy that Amazon suggested this item as an addon to my tent purchase The tent came with spikes but they were small and virtually useless and didnt have the mallet or stakepuller  all very handy Got this for my 12 year old son  he had no problems setting up the tent and pulling it down 
I got this when I purchased my Coleman 4person instant tent with a special offer that got me this product for free I dont think I would have purchased this product otherwise but the mallet is solid and the tent stakes are tough although the plastic heads if you could call it that are a bit weak but they have worked well so far 
This tent kit is not necessary but I found it very helpful The stakes have a larger head than normal stakes which made them much easier to push into the ground and to pull back out The mallet was easier to use than the bottom of a shoe My partner enjoyed the broom Other reviews were correct about the lack of strength in the tool that pulls the stakes out but I still found it easier to use than my fingers For the price of this kit I think its a worthwhile purchase 
This tent kit is wonderful I love and use all of the components except the bag  dont know what happened to that The mallet and stakes work perfectly and the hook thingy is amazing The broom is nice too but any cheapo one of those would do 
This is a convenient all in one little kit Nothing fancy but everything you need and includes the mesh storage bag 
Pretty poor quality product The plates have many spots where the enamel wasnt applied correctly so you can see where a worker brushed on red paint to hide it The forks and spoons are flat Yes flat No way you could use the spoons to eat anything except really think mashed potatoes or something Rubbish I kept the set just because the bowls and plates where serviceable for camping The silverware isnt bad enough to throw away but it isnt good enough to use forks and spoons the knives arent bad but as a set they just dont work But this set cheap and then get silverware from REI 
As advertised very pleased with this product 
Thank you and I look forward to other offers 
Fantastic lantern that works precisely as it should This lantern is very well made provides an astounding amount of light and is the perfect size I believe this is a must have item Under certain circumstances batteries for other lighting devices could potentially be hard to come by While unlikely the piece of mind provided by having a lantern that can operate not only on camp fuel but readily available unleaded gasoline is a plus I am a fan of the Coleman Brand and while many of their products may not stack up to those offered years ago not much does these days this lantern is one of the exceptions along with their Dual Fuel Stove that if properly maintained will last you a lifetime 
Id never used one before so it took me a little while to get it working properly but its a Great lantern The ability to run on unleaded gasoline is nice for a rough times scenario Obviously this isnt what you want for a bug out bag but its a great camp light 
Outstanding product and easy to maintain Not an issue after a year in the field 
I took this out on my first camping trip and it immediately proved to be one of my most essential pieces of gear The spikes were sturdy and 10 times better than the spikes that came with my tent The small broom kit was used several times throughout the day to get rid of the leaves and dirt my dog kept tracking into the tent The mesh bag made everything easy to pack up and take along I loaned this kit less the spikes to a friend I went camping with to both set up and break down his tent as well as to clean it out and by the end of our trip he was ordering one for himself This kit is an absolute must 
I like the package and knowing that if I loose a piece I know that I have spare parts to bail me out 
My tent stayed clean and I didnt loose my tent spikes I like the carrying bag it comes with clean  well kept 
the whole set works great bought extra stakes because i have a larger tent that required more than four tent stakes The easy remover tool works well when your in tough soil And the hammer is awesome large style generic mallet 
son responsables y muy atentos lo que solicite me lo enviaron en el tiempo estipulado por eso seguir comprando con ellos 
Gift for someone 
Great Product and service would recommend to anyone Thank U 

Was a bit difficult to put up on a windy beach but one in our family burns so easily it was really needed and was just what we wanted Coleman makes a good product 
Worked great for our family vacation to the beach The size was fine The primary intention was for cover from the sun Our family all sat inside of it and ate lunch Might be difficult for one person to assemble by themselves 
Edited to add took the shade out for the first this this season the second year and one of the poles snapped The wind wasnt very strong Im disappointed We probably used it 6 times last year Im hoping I can get a replacement pole somewhere this shade was GREAT over the summer at the beach it was a lifesaver to keep the baby out of the sun and wind HOWEVER it is really difficult to set up and take down and nearly impossible for one person to do alone When there is wind it gets even more difficult I love it once set up but beware it take a little work 
easy setup works great for what it is Used on the beach 
This includes the little extra bits and pieces that you sometimes forget when camping The extra stakes are there when you hit stony ground The stake puller saves your fingers and the bag allows storage in the center of your tent And the mallet  well the back of your camp axe will thank you 
I LOVE IT MY SON LOVES IT GREAT BUY VERY DURABLE AND STYLISH WOULD DEFINETELY RECOMMEND AND WILL BUY ANOTHER ONE SOON 
bought mainly for hammer and stakes which i loose a lot its good and easy to keep track of with the bag havnt lost one since this purchase 
Easy to use packs super small into my tent bag It is super awesome to throw in the car and clean up the campsite 
Set up would be easier for a pop up but those are double the price Worked great at the beach and is very large inside 
Perfect for the beach I eve travel with this thing sometimes 
works very well  just got back from 5days in woodszero degrees lights quickly and puts out plenty of light Case works but is flimsy for a Coleman product 
reminds me of camping with my dad Great product Takes a bit of tinkering if havent used one in a while but after 3 rd or fourth time of use better than a light lantern 
Not a bad lantern Is closer to the size of the propane models than the traditional white gas lanterns No complaints with either the lantern or the case 
Nice little lamp I have not tried it out with gasoline however it is a nice option to have in a pinch The white you will works very well and the one tank lasts a good while I have the propane version of this one and they work about the same The only difference on this lamp is that you have to pump it up about every 30 minutes on HIGH or about every hour if its not burning as bright I got a free funnel with the lamp and I like the carrying case to keep it protected 
As described Thanks 
Great for camping Stores easy and the enamel wear holds up nicely 
Perfect set for any outdoor person or family Nice and compact yet thoughtful for camping and picnic needs 
Very handy and good quality 
is an iron material in other words what you pay  
These were a wedding gift for my sister She has a set of black ones that were my parents and well over 40 years old Needless to say the old set was well worn and chipped My sister loves color so we got her these They are slightly larger than the old plates which is great She loves them and uses them daily 
super 
Great set of lines that adjust from 2s to 4s Thats very convenient 
Great value for the money pretty much the best boundary lines you can get if you want adjustable lines We play 6s and doubles even on grass The good Well built good quality Quickly adjustable 2 thick lines By far best price Very quick shipping The bad Definitely need new stakes the plastic ones the come with it are worthless easily broken when playing in grass and also takes too much effort to get them into the ground I bought the metal ones from camping section at walmart for 99 cents each  a must Lines also dont come pre marked or measured for a short court so need to measure out the 2s court and either spray paint or put some kind of mark on the lines for future This set doesnt come with any kind of rack to wrap the line around when youre done but for this price cant really complain It takes a bit longer packing it all nice and even on my arm but it works Again A quality youre really getting a great value and with a few more  and a tape measure and some time you get professional boundary lines that are easily adjustable 
The items will fit in the bag but the broom has to be put in a certain way or the bristles stick through the mesh The pins like all the included components are great but the pins will eventually stick through the bag 
The essentials for setting up and taking down your tent are right here The minibroomanddustpan combo is probably my favorite part It lets you keep all the grit and bits out of your tent really easily The mallet stakes and stakepuller are good quality and very handy to have The stakes are easy to put in and pull out thanks to good design of the end caps If you want a kit to take camping this should be on the top of your list 
Its Coleman Better than expected especially for the price The tent spikes were especially sturdy and the sweeper was a bonus 
The only complaint I have with this is that it comes with a mesh pouch so if you do not cover the tent spikes they will just poke through 
great shade while on the beach a bit of work to set up and take down each time but worth it 
We took this beach shade on our trip down the Oregon coast all the way to the redwoods It got set up and taken down several times without any problems what so ever I highly recommend this Coleman product 
Please dont waste your time or money on this Coleman used to stand for quality products but that is rare in these days Items come chipped from shipping According to other reviewers even if not chipped on shipping they will soon chip from normal use I would venture to say that using these items with chips you would be risk health hazards from the bare imported steel 
enamel chipped on one cup and another cup had most of enamel off on both inside and out side with rust note inside very cheat quality 
Works Great 
Very useful Wish they sold the utensil carrier seperately Would have bought just that But dishes come in handy too 
Good use for camping is awesome 
Only used once and its ok only wide enough for 2 small beach chairs not the large rio beach chairs easy set up when there is no wind needed help to set up on windy beach and the small bags filled with wet sand held the tent in place 
Bought this mainly for the stakes and stake puller Needed more heavy duty stakes for my Coleman Sundome tent Stakes will hold your tent down like a rock Unfortunately the stake puller is too weak to pull them out of the ground The plastic top of the stake will also break when trying to get these out The stake puller is simply a metal aluminum maybe rod bent to a W shape with a handle on one end It will get a stake out of soft wet ground but will bend in drier harder soil Im not talking rocky soil the stakes went into the ground with the help of the rubber hammer that comes with the kit Getting them out first bent the puller then broke the plastic end of the stake finally required a camp shovel 
bought this when i got my tent and found it all useful particularly the stakes as the ones that came with the tent were flimsy in hard soil bought more to replace the rest in the tent set 
This was part of the same deal as the Coleman light package when I purchased the tent would not buy it on its own 
After the last Family Camp I ordered 2 of these kitsone for my Son and family and one for me You never know what the ground pound will entail especially in windy locations 
Used it immediately upon arrival Comes in the black mesh bag which isnt the most convenient thing but probably the best option considering the brush and dust pan are used to clean up messes If you had an unbreatheable bag it would build up with debris The added stakes are a nice addition to my set and allowed me to replace some of my older defunct pieces 
Works very well Instructions are clear and very thorough 
Love it Bright reliable light source Dual fuel makes it even better for flexibility Its Coleman  they have been doing the camping business for a LONG time and have it mostly figured out Parts are readily available at just about every store from the big box locations to the momnpop outdoors stores should you ever need to make repairs or just buy some replacement mantles Solid quality 
We had a couple of these years ago We are pretty serious about camping and I know a thing or two about Coleman liquid fueled lanterns so I wanted to share my experience with the Dual Fuel model Its a liquidfueled two sock mantle lantern It burns either gasoline regular unleaded or Colemans camp fuel a classified mixture probably mostly naphtha and some additives for storage life You have adjustable light outputs and runs on air pressure Its incredibly simple and there are few moving parts so its incredibly reliable You can also repair it if something breaks or wears out Its made almost entirely of steel with the exception of brass generator and pump parts and the brass fuel cap plastic fuel control knob thats been coated in enamel the chimney and top cap for long life and heat resistance The fuel tank is painted heavy gauge steel and the rest of the lantern globe holderbase heat shield valve shroud is stamped galvanized sheet steel It will last a long time if you take care of it Its simple how it works The pressurized fuel is squirted up the brass generator to a burner at the top The fuel is sprayed out of the generator and disperses in the burner The operation depends on high temperatures to work right so it has to warm up hence the mantles being close to the generator The heat vaporizes the fuel into a gas and it passes down the burner stalks and is ignited which burns very hot and makes the mantles glow If lighting for the first time you need to burnin the mantles Make sure theyre tied tightly to the burner stalks Doesnt matter how they are positioned Fill the fuel tank dont overfill it or youll get leaks and it could catch fire when you light it cap it Unscrew the pump 2 turns and pump it up 3050 times Make sure your thumb covers the vent hole on the pump knob Dont over pump it When it gets stiff stop If youre burning in the mantles light them on fire I use a barbecue lighter to reach through the hole on the globe support and light each mantle Let them burn until they are mostly white ash and while they are burning open the fuel valve until you get fire Dont turn it up high keep it on low until the mantles are completely burned and are white Youll get fire coming out of the burners and thats normal until the generator gets hot and vaporizes the fuel It takes about a minute for it to reach operating temperature and the mantles start glowing on their own and the fire stops You might have to pump it some more while its lighting for more pressure Thats it It can be kind of intimidating at first with the fire coming out but thats normal and will go away Dont worry it wont explode Just dont turn the fuel valve on high while its doing that or you could get big fire Once youve done it a couple times you get used to it Its really bright on full blast Will light up a campsite no problem Brighter than an LED lantern and the fuel tank will last you about 810 hours on full power I have run it two evenings and nights before and only used 34 of the fuel so it lasts quite a while It can burn either regular unleaded gasoline or Colemans own fuel I prefer gasoline because its cheaper about 350 a gallon opposed to almost 9 for the other stuff I noticed it doesnt run as long or get as bright on gasoline but the difference is made up for in the cost savings Its very durable The only real issue I had was from taking them razor clamming and getting ocean water on them which rusted the exposed metal and made a real mess of the lantern It still worked fine though after some cleaning If you properly maintain it it will last for decades The only consumable parts are the mantles and possibly the rubber seal in the air pump piston which can dry rot over time if not kept oiled use a medium oil you want something viscous like just regular general purpose oil I use Hoppes oil Everything else lasts a long time the life of the lantern If something does go bad you can order a new part from Coleman I rebuilt another one of these not dual fuel with offshelf parts and some parts I had to order from Coleman it works great Its also cheap to fix On the downside not really a fault of the lantern is that you cant take it in a tent with you like an LED lamp It makes carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide on gasoline plus it gets real hot It makes a great hand warmer though Its also fragile due to the glass globe and mantles so you have to be a little careful transporting it The plastic cover is nice but make sure the locking tabs are pressed into the base to keep it from falling out Plus it can hold mantles in the space under the fuel tank Pros Very bright Lasts forever Uses cheap unleaded gas Easy to maintain Long run time Cons Can be intimidating the first time you use it Not cheap If I had a choice between an LED lamp and this Id probably choose both LED for in my tent and the gas for outside Its not cheap and is designed for outdoor use only but you cant fault it It is super bright will last for thousands of hours and is cheap to run Gets my high recommendation 
I love this lamp I went through a few mantels at first but now the mantle seems to be lasting forever And Ive been using gasoline onlyive burned almost 2 gal by now thats a lot of burn time I burn this lamp all night long when Im in bear country It will last all night long if you fill it full and not at full blast I only put it on full blast if Im setting up tent at night its so bright it hurts your eyes at full blast 
ok 
Decent item  we purchased this set because we didnt want plastic mess kits For the price I expected a little more quality Pros Durable not plastic good size Cons Sharp edges on bowls and plates I would imagine kids fingers might get cut Silverware is pretty cheaply made 
A very durable set of campware I am enjoying it and yes as others say the flatware is flimsy but work just great 
The utensils seem very cheap and one of the cups arrived with a burn hole in it Also the material is so thin that if you poor anything hot in the cup it becomes so hot that you cant hold it 
great dishes now i need to go camping 
This is an amazing set The dishes are perfect for dinners when camping The cups are perfect for coffee hot cocoa tea etc The silverware and everything else was easy to clean and keep Definitely a wonderful addition to any camping experience 
ok 
Great to have 
I used the hammer to help put up Christmas decorations in the yard and the other pieces fit great in with my camping gear I even use the broom combo to clean up around the house during craft projects 
The Coleman Tent Kit is a cheap set if you know that going in it is fine I would not recommend this for hard core campers or areas of really hard ground The stake puller bends very easy 2 of the stakes bent but the mallet and broom work pretty well Over all It is a good deal to get you by 
The tent stakes alone make it worth the price Add in the mallet and stake puller and you have a sweet deal This is a must add on to any tent 
perfect for my outdoor courts 
This is a great tent for the beach I can set it up by myself in 10min I used it in the outer banks and it was fairly windy but if you dig down and really bury the sand anchors it has no issue in the wind It packs down to nothing the bag is a little bigger then a cling wrap box which is great when you hauling everything to the beach 
works perfectly for a picnic and an overnight camping trip for 1 person 
This is a great set for backyard or sand volleyball action  at first it seemed like a HUGE long net but its just right for 2 on 2 or more volleyball setup is easy and definitely requires a minimum of 2 people  I bring it in after use but it can probably hold up to some weather  well made simple design 
This is a great product It does exactly what it is supposed to do 
This lantern works just as good as my original 30 year old Coleman lantern I used Coleman fuel in it for my camping trip so I do not know how it works with gasoline but it is good to know I could use regular gas in an emergency It doesnt have the lighting lever I was used to but doesnt seem to need it Lights fast and bright My only complaint is the locks on the hard case It can let loose and drop the lantern on the ground possibly breaking it I will be keeping a cord around it next time so it does not fall out again The case does protect the lantern during travelling 
Very good 
Arrived promptly Plastic housing held the lantern securely Lantern worked fine able to fine tune the illumination Great product highly recommend 
Easy to set up and in the sand it stays put 
Fantastic for summer fun with the kids friends family etc Easy to setup and holds up well You will never mistake this for a professional volleyball setup but that is not what we wanted This is perfect for the summer and hope it lasts several years 
The net is great strong enough to withstand a small windstorm that passed through The stakes to hold in the guy lines are a bit short for soft soil and the ball would not hold air at all so if you replace the stakes and throw the ball away its a fine net for the price 
Ill have to admit this is a nice little kit and Im glad I bought it I have other rubber mallets but its good having one dedicated to this task and a helluva lot better than using a rock The stakes are much stronger than the super cheap stuff included with most tents including ours Im amazed to have to admit that Ive actually used the little stake puller thinger dinger and even the goofy little broomdustpan is surprisingly handy in the tent We use all of it highly recommended 
The items included are exactly what every camper needs to secure and sweep out their tent and the mesh bag that holds the items is sturdy and has a secure closure 
I am really supprised that Coleman put thier name on this kit Well sorry two pieces in this kit What I am talking sbout is what they call a dust pan and dust broom These items should be included in a childs tent kit The dust pan dosent even measure 5 X 5 Same with the dust broom if that is what it is The mallot seems to be really sturdy and well made The tent stakes seem alright considering they have a plastic top We will see how the stake puller works when I tear down the tentupdate commimg All in all I am not really happy with this kit but I guess it is Ok for the price 
The included stakes are much better than what comes with my Colman tent Very nice addition to my tent The stake removal tool was very handy as the included stakes are long and were difficult to remove thats a good thing as it was very windy and they did not budge without it 
Very handy kit to have for tent setup and cleanup I love all parts of this kit except that the bag is too small to easily put everything back in Not a huge deal bc I just put the broom  dustpan in the tent bag itself 
I bought this for the hammer and broom but ended up using the tent pegs as well Theyre much stronger than the tent pegs that come with a tent and the hammer makes putting them quick and easy The broom was a life saver since the blanket I used was an old beach blanket that had some sand on it After a few sweeps with the broom the sand was out the door The only reason Im not giving this 5 stars is the bag catches on the broom when you put it in and take it out I would rather have a slightly bigger bag for all these items If you own a tent you should seriously consider getting this even if you dont think youll use it 
Great set seems plenty durable Ive had it set up in our yard for almost a year at this point We dont take it down often and never travel with it so I cant comment on that type of usage But as a backyard net I find it perfectly high quality Of course its not a professional net Guess what we arent professional players But this sees family caliber play probably 6 days a week and has held up fine It has been outside continuously since Christmas 2014 and I just came inside from a game and thought Id drop a review This may sound dumb but make sure you have a good spot for it I have a decent sized yard and assumed I would When it actually arrive and we set it up turned out that to avoid overhanging trees water hazards by the lake gardening beds etc this thing now lives right smack dab in the middle of our frontyard Honestly I find that a lot less tacky than most peoples holiday decorations Merry Volleyball Day 
A 
This is the best yard volleyball set I could find It is excellent because it is easy to set up full size and acts like a normal gym net when the ball hits it instead of those flimsy cheap yard volleyball sets The boundary marker string and air hand pump are also excellent The only bad part about this set is the volleyball that is included sucks Mine couldnt even hold air so I just threw it out and bought a different one 
This puts out as much light as my other coleman propane heater I will have to add though that the lantern does NOT shut off unless you open the fuel cap and allow the gas to escape I had left the lantern on its lowest setting and only noticed the heat when I went to put it away and realized it was still burning I removed just one star because the instructions say it will shut off all on its own 
I bought this for camping and am very happy with the lantern itself But the case will pop open if it is squeezed on the opposite sides of the clasps that hold the bottom on I rated the lantern a 5 and the case a 3 so 4 stars overall I went to a big box hardware store and found the perfect solution a 36 bungee cord This is just the right length to go around the bottom and secure both hooks at the top I tested this setup with a 7 lb rock and I shook it and bounced it and it stayed in there and did not fall out The case will sit mostly level with the bungee on The complaints I read about are mostly about the case and not the lantern which is a really great lantern So buy without worrying just pick up a 36 bungee cord and dont worry about the lantern ever falling out of the case again 
I have received my Coleman duel fuel lantern intact well packed and trouble free Other reviewed the case as not very secure but my case has this issue addressed The tabs on the bottom no have positive locking tabs with little nubs so it is a lot more secure Over extended use I could see them wearing down but new it is solid and I can carry the well built sturdy and solid feeling lantern by the handle and not worry about the bottom dropping out I have owned this type of duel fuel in the past and probably put thirty or forty gallons of fuel thru it before it finally gave up the ghost That is a lot of use Well worth the price point And running it on unleaded gas instead of white gas is very cheap 1 gallon of gas is nice and portable and will run this thing for around 50 hours depending on how bright you want your site Coleman does a few things right and this is one of them Also glad they listed to feedback and resolved the case issue 
I bought this Coleman lantern to use while RV camping I have had Coleman lanterns for many years and they have always been good I think this new one is the best one I have ever bought It is well made and I like the carrying case 
This lantern is easy to use and bright The control allows you to easily adjust the brightness and the ability to use multiple types of fuel makes this item flexible as well 
LOVE IT very roomie and easy to get privacy 
Dont go camping with out them 
very nice set I gave it as a gift for camping my cousin loved them 
Not bad  Some of the enamel fell off quite easily but its a half decent set for the odd weekend away with the fam 
Great product 
Like other reviews mine came chipped It was one of the mugs Feel dumb for buying a dining kit in the first place because the last thing you wanna do while camping is wash dishes We ended up using paper plates Only used two of the mugs for coffee in the morning Other than the chipped mug they seemed ok 
I would have given this 5 stars except for one glaring issue The posts that are meant to be nailed into the ground are made of a flimsy plastic When installing this they would quickly bend when getting hit by a hammer We had to make some of our own steel spikes to anchor it properly Tip If you do buy this buy some metal or steel posts instead to anchor the lines 
Perfect for warm water at the campsite 
Left it out in the Phoenix sun for 8 hours and never got hot 
As described Fast shipping Thank you 
First impression was good and I was really excited to use this shower while camping although there isnt anyway to close the tube so the water keeps running I had to bend it and put rubber band around it to make it stop even though I rinsed with baking soda as instuctions said water smelled like chemicals rubber or plastic and the second day I accidentally dropped it and the bag popped like water balloon even tho it was almost empty Wont but it again 
Looked like it was sturdy but it was Missing parts so I never got to use it had to return it 
Good quality easy set up 
Great sun shade Only issue is it takes a few minutes to setup longer than a standard tent The 2 vertical poles and the long horizontal pole are a bit difficult to break down and remove from the tent When its set up its great if a bit large I kind of felt like a jerk putting it up close to the water on a fairly crowded beach blocking the people behind us from seeing the water I would probably look to buy a shade structure with less vertical height and a bit easier to set up and break down It pretty easily fits 3 adults inside 
This provides great shade and has a good look A bit of a pain to set up initially but will likely get easier after doing it several times It also does get blown quite a bit by the wind We fit two adults and two little kids in it 
This was a great price for what you get The tent stakes are much better than the small ones the tent comes with those bend brake and sometimes are impossible to get out of the ground Everything in the kit is useful The only complaint I had was with the stake remover It broke the plastic part on a couple of stakes I found it more effective to just use the tent to pull the stakes out of the ground For the price though this cant be beat I almost bought two of them just to get more stakes 
We bought a great Coleman instant tent and thought we should get better stakes so I bought this kit because it was cheaper then just buying the stakes by themselves The stakes are great better then the little thin steel ones and the only ones I would ever use for a tent The little broom and dust pan you could probably buy at a Walmart but again you would pay about the same cost and still not get the stakes or the mallet or the stake puller The stake puller is made a bit flimsy but if you grasp with both hands the steel part below the handle and not the handle it wont bend The only complaint is the storage bag the netting is just plain stupid they should have used a solid nylon bag instead I gave it 5 stars because of the costs nothing spectacular about the package but it does what its intended to do 
Not bad but could be better and for anything but casual camping youll want better The best and most used feature is the broomdustpan Id love a bigger broom though If this is all you have youll do a lot of uncomfortable stooping and sweeping even a small tent will take forever it is very small A short broom that you can use on your knees or bent over while standing and using this as a dust brush will be better I love the dustpan it has a little indent so that sand and other small particles are less likely to fall out the front of the pan The broom and dustpan get 4 stars 5 for the pan 3 for the broom The mallet is OK Nice heavy rubber mallet However it isnt all that heavy duty and after several uses it is clear I will need to replace it at the end of this camping season The mallet is 33 12 stars The stakes before I used them I thought they were great The whole setup is quite inexpensive and these are some nice looking heavy duty stakes The flimsy stakes that come with most tents are only acceptable in perfect weather and having this kit in my trunk with these stakes gave me peace of mind Then last weekend it was very windy when I put up my tent and I didnt think the stock stakes would hold so I used these They did their job well they held the tent and stayed sturdy despite some pretty nasty windsthen I tried to break camp on Sunday Well these are 10 nail style stakes They hold well You need some real leverage to get them out The nail head offers nothing The plastic at the top broke At that point any hope of ever getting these out of the ground were gone I had to work my tent loops up and over the stakes and leave the stakes in the ground as there was no way I was ever getting them out Id suggest holding on to these for nothing but emergency use and buy a set of sturdy aluminum stakes with a metal loop at the top like the Kelty No Bendium stakes or with the nylon pull strings like the Coleman Heavy Duty stakes or MSR Ground Hogs The stakes are only 2 stars 2 and not 1 since they do work well as heavy duty stakes in a pinch but especially in hard ground or heavy roots youll never be able to recover them The stake puller is OK It seems like it is a bit flimsy When using the cheaper pegs that come with my tents it does a fine job pulling them up When using longer pegs like the aforementioned stakes that come with this set it did do some bending It is still useable but I think I will be looking for something heavier duty 3 stars So overall it is an OK set It probably serves best to keep it in your trunk at all times in case you need it and forgot something when packing for camping Price is good so if you are camping and forgot something and need something now and this is all the stores have youll be fine with it to fill in for your regular gear All the items seem a little flimsy for longterm use Good in a pinch not so good for your goto gear 
I say mini as it only has 4 tent stakes which I guess is just what you need to secure just your main supports The rubber hammer is perfect weight to be effective but not too heavy The little dirt broompan is nice but hard to get into mesh bag as bristles keep getting caught in bag The puller is great with my other tent stakes but when I used to pull out the included stakes it broke the plastic tops off the stakes Heavy duty stakes cheap plastic tops This puller works perfectly with the cheap plastic type stakes that have a round puller hole to insert into no breaking sure grip as well overall for the  a good little kit 
I used this tent kit on my first camp trip with the kids If I had bought each item separately it would have cost about twice as much than the kit itself The beefier tent stakes are much better than the metal twigs that came with the tent I used the rubber mallet to stake the four corners with the heavy duty stakes The whisk broom and pan came in very handy when it came time to pack up and clean up I swept up the tracked in grainy dirt It might have taken a little longer than a standard size whisk broom but I did not mind at all As long as all the dirt was swept up I was happy I showed my son how to use the stake puller and he did the rest on the other 11 stakes holding down the tent I recommend this kit to anyone without these items for camping It will make your trip a gratifying one 
This cute little kit is certainly convenient but as others have said youre better off just getting the pieces separately and packing them in your own bag The rubber mallet is the reason I bought this kit but I should have just used a regular old household hammer After all the claw end makes the stakepuller redundant The stakes themselves should only be used in an absolute emergency  they are really poor quality The plastic heads break easily and the metal hardly grips the dirt The broom thing is cute but it sheds bristles easily Im going to just buy a handheld brush from Home Depot and use my own dustpan in the future If you want to buy the set for convenience and not have to think about remembering to pack a hammer etc this kit is worth it I guess But if you already own a hammer and dustpan just buy a packet of nicer quality tent stakes and a nice handbrush and youll probably end up saving money in the long run 
This is my second lamp which I use while camping or making BBQ in the garden The lamp is very solid and gives very good light Its simple to start and also to regulate in brightness Just fill gas We purchased the combo since its cheaper as to buy them induvidually One of our lamps remains in the garden by the BBQ place and this goes on travel in the case The case is solid and protects the lamp very well The most fragile part of the lamp is the glass of course and there is no longer a risk to break it while on travel The case works in the way that the top is removed from the black bottom Then place the lamp must be cold on the bottom and replace the cover on the bottom We recommend to run th lamp on Coleman fuel or similar The fuel is very clean and there is no maintenance When using unleaded gas the generator has to be cleaned from time to time 
I often catch fish at night I used to use flashlights but they give a bunch of light directed When I bought this lamp I threw flashlights The lamp illuminates the great fishing spot She eats little fuel Very handy carrying case Light such that you can perfectly read a book waiting for the signal bite Lamp taxing on fuel and works great on the same fuel as my boat motor Now this lamp I have always with you 
We messed around with various LED lanterns Other than a small LED lantern that we use and like a lot for washroom trips in the middle of the night this lantern provides beautiful bright light that makes you feel good about being outdoors It is both useful and powerful and most importantly to me has a perfect quality to the light emitted The hard case should be viewed as protection for the lamp rather than a durable carrying case Hold it from the bottom the latches are adequate for this purpose but not for carrying 
Use this set in my Aliner It makes setting the table easy as everything is in the same plastic box which you choose Silverware is easy to find and keep track of with the folding holder Everything you need and it looks great not to mention you should be able to give this to the grandkids 
Very fast delivery and arrived in a quality shipping box No damages and was well packed The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars was due to the flatware having plastic handles If they were heavier duty handles this would have been a very durable set Time will tell how the handles hold up on the flatware but the dishes were just what we were looking for Nice sizes and will be great in elk camp next fall 
We are so happy with this set Love the color and it holds up well to our washing and eating needs Good quality and havent seen any rust like we did on another brand in the past Happy with the purchase 
Great durable love this volleyball set Highly recommended 
Good quality parts and easy to assemble If you are looking for a portable system that can be assembled and disassembled quickly I recommend this product 
This kit seems like a decent idea While some of it is the stakes specifically the tops just dont hold up The spike part of the stakes is fine However if youre just a hair off the cheap plastic tops will snap off in a heartbeat Whether staking down or pulling out To be honest the generic full plastic stakes that came with the tent held up better They may not last real long but for how quick these can break you can buy a couple buckets of the general plastic ones Naturally if you are camping in more rugged environments youll be spending the extra money for the really good stakes However for the general use car camper Id look past this set and load up on the cheaper heavier plastic ones The lack of quality in the hookeye portion of the stakes with this kit just arent worth the price 
Could go camping a hundred times and not miss the kit but its nice to have Heavy duty stakes are better then what came with my coleman tent which is good cause the NC mountains are a little rocky Stake puller is similar to a paper clip and fairly useless Mallet is better then I expected but isnt that solid and will eventually break Would Def recommend the kit 
Great idea to have your camping peripherals all in one kit However the tent stakes arent that great because the ends are plastic and Im not really sure how the stake puller is supposed to pull up stakes that arent just beaten into a sand box But having the rubber mallet and extra stakes is great 
We own both this Coleman Road Trip Beach Shade and the SportsBrella XL We brought both down to the Oregon coast last weekend and tried them both in the beach environment we normally use them for baseball games   Pros  The Coleman provides better sun protection then the SportsBrella XL as it has a greater depth an no pole in the middle More people can fit under it comfortably  The Coleman packs up nice and tight and can fit anywhere the SportsBrellaXL would not have fit in our car minivan was fine going through the middle seats Cons  The Coleman was absolute hell to get setup with moderate winds coming off the Pacific and its flexible frame made it constantly move and bend in the wind In contrast the SportsBrellaXL was very easy to setup  Likewise the Coleman was hell to tear down and packup with the wind where as the SportsBrella was one button press  I originally though the floor of the Coleman would be a benefit but honestly with small kids within 30 minutes the whole inside was filled with sand 
Our set arrived badly dented and chipped Wish I could just keep the cutlery I dont think well exchange it for another It appears to chip too easily So if you are roughing it I doubt this would fit the bill 
Ive camped for about 10 years but never had a plate set Since Im starting to take my toddler and we have a camper I figured the excess wouldnt hurt I love this set Its cute and sturdy Not as nice as GSI but who wants to pays that much anyway 
We cooked out on a camping trip last week and this set is wonderful Clean was very easy Be careful handling the cups with hot coffee 
Its Coleman it works Its inexpensive and yes I suggest that you elevate the nozzle just in case it leaks Other wise love it 
Great product 
Great product multi fuel capable This is its greatest draw At your own risk you can use Odorless Mineral Spirits instead of Kerosene the mantles will last a lot longer Great disaster preparedness tool 
I bought this to use on a recent camping trip and it would not work It was my fault for not testing the item before I went on the trail my bad I had 5 other people with me on this trip all with more camping experience and no one could make it work When I came home I placed another set of mantles on and tried again still nothing The worst part is now Im being told by Amazon that I cannot return this item This information would have been nice to know prior to my purchase seeing that I now have a 8000 paperweight Im very disappointed in this transaction As I search through Amazons pages I cannot even find a customer service email address to ask about this My bottom line is I have to leave a negative review here so hopefully others will learn from my mistake 
I bought this because I wanted the stake puller It was broken after the first use If you set up a tent in your backyard for your kids this would be fine If you camp in the midwest like Illinois Wisconsin Indiana and Michigan areas that have a lot of clay this will be useless The stakes bent going in the clay and the puller bent after the third stake while removing them It would be better to have a cheap claw hammer The broom and dust pan are kind of nice but hammering into clay or rocky soil was difficult with a rubber mallet You would be better off buying a claw hammer and whisk separately Bottom lineGreat for light easy camping in backyards or soft soil but useless in rugged terrain 
This tent kit has the basics The stakes and the mallet are sturdy and the stakes come with rubber tips to keep them from doing any damage when theyre not in use The stake puller is ergonomically shaped and will work well in sandy areas If the stakes are really stuck it will pull out of shape The whisk broom and dust pan are a nice addition however theyre hard to get back in the mesh bag because the strands of the broom get caught in the mesh I agree with Mikes suggestion in his review keep the plastic bag they come in because that will make the process much easier 
This set is of good quality These stakes are the only type we can use for more than a season They do not bend or get lost in the sand The top of the stake does come lose so you have to make sure it is pulled to the top before you put it in the ground The rubber mallet is good quality and fairly heavy The stake puller worked out really well especially in the sand The broom and dust pan was really too small to do much good but was handy for spot cleaning I still have to have my regular size broom to sweep out the tent before folding it I was kind of disappointed with the quality of the broom and dust pan They were just not as hearty as I have come to expect from Coleman I would not say this set is a must have for camping but it does come in handy 
I bought this kit for my husband after our first camping trip and my husband 1 forgot to bring a mallet and broom and dustpan and 2 the stakes that came with our tent all bent the first time we tried to hammer them in Its nice to get it all in one little sack so we dont forget anything I have since decided a large broom and battery operated hand vac suits my taste better than a little broom and dustpan but those are still handy to have around The stakes in this kit are sturdier than the ones that came with our tent ie they dont bend easily The mallet works and we have no problem with it The stake puller works but only if the stakes arent stuck in the ground The last time we used it the stakes wouldnt come out and we were afraid plastic heads on the stakes would come off with the stake puller It would be nice if either the stake heads werent made of plastic or the stake puller would grip stake body so we could get a grip on the stake and pull Other than the problem with removing the stakes I have no complaints 
I bought this item with little to no expectation of real usage Boy was I wrong Out of a hundred dollar purchase on coleman camping gear I think this was one of my best pick The rubber hammer is awesome since you dont have to find rocks to hammer down the anchor and the dustpanbrush combo is excellent and very small so it doesnt consume too much trunk space The anchors are well made and it would definetely last years to come Highly recommended Dont be fooled by the cheap price 
Three poles sets up relatively easy Provides great shade and good space If you plan to use it on the beach I reccommend buying larger plastic tent stakes The ones provided are very thin metal and would not work well in a sandy area Update Beach Use 1 year old son just my wife and I With beach wind the shade went up somewhat easily in 20mins Probably less Id suggest staking it first with the stringed tie downs before you start inserting poles After setting it up we got the little guy in the water After 20 mins in the water we went to the shade Sand go onto his face and it was all over My wife took him to the pool I admitted defeat and drank my beer as I disassembled the shade This is a good buy bc at some point itll be used for more than 20 mins But if you have a child as young as mine and you still intend to buy it get the latger plastic tent stakes and at least six beers 
We recently bought an old 1950 Teardrop Camper and the main color in it is red so the Coleman Dishwear Set was a perfect fit We love it and cant wait to try it out 
Just washed it Bag and all Looks nice we will see how it holds up My wife loves the way it looks and my four year old likes to play bang some with it Just hope he gets over that ASAP Walmart has this with the stove for good price buy stove get this free 
Great product for the price Not overly expensive and solid construction 
Its cheap and works Easier than going to your local sports store Will last a few years unless your kids play with it 
This is really a super product but with one flaw The construction is solid and setup is very quick and easy The lines are a nice added touch and they roll up very easy with the provided handle Net spikes and ropes are strong and secure The one flaw There is no play offout of this net The bottom of the net is so flexible that there is no way you can dig a bad pass out I had to weave a 18 rope thru the bottom netting to get some actual play For beginner use this isnt a big deal For advanced play this system comes up just a bit short 
I got a lot of use out of this net in the first year its very very easy to set up I love the lightweight strong aluminium poles No worries about getting all rusty if I leave it out in the rain The whole product has held up well and I strongly recommend it 
Showed up very fast This cooler is beautiful and all that we hoped for 
Excellent really like the look of this cooler and more important holds ice for 23 days no problem 
Great Fits a lot lot of foodbeer think 48pack beer  a full compliment of hotdogs for 12 people and condiments  ice Ice stayed frozen for 48hrs in 60F and sun Notonlydoesitwork great it also looks good has a lockable latch and is easy to carry Great for car camping picnics or events Not cheaply built or cheap looking either If youre a cooler snob youll definitely get 1 points over the plasticStyrofoam crowd 


buy yourself a mallot and a small dust broompan the stakes work but if you get in something deep youre gonna break the plastic and the stake puller bent Im keeping the mallot and the dust pan trashing everything else And the mesh bag gets caught on the brisiles of the broom 
The rubber mallet is worth it but you can get them for 2 at wally world The stakes really arent that great try these if you are really looking for good stakesa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefMSRGroundHogStakeKitdpB000A8C67WrefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTF8MSR Ground Hog Stake Kita The stake puller is a joke a simple eye hook on the bottom of the mallet works better again part of the 2 wally world special The dust pan is also a joke it would take you an hour to dust a 6 person tent For 10 its worth it but if you are after good stakes buy the ones above if you want a good mallet go to wally world and if you want a good dustpan go to the grocery store 
I used everything in this kit on my last camping trip Hammer just right for spikes spike puller A MUST dirt pan and brush very handy  extra spikes good to have Plus I kept alot of my other spikes in pouch 
I am pleased with this lantern It is well made and so far has handled light regular use The material is quality and it does the job well 
Ive owned a few different types of lamps over the years and the the Colman Duel Fuel has personalty been the best for my use in camping and fishing I really like that the replacement parts are easy to find I wouldnt recommend it for overnight kayaking because of the size of the lamp and space limitations in a kayak I havent had any issues with the case not staying shut like in other reviews Then again them people prob run around with their shoes untied too Just make sure it is latched before you pick it up and take off I carry mine in a backpack when walking to remote fishing holes A normal sized back pack will carry the lantern funnel and a 1 quart fuel container with a little room to spare This lantern uses the Colman 21 Mantels and are included but to save on shipping I would recommend ordering replacements together 
This is a solid little lantern It puts out plenty of light and is well constructed although its a little smaller than I expected The dual fuel feature is a big plus One item on my wishlist is thenbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefColeman295A720TReflectorLanterndpB0009PUSTOrefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTF8Coleman 295A720T Reflector Lanternanbspto help redirect the light Initially I thought the plastic carrying case was unnecessary since the lantern comes in a good box for storage However after our first weekend of using it we had some rain The box would have been ruined The downside to the plastic case is that you cant put the lantern in it while its still hot After it was time for bed I had to wait for it to cool down in the rain before I put it in its case A vented metal case would be much better As far as the complaints about the case not latching properly I can see why it could be an issue You have to carefully snap the hooks completely in place or the bottom may fall out This wasnt an issue for me I can see the snaps wearing out after some use though and maybe some of the case come with bad latches If you are looking for a good lantern this may be it 9282013 update This lantern is still working great after three years of use It has been banged around and dropped on accident at least once It is still working great Even the case with its cheap plastic latches havent worn down yet I like it enough that when I thought I had lost it I replaced it with the same model 
The net is too long and good thing I bought a volleyball because the one that came with this setup would not inflatesince most volleyballs run about 15 I dont believe this should cost so much 
We worried that it would not stay set up very well and stay but we set it up and left it for weeks and never fell down A pretty good set we are very happy with it 
This set of Dining kit is OK For packing on a trail this is what I would use For use in a camping site that you dont have to pack into I find there are some drawbacks to this set The first fault is that I dropped one of the cups from two feet onto my kitchen floor while washing them in preparation to their first use The enamel on the cup chipped in two different places on the outside and also chipped on the inside I have drop pen other enamel products before but at two feet I have nervier had one chip so easily or as much Using the kit in a campground situation the kit cups do not retain heat very efficiently The knives are nice and sharp They will cut steak very nicely The spoons and forks are also good 
I bought to go camping with Due to some illness I have been having I am unable to make any commit 
I enjoyed the shade and privacy that this tent provided My only complaint is that it took took to long to put together and take apart You definitely need two ppl to put this together  if youre on a windy beach 
Man this thing kept my eggs cool and intact 
I love this cooler Love the design love that the handles are sturdy Love the drain has a bit of a gully in the bottom of the cooler to help direct the water out 
Not a bad deal if you get it as a combo with a tent Stakes are sturdy rest of tools are fair quality 
Good value for the money Ive used it on every camping trip since Ive gotten it The dust pan combo is a bit cheap but what do you expect Add up the costs for each piece and youre definitely getting your moneys worthall together in a mesh bag PS Keep the duster set in the plastic bag it came in so the bristles wont push through the mesh and the plastic nubbies on the stakes for the same reason 
Lets face it  when camping there are two categories of gear necessities and other stuff that may be helpful This package from Coleman consisting of 1 a small broom and dustpan 2 four aluminum stakes 3 a rubberheaded mallet and 4 a stake remover definitely falls in the second category 1 Broom and dustpan  small plastic and green this just might get the most use out of anything in the package Not much to say here  it does its job Save the plastic wrapper this comes in because its hard to get the broom back into the mesh bag without it 2 Four aluminum stakes  these are actually pretty good The stakes are much longer and sturdier than the ones that came with my tent They are essentially giant nails with a green plastic head attached for the line to tie onto I would worry about cracking the heads if they got too cold 3 Rubberheaded mallet  much more substantial than you might think good heft to this and it will do its job and any others that might call for a similar tool A bit heavy if anything 4 Stake remover  Cheap bends out of shape All of this comes packed in a little mesh bag The bag is not really big enough for all of this stuff nor is it really sturdy enough to put up with any amount of abuse and the stakes punch right through the bottom Bottom line  you can camp a thousand times without having this set and you would never miss it but its always nice to have extra stakes and a way to clean your tent floor For the price its not a bad set to have 
The rubber mallet and stakes are good They both worked more than adequately even in the rocky ground where first used Remainder of the items are really not worth the price Broompan are really small and cheap plastic Stake puller may be OK in softer ground but easily bent the first time it was used pulling stakes Should say though that stakes were driven in pretty rocky ground and rather hard to pull so puller may work OK in softer ground Overall item is probably overpriced for what you get 
Got this for the Girl Scout Jamboree While it should work wonderfully my water never got hot Although a warm shower was better than a cold one It is VERY difficult to lift above my head when full though 
Works very well No leaks Being able to shut off the water at the business end of the hose is a useful feature 
Works great I was the cleanest dirty hippy at the music festival 
Simple outdoor gear Not for hiking but if you pack your car with a lot of stuff and head out doors a lot this is great car camping gear 
Cheers up any camping moment reminds me of when we camped as kids with our parents everything was enamelware then The family loved it too Would recommend wish they had the coffee pot to match though 
I bought these from either Walmart or Kmart separately Dishes They are actually pretty decent but I have not been careful with them and now they are chipping I suggest getting a bag for them  or one of those fabric coolers on wheels which is what I opted for The best way to care for them besides not throwing them around or dropping them is to make sure they are packed tightly and separate each piece with paper towel The edges are a bit sharp but nothing Ive cut myself on Like any dishware they scratch and chip if you are not careful This dishware is strong and sturdy but once scratchedchipped beware of rust Also hot foods will heat the dishes and can burn you Common sense but worth mentioning Silverware These are ok and worth having if youre sick of wasting money and plastic on throwaway utensils Heres what I think is important when cleaning be aware of any food stuck on the inside of the fork tines and the knife serrations Also clean the area where the metal meets the handle I dont have a problem but I can see how food could build up there if you are not careful Again common sense The knives are actually very useful  I can cut steak with them That also means they can scratch the dishes I threw the carrying case into the washer and dryer and it might have tried to shrink a little but everything still fits inside perfectly All said and done I still think these are worth buying  if you take care of them 
Love this sunshade Gives almost instant protection from the sun Easy to set up and take down 
Great for a day in the beach stroll It was very useful and it was spacious enough for me and my two kids Great shade cover and fairly easy to assemble 
Great kit for the price Remember its Enamelware the color can chip however they will last a very long time before they need to be replaced For the price I am very happy with the kit and it includes everything you may need Coleman does well anyway I would highly recommend 
Beautiful set for the money A few imperfections but nothing that would cause me to return it At approximately 1 per piece how can you go wrong I ran the set through the dishwasher and it came out just fine A real bargain compared to other sets I priced 
Good quality for the price here from Coleman a few rough edges on the cups but overall not bad needs a casecontainersfor plates and cups since they just move around 
Easy to pack In quality wise it lost 1 star There was some scratch and a bit annoying imperfection but acceptable for outdoor use anyway 
This is a nice beach shade once it is up but just be aware that setup is slightly confusing and involved There are three separate tent poles and the sleeves you need to slide them into arent very well designed  theyre a mesh material which sort of binds on the poles whereas a solid nylon fabric would have allowed the poles to slide more easily I would also skip using the stakes  theyre terribly cheap and bendable and any sort of rock or resistance will stop them in their tracks Just weigh it down with the included sandbags by placing them inside the tent or just use your beach gear to weigh it down Once it is up and stably in place its a nice beach shade  very roomy widthwise and heightwise with a huge front door that doubles as an extended floor Blocked the sun well too The welldesigned back door is important for air flow It seems wellconstructed overall You may never get it back into its original bag ever again by the way This is a common problem with tents but this one is really bad  especially considering youll be trying to fold it up on a sometimes windy beach Id just get a separate tote bag and shove it inside that instead Overall recommended Just realize this is NOT a simple popup shade and will take some time to construct 
This arrived last week so we havent put it to its paces at the beach yet but I did want to note a couple of things First this was fairly simple to put together but it took a bit of tugging to get the poles threaded on the first try We liked that it can close up if anyone needs to change and we could let someone lay down inside if they needed a break from the sun I also like that there is a screen at the back so we can get a breeze going without losing all of the shade Its low inside  no standing up and it would definitely be a better shade for beach height chairs than regular chairs I found it somewhat tricky to get small enough to get back into the carrying bag even following the directions I was able to ultimately get it zipped into the bag but it took a bit of wrestling I will probably not bother putting it back into the bag while were packing up at the beach but will shake it out when we get back home and then put it away All in all I feel like this was a good purchase for the money 
If youre a fan of the old school look steel belted coolerget this cooler Took me back to my childhood when I saw it In Florida at the beach in 90 degree weather it held ice just as well as a Yeti that was also in our group mic dropenough said 
The coleman set is great    it is exactly as described I did already have a brand new silverwear set so I jumped right back on and recooped 20 out of that Thanks whoever bought the silverware set 
I keep mine full and hanging in the greenhouse in case water supply is ever interrupted I drain and refill every other month to keep it fresh Peace of mind worth the cost tip little red shower plug looks like it might come loose at some point so I flip it up and secure over a bent nail to keep pressure off of it and make sure I dont find an empty bag when I need it 
A 
Sturdy and effective 
This is very necessary for Volleyball I bought one for each Volleyball set Easily works for both a large full size Court or for a smaller size court with fewer players 
No secondary rings to easily adjust for a 2s court but it works with added sand plates not the stakes it comes with 
This is one the best purchases I ever made in my life simply because a I love beach volleyball b I throw a get together every weekend of the summer in Cali with my friends using this Easy to install but a TIP it requires more than one person 2 is enough 4 is a plus 
We keep this in the hall closet for those times the power goes out The kids and operate it as well as the adults and it put off a great amount of light Takes Batteries 
Good for inside the tent This lantern has taken a beating and still works 
These were really nice For me they evoke the feel of outdoorsy western roughing it The pouch for the silverware works well It would be nice if there was some sort of similar pouch or carrying case for the plates bowls and spoons I had an old laptop bag that ended up working out ok but there must be some better way to bundle all of this up together Im always surprised that my 12 cup coffee maker seems to run out after about four cups of coffee The cups in this kit are quite a bit closer to one cup in volume so they are likely to be smaller than you are used to Still they are good and sturdy as are the bowls and plates and Im really glad I got these If you prefer paper plates or hate washing dishes after each meal skip this However if you like eating on a plate that wont collapse and dump your food in your lap or if you like knowing you can cut up your steak without snapping your plastic knife and fork in half then this is a kit that is worth your money 
These are great dishes to have as they serve as both dishes and serving utensilsdishes in a pinch Be warned you must store and handle these items with care by wrapping them in paper when not in use as they chip easily Still they are cheaper than any in store deal I have seen 
Got a steal of a deal on this bad boy Works great and I love the vintage look It is almost an exact replica of my dads cooler from back in the 70swhich I still have 
I sent it back as I wanted one that was electric 
Awesome cooler This is a very well made product 
These have NO valve or clickpinch shutoff there is no easy way to keep the water in until its warm enough for a shower Dont waste your money Seriously 
good outdoor shower 
Amazon shipped us a defective product We got the tent for a beach trip on the east coast and had it shipped to our destination When we opened it up everything looked fine  packaging was intact etc However when we went to assemble the shock cord for one of the black poles was broken already We tried to restring it but couldnt feed enough of it through the pole to grab on the other end So we made do and assembled the pole without the string to keep it together Not a big deal but annoying on a brand new purchase The tent worked great once it was up however when we disassembled it the shock cord on the other black pole snapped In case youre wondering I have been a backpacker for 20 years so no user error here  my best guess is that this thing had been sitting in a warehouse too long and the elastic had dryrotted or was just defective Anyway the next day when I was assembling it again the gray pole which is the larger of the 3 poles and handles the arch for the opening one of the pole segments split lengthwise down the middle I got a nice fiberglass splinter out of it too At that point with the black poles not staying together on account of the broken shock cord and the main support losing an entire pole in the middle I gave up on this POS I wrapped it all up and put it in the garbage can on the boardwalk Unfortunately Amazon wont give me a refund since I cant send it back but I wasnt about to waste another 30 minutes of my time trying to repack this useless substandard product Coleman is usually pretty dependable but this one was a total waste of money 
This beach shelter is freakin awesome Super easy to set up and take down it made our beach trip so much more comfy We saw several other people using it as well so you know its great I loaned it to a friend for their vacation and they went out and bought their own Good stuff 
We got this for our upcoming trip to Hawaii We tested at the local beach and it did very well despite moderate winds We only used the sand bags and didnt have to use the lead lines Assembly was very easy with two people If you have put a tent together then this will be very familiar Only thing I am worried about is that the material is thin Not sure if I would want to put a chair on it However it is acceptable since we need it to be lightweight for our luggage 
nice product but the wife  kids wont setup without me 
Nice easy to put together fairly large easily opens and closes and my kids love it I havent used it at the beach yet 
Christmas present for hubby he saw the box at the door when we got home so he got it early Loves it 
Bought for my Church works fine 
Could not last 6 months piece of junk buy a two inch line not this garbage 
These do not come premeasured One time at the beach a nice gentleman had a very long measuring tape which he used to measure out the exact lengths of a beach volleyball court and then we marked the center of the sidelines so we could easily set it up next time Usually the buckles mark the center but not on these lines Another thing is that unless you get some sort of spool these will tangle like crazy and its pretty annoying They were cheap though which is why I got them In hindsight Id rather pay a little more for nicer lines If you are trying to play with an official size court I would recommend another set of lines unless you plan on measuring these yourself 
yes great lines a little lighter weight than anticipated but great for easy transport I use them all the time 
They arent glass so they wont break and they are very nice to look at They clean up nicely and pack away so easy I am very glad I invested in this for our camping trips 
The enamel is splotchy and the silverware is cheap The set will work fine for camping put it lacks the quality that you would expect from Coleman 
Very bright and unlike the new LED versions you can look at it without going blind as the light is spread out over several inches and not just a point source Large too acts very much like a good old fashion gas lamp 
awesome lantern very heavy when batteries are in it 
One of the support poles broke on first use 
Used this in Zion and had hot showers every night I have used the solar shower while backpacking as well Lightweight and good quality 
I bought this coleman shower bag like new But it came damaged and had pin hole leaks Im very disappointed Want me to take day off from work to send it back It was under 10 dollars 
Great product Fast delivery 
The classic camp shower it definitely gets the job done I think the heating time is based off direct complete sun with no wind as wind seems to also make it take longer but it does warm up Almost no way to rinse it out well or clean it so a smell build up while storing it What I have found helps is when you first use it if you have a water source fill and drain water from it a few times before filling to hang Speaking of hanging I felt I had to reinforce the handle it hangs from with gorilla tape and I still dont feel comfortable putting a full 5 gallons in it but who knows it might have held up Maybe I am just paranoid as its stretching and straining 
Two packs of block ice lasted for 7 days until it was completely gone Drained the cooler once per day Mix of being in the car and outside in temps from 5070 Fantastic cooler Great alternative to the Yeti if you want a good camping cooler Pro tip Buy two blocks of ice put them in a cooler Next line the inside of the cooler with a black garbage bag Now line it with a second one The ice should be sitting below the garbage bags outside of them Place your food inside the garbage bags That will keep your food from getting wet You will need to change the garbage bags after 3 days or so due to condensation from the food packaging and what not But the melting ice will not get the food wet 
This is a very heavy duty cooler It will last FOREVER Very well made Only FLAW is it doesnt come with a food trayMost coolers this expensive have one Also Coleman doesnt make one as a accessory Im off to the 99c store for a size that will fit Love the stainless steel 
this seriously is a great cooler i have had ice in it since monday i am prepping a turkey for thanksgiving and put 6 bags of ice in monday night and they are still 45 bags of ice left great room and the handles with the rubber is so nice on the hands it seals so perfectly and keeps every cool on the insice the bottle opener is nice to have but the drain is great so you dont have to tip it to get water out i even had this outside when it was 10 outside with water in it and nothing on the inside froze that is how good this is this is the best cooler i have owned and it is not close 
Lamp is bright and built well An excellent item to have when the lights go out Be prepared for those emergency situations Of course ideal for indoor use 
WORKS WELL  GIVES OFF GREAT LIGHT LAST LONG GREAT PRICE 
GREAT LANTERN 
works great  but takes lots of batteries 
Put brand new batteries in lantern Did not work Thought maybe I might have been made in foreign country and their plus and minus signs were backward so turned batteries around Did not work Returned lantern 
We have plenty of Coleman items and this is great Fairly easy to assemble and disassemble Fairly similar to a tent where you connect the bars together Nice and big on the inside Im 53 and its great for me to change clothes in when we are camping because it zips up 
nice 
Wanted a dedicated set for the camper and they have worked out ok Already a couple of chips on the plates but I can live with it 
When I received the set one of the cups was gouged and had chips in the paint all around the rim where you would drink The box the set came in was busted open yet still placed into a box to ship and sent to me I know it wasnt damaged during shipping because that box was perfectly fine Will be working on hopefully exchanging this item 
Very poor enamel finish and the utensils are plastic not enamel like the GSI brand Had to send back expect more from a Coleman item Amazon refunded the items so that made the experience easy on the wallet 
This is a beautiful set I bought them for camping as I want something unbreakable and easy to care for Same quality as my Grandmas set was when I was a kid 
I purchased these for my travel trailer They are a little light but hopefully will hold up They were inexpensive which is good for camping Not a big loss if they get torn up 
Hot Hot hot 
This works well for 2s size court or regular full size courts I recommend buying some extra stacks as these ones will break if you are not careful or using it on hard ground etc Otherwise this works great 
The quality of the product is really great At first I was unsure but took a chance and was greatly pleased 
The quality of the product is really great At first I was unsure but took a chance and was greatly pleased 
Intimidating to put together but worth the investment for a great day at the beachpark 5 minute set up 
I was back and forth between a shady tent or a giant umbrella I couldnt be happier that I went with this choice It takes a few minutes to set up Im sure Itll faster as time goes by The quality is definitely Coleman We took this to the beach on a very sunny but windy day The set up was a challenge as the wind kept us on our toes The anchors were useless with so much wind but we had coolers and bags that we used to weigh everything down We spent most of the day half in and half out playing card games reading books and enjoying the beach It was perfect for 2 adults and a 9 year old But I did spend some time people watching What I saw made me love our shady tent more I watched as people clung to their umbrellas as they tipped and flopped I watched as peoples towels were blown over and hat flying off in a swoop And I watched as people tried to eat without getting a gust of sand to add to their snacks Without the sides to protect us from the wind we wouldve taken part in that mess Instead we just got to kick back and enjoy the day The size is way smaller and lighter than an umbrella with a good anchor would be AND it actually fits back in the bag feel like that never happens The cost of this little guy is totally worth it We plan to bring it on our next camping trip and our 9 year old wants to sleep in it so we may just set it up in her room one day  AND it actually fits back in the bag feel like that never happens 
Fits in our motor home bins below Keeps the drinks very cold dont let anyone sit on it it squishes the gasket and ruins the seal we learned the hard way everyone wants to sit on it when it is out of the bin these are not chairs people 
This is a very cool looking cooler It was just the right size for a weekend camping trip for me and my three kids It was not too warm 60s at highest but I really didnt have much ice to add and it all stayed cool for 3 days Couldnt ask for more I am sure it would do well in summer with lots of ice The handles and latch all seem very sturdy and it has a drain plug which is nice 
I like it a lot Love the drain And at 13 the price of a Yeti Oh yeah 
THE BEST COOLER GOING WORKS GREAT AND HAVE SILVER ONE TWO YEARS OLD AND STILL WORKS GREAT THIS IS THE CATS MENOW 
Quality built and looks good 
runs out of battery after only 3 days of use and its rather big and clunky for a device that doesnt produce that much light 
Enamel looks good great color wont be hrd to find if misplaced while cmping Great deal carrying case for the knives forks and spoons is made of a nice thick denim material with a nicely stiched set ot ties 
I wasnt sure that I would find any use for this dining kit but wanted something in Tanzania to take on picnics to wonderful spots So got this set The only thing I wish was that they had a cute container of some sort but the flatwear is in a cute windup case so no losses there But the rest of the kit is really nice It wont break it cleans easily you can see it in the grass and dirt and everything is a good size Just the ticket for picnics Coleman definitely knows what they are doing Now they need to make it with a traveling case for the whole thing 
Usually we tend to just throw all of the unmatched dishes into our camping gear This time I wanted to be able to set a nice table and also Im tired of marking our last name on everything 
Id love to find a dining kit that looks just like this one but is made somewhere other than China USA maybe and that has an enamel coating that doesnt selfdestruct Over the course of two count em 2 camping trips the enamel on all bowls and mugs developed chips and began peeling The flatware didnt come apart but is made of cheap bendy metal so you have to be careful not to break it I ended up with a functional useful flatware pouch bendy flatware and some plates for the cost of the Dining Kit Im sure someone out there would consider that a good deal but I do not 
Like it but I wish it wasnt so floppy 
nice shower for the  good to have on hand if power goes out 
Everything fine 
Very efficient thankyou 
Absolutely Fabulous Great Safe Product 
Im impressed I have a Coleman extreme 5 day cooler and side by side on a camping trip this cooler was holding ice as good as that one and looks 100xs better So glad I finally ordered it For the 54 qt size this is my preferred chest 
We purchased this Coleman Beach Shade tent last year and have used it about three times now So far it has held up to our use pretty well It can be a little tricky to put up and will probably be aggravating for you the first time you set it up I suggest practicing before you go to the beach After becoming familiar with it I can put it up by myself in about 10 minutes It helps to have an extra hand at the beach especially because it is more windy there When we purchased ours and set it up the first time we noticed two small holes in the side of it I used some seam tape on the holes to help it from tearing or opening up more and that did the trick for us Its pretty roomy and a bit bigger than most of the instant shelters that I have seen The front can be zipped up and there is a back window that can also be covered I wanted this one mostly because of those features as it would allow for us to change clothes inside and not have to use the dirty public rest rooms that are at the beach It can get hot inside especially when the back window is closed but with the front and back open it provides good wind flow through the tent There are netted pockets in the corners of the tent and it comes with small sandbags to assist in holding it down Directions for putting the tent up can be found sewn to the inside of the tent bag and they are pretty easy to follow The tent also has guy lines and stakes included Overall we are pretty pleased with it but it does take a little longer to put up than some of the instant shade shelters Its roomy provides good UV protection and we like that we can use it to change clothes inside 
It is very easy to set up but the longer pole can be a little bit of a pain in the butt the first few times youre breaking it in The entire thing is light weight and easily moved around to avoid the sun after you set it up We havent used it in the sand yet but I imagine we will need to weight it down with a cooler and a few other items if it is even remotely windy Very happy with the purchase Update 81216 We bought this for our beach trip 730168916 The first day we used it on the beach it broke while being taken down Every single eyelet fell right out of the thing Ive never been so mad about an item before As long as it was up it was just fine but a little sand apparently makes the thing self destruct I wanted a replacement but apparently there is only a 1 month and 8 day warranty on this item as my ability to replacereturn ended on 84 while we were still 1000 miles from home 
works as expected 
Its big but we had an older gas Coleman lantern and put this next to it and did a bit of a comparison This is brighter by far and casts a wider net of light I would say that there is no discernible difference between the bright and normal setting at all I couldnt tell even on a night with a new moon This thing is big huge in fact compared to a gas lantern The good thing is this doesnt get hot like a gas lantern does It seems rugged and took a couple of spills with no effect as my young boys carried it around I would prefer something smaller and took a star off for the size and the fact that the two settings seem to be the same 
I returned this I am giving this product 1 star because I liked the silverware that came with it I was really disappointed in the enamel ware On several pieces after a single use the enamel popped off and the bare metal was exposed This shouldnt happen Coleman needs to look at the source that is making these in China and maybe think about bringing them back to the USA I would gladly pay double for these if they were as good as they used to be 
I purchased from Amazon warehouse and it was repackaged so my expectations werent super high But the description said it was repackaged but in brand new condition Well it wasnt Two of the plates had decent sized chips in the enamel and one of the bowls did also That said it functions well and the price wasnt bad 
Nice set Well made and easy to clean If you like extremely hot beverages be careful The cups are not insulated at all and you will get burned This might be a good thing when it is extremely cold outside as they will definitely keep your hands warm 
The glazing is not up to par On about half of the pieces the red glazing is smeared during the manufacturing process and there are blobs of what I think to be clear top coat glazing pooled at the bottom of some of the dishes The problem with glazing deficiencies on enamelware is ultimately youre looking at rust and then surrounding glazing begins to crack away due to the rust spreading underneath the glazing The flatware will also rust if not dried in the dishwasher applied heat Well see how the plastic handles hold up to the high heat of the dishwasher  they might melt Theyre yet another outsourced product from a company that once WAS past tense a quality manufacturer I wonder what Colemans executive management would think if I catered some food and served them dinner on these substandard dishes  
This is AMAZING this was used while camping the water stayed warm and worked like a charm We hookedit comes with S hook and rope it to the center of tent 
Works pretty good as a foot washer when getting out of pond 
didnt work as I thought 5hrs in hot sun luke warn hose was kinked spicket leaks 
On a sunny day it will give you a hot shower just remember at 8 lbs to the gallon it will be heavy Get help to hang it or use a pulley 
This product is SO DISAPPOINTING To begin with It is large and the directions say that it is supposed to be laid on a clean surfaceI NEED IT FOR THE BEACHTHUS THE NAME BEACH SHADE HOWEVER THERE IS NO CLEAN SURFACE TO LAY THIS LARGE THING ON Not to mention IT IS EXTREMELY CON FUSING HOW TO PUT THE LARGE POLES IN THE RIGHT PLACES THE DIRECTIONS ARE CONFUSING I DO NOT WANT TO TAKE THIS TO THE BEACH OR ANYWHERE FOR THAT MATTERAS I WILL TAKE UP A GOOD PART OF MY DAY TRYING TO SET THIS UP AND TRYING TO FIND A CLEAN PLACE TO SET IT UP ON 
nice vintage lookthere is a little play in the lid as it sealswas concerned at first but was pleasantly surprised to wake up the next morning with almost all of the ice still intactoverall happy 
They love itworks great 
This will do its job but it is very thin and lightweight i can see it breaking down by the sunlight and falling apart in short time even the rings at the corners are very tiny but big enough to do their job So many times i buy something from a pic and when I get it I hold it in my hand and say what a piece of crap Remember the old adage you get what you pay for 
These lines are perfect and my crew loves to use them However storage is a problem They should provide a case of wrap around divice made for theses wedding lines 
Two people required for setup I would say over 15 knot winds you will need significant amounts of weight to keep it from blowing away 
its a pain to set up best with two people one can do it have to be patient and careful like all tents the 12 dome concept provides privacy its got decent height I can almost stand up in it its easy to move around and easy to clean has nice ventilation with the big zip window I bought it to sunbath at home to add privacy does the job nicely can be used as a storage tent or would be nice on the beach one person could sleep in it or two small kids fun tent for kids to play in 
What a let down Realistically used this very minimal due to it being for emergency use only I put my faith in you Coleman and you let me down Unit barley fell on the floor and the bottom where you add batteries could not be accessed after making it useless If the huge amount of D batteries wasnt bad enough then this put it over the top 
good 
Lights up a room Fantastic tool to have during a power outage 
daughter liked the lantern worked well for camping 
A 
Product works good but thI stopper leaks a little 
I wasnt real impressed as there is not a shut off valve so you have to rig up a way to keep the spicket up or the water will just drain out 
We took this camping on a week long camping trip So handy to have everything neatly in one box with the cute little wrap up tote for silverware Plates were sturdy easy to clean and attractive too Previously we had a mish mash of odds and ends thrown in a bin but we loved having this be so compact and organized Great addition to our camping supplies 
Just received this set The enamel was severely chipped even though it had been packaged very well If the enamel of this product cracks this easily I dont want it around my familys food 
I think for adults this is an awesome set My kids have trouble with it The metal dishes get very hot from hot food which I hadnt considered before buying In retrospect plastic would have been better for them Also the spoons are large and somewhat shallow  my kids found it nearly impossible to eat cereal with them Again for adults it would be perfectly fine 
Yes I agree with another reviewer that the mugs take up space but I toss them in the drinks cooler so I dont really care The set is 4 cups 4 bowls 4 plates and cutlery in a holder Someone said bacteria could grow on the cutlery set well I dont know about you but bacteria can grow pretty much anywhere especially while camping which is why we wash stuff and then put it into a clean storage area away from other items and especially away from food items and water  rain I think its a great quality set  maybe some people are getting flawed items or possible even items damaged in transit etc but mine is damage free and will do very nicely for camping I expect it to last a really long time too Only thing I will say is wow its noisy when my 5 year old decides it will make a superb drum set  ugh 
The quality isnt great I had to return the first one and the second one they sent me has bubbles in the finish Too much trouble to return it again 
Love this cooler Retro looks with modern technology The first time we used it was in AugustIn Louisiana We left it outside for 4 days and used it opening and closing the entire time It still had ice and was still cold Did I mention this was AugustIn Louisiana Very nice cooler A true Coleman 
Arrived with a dent on top of the cooler The cooler is metal on the exterior so its very susceptible to dents Return process was easy but we were unable to use it for our camping trip the week we purchased Better off going to a store to get this 
Water didnt get as warm as I thought it would compared to the water temp in the lake it was the same 
Would rather spend my money on a metal framed canopy This is ok but doesnt tolerate the wind very well even with all the stakes 
This Dining kit was of decent quality worked just like plates cups and forks should Coleman has always been good too bad its all from China now Americans cant make cups and forks anymore I guess all of our fingers are too fat to do any real work 
Coleman is a name to reckon with WC Coleman is the last word in camping and outdoor recreational products They have a long tradition of quality innovation and variety Hands down they make nothing less than quality products This Coleman Enamelware Dining Kit is no exception It comes with four Speckled Enamelware 10inch dinner plates four 10ounce mugs and four 6inch bowls It also includes 4 knives 4 spoons and 4 forks and unobtrusive carrying case This is a heavy duty set in more ways than one 
In concept it is a great set for a family of four Unfortunately the coating was chipping off some of the platescups Returning for refund 
It broke after two months 
What a great lantern Nice and big worked great illuminating our camp area Has a low and high setting that saves your eyes in the dark It is plastic but it is well made It is rather large but perfect for car camping 
Great inexpensive lantern Very bright on high setting Made of a light plastic so it is easy to carry Top carryinghanging handle is great 
Used it worked great It does require a lot of batteries so am curious how long it will last The handle is very durable light is very bright Camping in the middle of the night this was all we needed 
I didnt buy mine on Amazon but have had one for around 4 years Mine is all stainless steel which gets hot but somehow keeps ice for days I have a Coleman 120 quart that advertises keeps ice for 6 days Not even close After 3 days all the ice was melted in the 120 quart and steel one still had ice The big disappoint for me is my latch is steel but the hook is plastic After a few uses I could open the lid without turning the latch open Important for float trips if you turn the canoe over All my stuff in the cooler fell out into the river I hate plastic parts on pieces that get used repeatedly 
What a disappointment I love the retro looks of this cooler I bought it to replace a 1970s Thermos cooler I loved and used for decades It looks like a quality product The problem It doesnt keep things cool It is probably fine to bring to a picnic for an afternoon but forget camping Ice melts within an hour I dont even think it would hold up to a day at the beach Unfortunately I purchased it in June and didnt use it until just this past Labor Day Weekendtoo late to return it otherwise it would definitely be going back 
Well what can you say it is a cooler it worked for the 2 days I needed it to and was a large enough capacity for me I guess the issue will always be the Quarts these things hold versus the weight they are when full This one was a good weight for volume for me to easily lift full into the car 
Very handy to just throw this thing on the ground stretch it out and stake it down Saves a bunch of time pacing out areas and messing with ropes Extra wide stripe is solid and looks sharp Only problem is that the first time I used one of the corners had the stitching pull out immediately Looked like it had one or two stitches May have just been a fluke but a bit disappointing and caused some frantic moments trying to fix it while a group of people waited Easily fixed but shouldnt have to Without the seem burst this would get a 5 
I bought these so I could have a set of short lines for my outdoor volleyball net they work fine but there are a few things to note They arent marked so you will need to measure them out and mark them so you can adjust them to the right length Also the way they are designed the center buckle is not going to be under the net as a reference when you shorten them for tandem play Like I said they work but know what you have to do and what you have to deal with Premeasuring isnt such a big deal to me but the fact that the buckle is not under the net is a problem It is just annoying that it is not centered to make laying the lines and referencing easy the real problem is the buckle is now in the area of play So you can step on it Also the extra strap is just left to dangle about when you adjust the lines More expensive 2 prolines dont have these quirks I plan on buying a set of the more expensive 2 lines and just keeping these as a backup for myself I should have spent the extra 20 or so dollars for the better setup since I play all the time 
good webbing adjustable and easy to use if you play beach volley ball this is what you need spikes are a bit flimsy but cie la vie 
Used this on the river this year and it worked great Warms up quick on a hot day in the sun and when not in use it rolls up and stows away 
I have been using these for years They are a life saver when facilities are not available Taking a hot shower in the middle of the wilderness after a hot 12 mile hike is heaven Works good island camping on a boat or practically anywhere 
I like it 
Does not work good Water barely comes out disappointed since it is a Coleman brand 
Thanks works ok 

Great lantern in the low setting it really illuminates 
I like it if you are camping as small group It was sufficient for a group of 4 For a larger group just having one of these will not suffice 
This lamp works amazing and the price was what roped us in we needed a lamp for camping and all the big named stores sold them for twice the amount 
we had a power frailer and needed it we used it for several hours and never worried about tripping on anything everyone should have at least on easy to carry so you can see what around you 
These days were mostly car camping to get our toddler acclimated to the outdoor and sleeping in a tent And this is a perfect car camping cooler It holds what we need and keeps everything cool  while also doubling as a nice prep area for mealtime And its a much better deal than than certain other coolers that are all about brand name over function 
Excellent quality very durable plastic base with steel shell keeps contents cold for 34 days max without restocking the ice 
I so loved the looks of this It works well ice lasted a lot longer then the plastic coolers They had heads turning when we drove by on back of flat bed It was a perfect match for me 
My wife and I now do a lot of civilized car camping I have spent a lifetime mountaineeringadventure hiking and using everything from tin cans and up to cook in and eat out of This item caught my eye and I had to have it Received item quickly and it is very very nice Heavy gauge excellent finish and very attractive Can now retire all our mismatched plates cups  flatware and have a nice tidy set of matched dishes These will look pretty sharp on our camp dining table 
Let me say that the only reason that I gave this product 2 stars was because the cups and bowls are Ok Everything seemed to be well made The plates looked really good until I looked a little closer Three of them have chips around the edges I really expected better quality from Coleman I would return them but I am so tired of businesses selling junk I mean who inspects these things before they are sold to a customer Update I now understand why the quality of this product is so poor I was under the impression that all Coleman products were American Made When I went to wash this set to put it with the other camping equipment I found on the bottom of each piece a sticker that said Made in China Dont get me wrong I am not prejudice in any way It is just that now I understand why Colemans quality has gotten so poor 
Ill come back and provide an update once I put these to a practical test next month on a camping trip But contrary to many reviews my shipment arrived in perfect condition and looks to be pretty darn good quality for the money The spoons are not particularly shallow as some have thought I love the sleeve for the flatware and I will hold on to the box to pack the rest in my camping box I have high hopes for how they work out in use Id be surprised if they dont work out very well Edit March 2015 Been using these on 10 camping trips a year going on year 3 and this set is fantastic Still like new No chipping clean up great I store them in a cloth cinch bag in the gear bin 
Ive been camping ever since I was a kid and I remember my family always using Coleman products for these events I had a camping themed Christmas this year because I wanted to stock up on supplies to take my own family to the great outdoors One of the items I asked for was this set of enamel plates from Coleman Upon inspecting them I noticed a lot of enamel paint chips in the bottom of the box Two of the cups have large sections in which the enamel coating is missing This doesnt look like a packaging or shipping defectit looks like poor quality on how they were coated Some of the bowels and plates have runs in the coating as wellbut at least it is covered What surprises me is that all the contents in this box was hand packed It is made in China and it looks like they would at least throw the bad cups out when they were packing them in the box The section in which there is no enamel is pretty darn noticeable Everything else seems fine My box might be a fluke but it was pretty disappointing to see that the quality was not what I expected The runs in the paint coating and the uneven layers make me think that this are not going to last very long The silverware seems to be ok and I like that it comes in a protective pouch to keep it organized These items havent been field tested yet but just on inspecting them by handI think I would of gone with something else 
Worked perfectly 
If this is the same as the one I bought at Target the way that I got it to be comfortable is to blow air into it until it was completely firm then quickly close the valve off It became rigid enough that it didnt give me hard spots However it is over 3 pounds so it is pretty heavy for backpacking 
A little than expected but good 
I dont recommend hanging this bag or using the shower head Its difficult to hang high enough and the nozzle wastes water as you slide it inout to turn the flow onoff a pushbutton would have been better Some brands of these bags have builtin chemical thermometers which change colors to indicate temperature but the way I use this bag it isnt necessary As an easy and cheap way to heat up water this is great Fill and leave in a sunny spot The water can actually get too hot so check it before letting the kids bathe Add cold water until acceptable  cooler than youd want at home in order to allow more people to shower per bag It saves a lot of time and fuel over heating that much cold water on a stove We dispense a third to a half of the heated water into a collapsable bucket and add coldhot water eg from stove to bring it to a comfortable temperature Use a cup to scoop the water for bathing This method not only conserves water allows accurate temperature control but allows you to ration the water It would be difficult to pour boiling water in the bag directly if it wasnt warm enough eg you dont get back to camp until sunset and the water has already cooled somewhat Ive found that using the nozzle one person may consume 34 the bag one big friend used the entire 5 gal By splitting and using a cup 23 adults can thoroughly bathe with 5gal When rationing smaller amounts we tell folks to bring their water bottle cold water with them in case they run out Our family of five is served with a single 5gal bag by adding coldhot water We keep the kettle on while folks are bathing and can all shower one after the other with no waiting for the water to heat on the stove We use a fullsize house kettle not a dinky camping kettle I also own a Zodi shower propane water heater but dont even use it anymore as this simple lowtech method is sufficient faster and packs better For the shower tent the popup style one didnt last we now use one with proper steel poles and its much better albeit large to pack But whenever theres a strong wind the popup wouldnt hold up Also the popup seemed colder because the wind seemed to pass through the flimsy nylon too easily I dont remember what brand we used to have for the popup but heres the shower stall we use now recommendednbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefTexsportInstantPortableOutdoorCampingShowerPrivacyShelterChangingRoomdpB000ITVSSQrefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTF8Texsport Instant Portable Outdoor Camping Shower Privacy Shelter Changing Rooma 
I have a serious issue with a couple of design flaws that a flagrant during use 1st the handle does not support the weight of the water it ripped during normal use we had to Jerry rig it so the handle wouldnt break Simply keeping the plastic internal handle present the whole way through would eliminate that issue The 2nd the hose that this uses gets easily kinked and gravity flow only The hose is extremely cheap The only way to prevent this issue is to have the bag high over your head but 5gallons of water is not exactly light Plus in order to keep water flowing we had to crouch down low so the hose didnt kink which in an outdoor setting is kind of gross I will not purchase again and will just spend the money to get a higher quality product 
Finally had a chance to try out my shower bag by Coleman Place the bag full of water on top of my car in direct sunlight Water was heated in about 2 maybe 3 hours however the water hose constantly leaks water even with the clamp all the way closed You must find a way to position the shower hose above the bag at all times or you will come back to a puddle full of water and an empty bag  Plan to use the bag just as a heating apparatus only and pour the water out for use in a different shower system Conclusion that heats the water well but shower system is subpar 
My parents are getting up in age and no longer want to use the oil lamps they have for when the power goes out too time consuming and the fumes really get to them They asked me to find them lanterns online and we settled on two of these They love them Very bright and long lasting We took one with us camping and it lit up the entire area to set up at night Highly recommended well be buying ourselves a couple for the next trip 
Turned it on the first time and the light was bright for about 1 minute then it dimmed and that was it I was one setting from then ondim Itll be bright initially but just literally for a second then back to dim This was the only absolute failure on my camping trip but I had other light so it didnt hurt anything 
We had 3 separate power outages last year I am so glad I invested in this lantern Will definitely buy another one 
Enough power to light up a good area when camping Darkness comes in quick when you are camping and its important to have a reliable lantern The weight of the batteries keeps it secure and stable 
Very bright lightweight and seems durable However there does not seem to be a discernible difference in brightness between low and hi settings 
We used it during out power outage and it was a life saver The batteries lasted a long time and it is easily portable 
We have not had opportunity to use the shade shelter we will do that during next week vacation but I did inspect and put up it will be perfect for our visit to the beach with our Grandchild Keep her in shade so she can also enjoy the day 
Pole Ring poor weak 
This little mat really makes a difference in terms of comfort Much better than having a foam mat Very Happy with the purchase 
Always work 
Completely different from the photo  much thinner Garbage 
I used this pad for seven days on RAGBRAI bike ride across Iowa and it was convenient and comfortable 
I would say self inflating is subject to interpretation It doesnt inflate much but its good enough for my six and seven year olds just not enough for me Its a pretty thin layer of cushion To inflate it you just unroll it and it takes a few minutes Then you connect the nozzle on top and seal it To roll it back up you undo the nozzle to let the air out The air doesnt really go out by itself You have to kind of press on it as you roll it up The connected straps are convenient to secure it once rolled up Its easy and simple just not as much cushion as Id like I got an air mattress for my husband and I and the kids use these 
So far so good You can really tell that it is steel lined because when you have ice in there it really cools up the outside of it that you can feel to the touch unlike the just plastic chests I even added a sticker to mine to give it a little bit of my style  
Ive been using this set as my everyday dishes I cook in a sun oven so I can warm up my food using this outdoor tableware and not having to worry about breaking a dish or cup I refuse to eat out of plastic dishes anymore and this dining kit solves all my issues I read the reviews about the chipped cups and one of my cups arrived chipped but I decided not to return them because Im sure others will ultimately chip since I use them daily outdoors My set was speckled enamel and not a solid red as reported in one of the previous reviews I love the color and the plates are larger than I expected but the cups are smaller than those blue speckled enamel cups you can buy at WalMart and other camping stores if that matters to anyone If youre concerned about the possibility of any chips I would suggest purchasing them local and inspect the box 
Love this set We take it camping and its so easy to pack We have really enjoyed this product The color red really stands out and it is very durable as well as easy to clean 
we used these for our trip in the mountains No problems not as heavy as i would of liked but they clean easily are nice to look at did not break and the utensils are much better than plastic I am going to buy another set as it was enough for 4 people but having to wash each time we at was not so good 
I always bought plastic utensils Styrofoam cups and paper bowls and plates before getting this set Its perfect for a family of 4 Everything in this set is durable and easy to clean The spoons are big and the knifes work great for butter and cutting steak It will definitely save me money over time 
This product is great Excellent quality and priced perfect Highly recommend this item Silverware is also of good quality Great for camping 
We set this up for a weeklong reunion and have been very pleased with it We prepared metal poles set in concrete in tires and used pulleys and ratchets to tighten up the net Also anchored each side down and used the straps provided to make the net nice and tight This net has been great and appears to be very durable I expect we will use it for years to come 
but get the ratchet for it You wont be able to get it tight enough without it Bought this for a rental property and think itll be good enough to withstand renters 
I have bought two with hopes it was a one offnope It leaks out of the fill hole when you lay it down to warm 
I purchased this bag to use at Bonnaroo this year and it did not disappoint Four days of our campsite using it for not only a shower but a sink to wash hands and dishes and this thing still looks and works like day one The top has a very sturdy handle that makes it easier to hold the bag above your head while hanging it or using temporarily The nozzle lets out a decent amount of water but not too much as to use the water quickly Only one side of it is blacked out the other side is clear so you can see how much water is left 
no complaints worked as it should It was a great lantern to use in the tent as well as navigating back and forth from the fire 
Since it is not safe to use a multifuel or propane lantern inside a tent the question entered my mind what will I do for lighting inside the tent I came across the Coleman battery powered fluorescent lantern It is about the size of a basic lantern and emits plenty of light to function and even to read by It uses eight D size batteries so one might entertain the idea of rechargeable batteries I found the cheap nonrechargeable batteries for about 1 per pair so not so bad So safe relatively inexpensive provides good lighting What more could you reasonably want I would definitely recommend this item 
Weve had this for two years  I like to wait to do reviews until weve had something awhile We use this mostly to walk our dog at night on a country road both to see and as a warning to oncoming cars We also use it to carry out to our woodshed to fill up It really does a nice job and isnt heavy at all It is also sturdy and despite all the use it has held up really well Fortunately we havent had to use it for power outages we live in Maine so I am crossing my fingers Good purchase and happy with it 
We like this unit but it did not work after a couple times of use However we called Coleman and actually talked to a person the first time and he instructed us how to make this unit deactivate which we did and then I emailed a picture of it to him and he replaced the unit immediately Some products do not always work but when you have customer service like Coleman has I will always be a repeat customer with them ans continue to buy their products 
lights up two roomsnice sturdy handle I like that it takes your choice of two different size batteries Cant beat Amazon and Coleman  
This is the second cooler of this model that broke on us midtrip Bought in May and used it only 2 weekends Im in August as I write I would think Coleman could make coolers that last longer than a few months Highly dissatisfied Get a better cooler 
My son put this on his wish list Weve owned one for years  years its looking a bit rough but still works great My son loves his Wish it had wheels 
Should be no stars Cooler arrived with a dent in the lid We decided to ignor it and went camping We put of drinks food and perishables in added 20 ice and latched the top down and I were very surprised that the ice was TOTALLY melted after only 6 hours We had to make daily trips for ice What a camping bummer Might be ok for indoor party cooler but not outside 
Product came damaged had to return Not willing to try again 
Sturdy kept our food cold for days with ice replenishment It works much better than a plastic cooler Very happy with the product 
Finally a cooler that holds ICE It lasted 3 days with ICE Perfect 
I bought these on Amazon and used them this past weekend during a camping trip They held up well The knives cut thick steaks with no problem and the plates didnt scratch The coffee cups worked great and the bowls held the salad fruit and cereal like they were supposed to do The dishes are metal with enamel over them The one downfall was having to remove the Made in China stickers off of every dish prior to use So now I have a fear of lead poisoning I wish I had known prior to purchasing I wouldve searched for a brand that was Made in the USA Minus 1 star for not being made in the USA 
This is a good essentials set to have for two people Very light and sturdy The downsides are that the spoons are very shallow so they dont hold much liquid they dont hold heat at all so you have to be careful holding cups and putting plates on your lap and they get surprisingly hot sitting on a table in the 70 degree heat I may end up springing for one of the other kits made by MSR or GSI but for now this kit will work just fine and the price was right 
I had high hopes for this product I didnt want to use paper plates on our week long camping trip I didnt open the package until the day before we left for a week at Pinecrest One cup was chipped very bad and had to stay home Some other cups were chipped as well Besides that it seemed like a good set It will be going back however damaged goods 
This set is pretty nice overall They are super easy to clean and the silverware holder that rolls up and ties is very practical A few pieces in it didnt have the red coating completely covering all the surface area I think under the lip of one bowl and one plate Overall I would buy again at this point 
Works great packs up small stayed inflated all week provided plenty of cushion 
jus as described 
It is cheap and well designed I bought it since it is the brand Coleman But it seems little too thin 
the price was right but the picture is decieving i thought i was getting a pillow as well which as it turns out it doesnt come with i was disappointed about that and it does start to go flat over nigh 
great for camping 
Seems pretty good Im yet to try it out would be nice if I didnt contain chemicals known to cause cancer in it 
it was cloudy weekend camping trip but the black part did get warm and the water is down to room temperature so I assumed it is working and I still hang on a tree and use it to wash hand and face twas really nice 
Love it but it did leak around the opening a bit while laying flat to heat up Once hung up it works great Love that you can turn it on and off the nozzle 
I camp frequently and this hanger fills the need for something to place your lanterns around the campsite 
This mattress is comfortable but not that great First it doesnt come with the pillow as shown Second it takes forever to inflate roughly took 15 minutes to inflate if left alone I had to inflate it It had too level of inflation It was either to soft and you felt what was on the ground or it was to firm and felt like a board The straps on it was a nice feature for storage 
Bright light love the two settings Weve been camping with it twice and even set up our tent using it one time 
its just a generic plastic camp light i dont usually car camp so i needed something cheap to do so with some friends recently we used it quite a bit for a few nights and its still got juice theres not really any noticeable difference between the low and high setting that i could tell but i guess thats not a big deal if you want something cheap that will light up your campsite or the inside of your tent here you go 
I received this product and immediately set it up inside my home to make sure it all worked and the order was right The directions were straight forward One white pole that goes horizontally and two black poles that go vertically I had some trouble with one of the black poles being slightly longer than needed which made getting it into the little holder slot very difficult Getting it back into the package was a tight fit with moderate hassle Which is why I knocked off two stars Other than those two things I enjoy the tent It fits two adult size chairs and belongings as well It came with nice accessories and zips up to close the entire thing into a tent if necessary Great portability 
The rope in the tent rod snapped the first time I was using it Also one of the grommets came off 
Sturdy keeps stuff cold for a long time I used it on a recent trip 2 hours from my house The ice was still frozen when I arrived and still had ice the next morning It stayed cold for 2 days even with opening and closing pulling out stuff and adding things 
Our school loved it 
I love this net and what a deal Just over 100 with steel cable and wooden dowels I Live in San Diego where we have lots of poles that need a net I was a little bit skeptical at first because it was very inexpensive but the net is awesome I am easily able to tighten it at both the bottom and top so that you get amazing play out of the net I would highly recommend this if you are looking for a great beach net at a great price 
Great 
It works but lets be honest not very many people can lift five gallons of water And the hose is VERY short 
This dining ware set helps to complete the romantic picture of camping that my wife has She loves to wash the dishes after supper in the great wide open Good quality construction Everything is very sturdy Should last a lifetime of camping 

This thing puts out a lot of light but the DD batteries are pricy best find a good deal online instead of buying form store which is about 25 dollars or more 
Great for camping and when the power is out Low works the same as high and lasts longer so dont bother with usingtthe high mode 
This product would not be suited for extreme outdoor use or even casual outdoor use A childs mat is more like what this product could be used for Besides that I use this in combo with a ENO hammock and it works great to keep the cold out and give some form of rigidity to my hammock Compacts nicely to fit under a small pack and instead of letting it self inflate I blow two good breaths into the end and tighten it down Works well for this use but not as a ground mat 
FAIL from Coleman Firstly the product pictured is not what I received This picture shows an integrated pillow Not the case If I could attach a picture you would see a mat without a pillow and a kind of lumpy mat Secondly the inner padding is very very thin and offers no support At best this mat will offer a barrier between the ground and camper 
Works great i highly recommend this pad as it is easy to use and easier to fold It fits perfect under any camping bag 
Do not buy this pad I agree with all the bad reviews found here You may as well sleep on the ground with no padthat is how useless this Coleman pad is Do yourself a favor and go buy a hammock tent and never sleep on the ground again 
We have two other Coleman selfinflating pads Max I think and I hoped this would be like those It is wider but is not as thick I do think the longer it is able to inflate the thicker it gets but Im not sure it compares to the others 1 inch can make a difference when youre talking about sleeping on the ground Overall I do like it and we still use it but if I had it to do over Id probably get the thicker one 
Nice looking cooler I had it latched and forgot and gently pulled up the lid and the entire locking attachment on the inside came out Pretty sure thats not supposed to happen I was always a true beliver in Coleman products but after this last camping tripnot so much 
well made does its job UGA fan so love the colors 
Love this net used it a lot of times during summer and handles very well Very sturdy and this net will last for a long time with care it is worth the price Ive recommended this to a couple of friends out of state and ended up buying each of them Cant go wrong for the price and it is the lowest price i found for the same item 
I purchased 2 nets Park and both were setup outdoors Both nets absorbs the rain in between the seams on the bottom is worse and net became loose and wavy Not sure if I will buy the same model again I did my research and read reviews but none stated on outdoor weathered and if it survives through the rain I cant rate this a really good product 
These things work great 
We used these twice before most of the enamelware items had chipped extensively Old enamelware does not chip in this way With all the scares and concerns about heavy metal contamination in Chinese products I threw these out rather than have my children eat from them A waste of money 
Used for recent camping trip they added that camping feel to the meals that paper plates  cups dont Worth the money for the memories 
This a dining set for CAMPING So this item gets a 1 or 2 star review because of some white spreckles Really I have had a set that were handmedowns from my parents they are around 20 years old and you know what They are still doing the job in the woods in the snow in the dessert thier intended environment So some pretentious person wants to give them a bad review for not being the right color Go back to your precious little cookiecutter life get yourself some fine china and beware of camping it is not apparently for you 
Great little product Very useful 
Good to have at the campsite 
Excellent item glad I purchased 

I Bought this for an 11 day power outage A big storm knocked out power in our area for 11 days and this came in the middle of it I really enjoyed having it Its bright lasts a long time an is very useful It lit my room nicely and we used it in other areas of the house as well Im glad I bought it I also use it night fishing when I need some extra lite Durable and sturdy Its everything you expect from Coleman 
We received one of these as a housewarming present more than ten years ago and although its not a typical gift it was useful on many occasions Its dependable and the brightness option is great Recently we had a power outage and used ours again so I ordered this one for my sister So much better than candles in an emergency We keep it accessible in the hall closet where we can find it easily and quickly if we need it 
I took this little gem camping and we were actually able to cook at 10pm in the woods with this being our main light source This light was a great assest to our camping trip It lite up very well both on low  high It takes 8 D size batteries and they were enough to last 2 nights from around dusk Aug up the mountains until the wee hours of the morning bedtime lol running on high Was also bright enough to keep the racoons at bay lol I was going to put it away with the rest of the camping things then had second thoughts since its great for the home as well power outages or dark places in the home I highly recommend this lantern 
The item was delivered on time and in good condition this was a holiday gift for someone so I can not make a review on how it works or the operation at this time I will check with the person that I gave it to at a later date to see how they like it and its general operation 
I honestly am not a fan Although my little girl liked it I wish i would have read the reviews before hand It pushs the air around your body and not under it So you hit the ground 
Works great used it for a three camping trip my wife and I really liked the self inflating camping pad 
I bought this because I needed something to camp on beaches with It works great once it fills up But it is slow to inflate 
This thing is crazy heavy when full of beer and ice but a single strong person can lift it by themselves and carry it from the car to the pool Love the material and the look even heftier people can sit on it without breaking it The lock isnt a lock at all dont even try to lift this sideways or upside down when theyre stuff inside the lid will come off instantly All it does is add a bit of extra rubber friction to the lid to make it difficult for small children or sufficiently drunk fools to open No wheels makes it pain on long carries but no wheels means the wheels dont break or get covered in sand so thats a plus I love this cooler 
We had two of these showers on a Memorial Day camping trip and they made a big difference in our comfort The spigotshowerhead didnt leak but the fill cap is pathetic It may not leak if youre careful with it meaning you need to keep it upright at all times when full but it leaks readily otherwise So far the showerhead holds tight but it simply pulls out to open so Im not for how long that will be true On a hot day it can make water even hotter than it should be for a shower but its not magic On days in the low 80s it made water hot enough for a fairly comfortable shower within a few hours but it doesnt hold heat well at all So unless you want a tepidcool shower after the sun sets its a good idea to wrap it in a towel or two to try to retain some of that heat Still the opportunity for a nice shower at the end of a day outdoors is well worth the approximately 10 
F 
the hose was kinked had to make my own 
Thats the best feature of the enamel products Camping and cleaning go together and enamel products are easy to clean 
Must have for camping in woods 
These are what you need to hang a lantern on a tree instead of driving a nail in it 
bought this for camping wasnt sure if it was something I was gonna need or not I have used it on every camping trip works well for hanging the lantern on Glad I got it 
Flexible sizing makes it work on most trees For me the biggest plus was seeing all the hooks that baddisrespectful campers had put into trees to hold up their lightsother gear  knowing that I had the right tool for the job and wasnt damaging trees felt great 
This item is worthy of five stars 
Built well and handles a specific problem handily which is hanging a lantern off the ground on a tree Coleman also offers a collapsible lantern stand which is nice when there are no trees to use 
Good little hangers for lanterns when camping 
Its nice to be able to hang your lantern from a tree 
connection could be more handy but basically it works as expected 
i got this product from walmart about 2 years ago Ive used it probably about 50 times its kinda heavy it inflates easy holds air well and im not sure if its big in comparison to other pads all i know is im looking for something lighter Ive used this pad every time Ive gone hiking or camping or even backpacking it has NEVER failed me it makes the night alot easier if inflated enough you cannot just let it inflate by itself i let mine inflate and then i add a few extra puffs of air until its filled right you cant fill it too much or else it kinda becomes a ballon all in all im happy with it and if you need something just to go camping not backpacking then definitely buy this its quality update i got a new sleeping pad today a lightweight sleeping pad that still has more padding than this sleeping pad the air in the Coleman moves around too much so any weight you put on it in that spot the air just moves out of the way still would not recommend 
After blowing through what seemed more than our fair share of air mattresses I decided to take a different tack I remembered my fathers armyissue pad that inflated and was comfortable on hard surfaces I was much lighter at the time so that may have played some role I was happy when I found these and I bought two since they seemed so similar to what I had in mind The products description is right It does self inflate The problem is what you do after they self inflate You can leave the valve open but then you have no padding Or you close out the valve and you trap the air in The problem is that the air rushes around to where there is no pressure on the pad and you again have no padding but this time you have ballooning where the air rushed to Basically your padding becomes a foot support These were returned the next day I do no recommend this product If I were to make a recommendation to the manufacturer I would tell them to find a way to isolate the air so that it actually creates padding where it is needed One way would be to create chambers so that air movement would be restricted As is the product is useless for my purposes and I am having trouble imagining a situation where it would not be I went and bought another air mattress the next day 
It was difficult at first how to set the tent up because the directions are a little complicated but after finally completing it the first time you wont forget Its a great looking tent This is my first time ordering anything like this and with kids I hope it lasts The tent is well made and the multiple features of opening doors and screen door features are cool Its much bigger than I had anticipated too  the only bad thing I can say is that its really hard to fold the whole thing back into compact form in order to make it all fit back into its carrying bag Its not something that you can just throw into a bag so you may either have to buy a big carrying bag or learn how to fold well  im sure its probably a skill that will need to be developed over time Other than that a great item and Im happy with the purchase 
great product easy to use grandbabies loved it on the beach 
We bought two of these before the recent bad weather It came in handy when the lights went out It doesnt put enough light out to make you forget you dont have power but it is a great purchase nonetheless to take with you from room to room It is light to carry and the casing is strong enough to withstand a drop or two There isnt much of a difference from the hi and lo settings but the light output on either is more than adequate for a battery operated lantern 
love the lock 
Took this camping with temps in the upper 90s and feels like temps in the 100s and it held ice for several days This was our beverage cooler and was opened probably 15 times daily and was left in the bed of the truck We did purchase another bag of ice on the 3rd day because the 2 bags we had put in there were almost completely melted Considering the heat  how much this was used we are super happy 
I used this cooler the first weekend I went out After 4 days the original ice I put in it was still there when I came home Yes a lot of it was melted but a lot of ice still remained and all the rest of my food and drinks were still cold I love it 
This was a good idea but unfortunately its like an oven The shade provided is minimal and its way too hot to hang out inside of for very long I ended up returning it It wasnt quite what I was looking for 
This was a waste of money The pressure that comes out is ridiculous I hung it up on the fence just to rinse kids feet off before going into the house and It couldnt even do that I love everything Coleman except this 
Received this in a timely fashion Holds a lot of water My only complaint is that the shower nozzle is flimsy and easily kinks when you maneuver it shutting off the water flow 
Works pretty good I liked it 
Bought this to avoid the showers at Coachellafor future camping trips and it is well worth the price Having a portable warm shower is a game changer Seller got the item to me with no issues 
I hang the bag on a wooden post about waist height in yard that gets plenty of direct sun in the summer And I fill it with a nearby hose and by the next day its good to go If its a nice summer day with plenty of sun it can really warm the up nicely I use it to wash my hands and face before going inside And truthfully I use it to give my dog outdoor baths to cut down on the shower mess 
worked perfect 
very pleased 
Normally I try not to write bad reviews but its not reliable I wouldnt trust a full lantern with it on a calm night much less a windy one I find the chain loosens up and the whole thing falls Also the dip where the lantern hangs is too shallow for complete safety in my opinion Save your money and buy the stand for lanterns or use a good solid limb This performs exactly like a vacuum 
This is pretty useless Hang it from a limb or get the stand 
This roller guide was easy to install and fit perfectly onto my boat trailer I recommend having a friend help install it with you since it can be a bit cumbersome with just one person although doable I have a 14 boat and this works perfectly to keep in straight while trying to land a boat in a current or with wind The quality is top notch the rubber rollers will prevent marring of my aluminum boat skin Also its made in the USA which is always nice With that I would recommend this if you find yourself alone trying to land a boat in current or wind They do help keep the boat straight on the trailer Overall good product 
These guides are exactly what I needed to help align the boat when loading onto the trailer Installation took a little time but was easy enough to do They seem to be made solidly and should last for years A most satisfactory purchase 
I bought this for a camping trip and it worked very well Its very bright and lightweight It is not the metal Coleman lanterns of my youth with the glowing gas mantles but instead a modern plastic body with a fluorescent tube that takes 8 D batteries It has 2 settings but honestly I couldnt see a lot of difference between low and high I have trusted Coleman products my whole life and this one is no exception I think its a good value for the money 
Great in wind and when you get bit chilly you can close the zipper instant warmthGreat Product 
Love this tent  only issue with it is that the metal rings used for anchoring the poles are cheaply made and pop out which effectively renders the tent useless till you come up with an alternative way to keep the pole from going through further than it should I still gave it 4 stars because I was able to work around this defect and had a great overall experience with the tent easy to put up take down love that it has a floor and can seal up from bugs or for privacy 
This is a full on tent not what I would think of as a beach tent The set up requires multiple poles I returned this tent and opted for a pop up lighter version 
thats good but it could be better it leeks out all the water when I filled it up I didnt have the opportunity if it gets hot or not cuz it just leaked out 
Very easy to use and works perfectly no leaks 
This performed exactly as it should have on our boat Stood up to the Florida and Bahamian sun for a couple months now 
Its functional 
Its a great concept and can work But I just could not get it to hold my dual fuel lantern First problem is the angle it is held at The little dip that holds the lantern handle is held at a low point that I do not trust holding a 50 flammable object The second problem is the Shook that you connect the chain with is constantly falling off I have lost mine after one weekend I just got a nice nail from my toolbox hammered it in and hung my lantern Ill play with this a little more and see if it can meet my needs 
It should come in handy and came fast and was as described 
very good item 
great camping accessory 
works great 
chain can be slightly short for trees in the pacific northwest but nice for longer term camping 
These rugged heavyduty electrical lanterns are just the ticket during power outages We originally bought one for use on our boat We get power outages once or twice a year though and we discovered that there is nothing better to have on hand for such occasions than this lantern They are very frugal of battery power and have many hours of illumination per set We have since bought several for use during outages These lanterns are built tough and should last a lifetime Recommended RJB 
We purchased this lantern for primarily indoor use we lose power a lot in our area and have not been disappointed Yes as some reviewers have said it uses a lot of D cell batteries 8 I think but we havent had to change them yet and our lantern continues to shine brightly as ever And bright it is We find it more than adequate to light an entire room My husband has even taken it outdoors to provide light while he grills We will certainly be purchasing another and would recommend it to others I found it very reasonably priced for how well it works and how durable it seems to be 
The tent itself worked great The 3 stars is because the metal ring that the pole goes through broke off the second time we used it 
Great beach addition It was super windy and this tent was perfect to keep us warm This is also great to block the sun too 
Works well 
sweet 
Great Product 
Works great 
These are perfect for cooking while camping I love the bright red color because it makes them hard to lose or misplace The same comment for the ring that connects them together Pretty much anyone Ive gone camping with since I got them has commented on the ring being a genius idea Also I didnt have the problems some people posted about where the red came off onto their hand and I have cooked meals 3 times a day and washed after every use on 3 weekend camping trips since I purchased these 
Nice 
This is no fishing boat cooler The main reason I purchased this item is because of the design and color Kudos to Coleman for understanding that their customers appreciate great looking design as much utility The vintage look rounded lid steel hardware bottle opener and the cool colors will look fantastic whether youre having a pool party glamping in your canned ham or icing down Dom Perignon on your vintage yacht I ordered the rose and its stunning 
Great cooler Latch is great Hinges great Sloped internal drain Rubberized bottom Great cooler 
Works perfectly 
Genious  six stars if possible 
Pretty simple item specifically made for Coleman Lanterns not much to be said for it besides that it works as advertised and is a quality product It should be lasting as long as the lantern itself does 
great equipment i hang trash bag with theses as well as lantern Mist places say no nails in trees so this works awesomely 
It is okay I guess Necessary No But it is easier to take on and off with my lantern instead of running it through line that I have to undo each time I want to move it 
Uses 8 D batteries and gives enough light for our 10 x 10 tent We used it for one night only but it looks like it will hold at least 2 nights of power Highly recommended to buy for camping or just addition to our survival kit 
This Coleman FAMILY size Lantern is great It provides a nice bright light it has both a Bright and also a Low setting You can light up quite a large area with this lantern Its about a foot and a half tall counting the handle Its rugged and takes 8 D cell batteries I use high capacity rechargeable batteries and they last for a long long time Even though its 8 batteries it last a super long time so it is well worth the price of batteries This is great for camping but also great for power outages such as the one we just experienced hear in the North East I was able with three lanterns this family size Coleman and two personal size lanterns one Colman and one a generic brand to keep much of our home lighted In a really bad situation if you have rechargeable batteries and a solar charger you can have light indefinitely I can highly recommend this product for anyone 
I purchased this lantern for my wifes friend She was very impressed with the quality and how bright it is I want one now 
Ive been using a Coleman propane lantern for years and while its great when its hung from a nearby tree its not the best to have at your picnic table A broken globe and a few accidental bumps with an arm later and I decided to add this battery powered option to the collection I recommend high capacity rechargeable D batteries to help boost its run time It has exceeded my expectations and I know Im not tossing 816 D batteries into the garbage at the end of my weekend Lantern including the globe is made of durable hard plastic Its not heavy but has a solid feel to it Bright in both low and high settings Does not get hot to the touch so its perfectly safe on your picnic table Theres still a place for my propane lantern on my campsite but thanks to this reliable lantern its far away from the table 
I purchased this family size lantern and also a smaller one for emergency purposes They are not super sturdy but good enough since I wont be using them on a regular basis only as emergency lighting ifwhen we lose power or should a disaster happen Both lanterns with plenty of unopened batteries are in my emergency container with my other emergency items Worth the peace of mind 
Products seem to be of good quality I think the red color will help in finding therm 
Very handy to have around I use it in my camping set Very nice 
great for camping 
not as sturdy as i was hoping 
This set works just as good as any other sets out there Best thing is the ring keep them together while traveling 
These worked great for our camping trip recently Easy to find red and stayed together with the ring provided when they werent in use Easy to clean too 
Worked well on my camping trip 
We havent taken it to the beach yet but I set it up in the living room and I have to admit its pretty tough So its just like a tent with poles that slide threw sleeves sewn into the tent for some reason it binds up and is very hard to do that With that being said its very nice when set up and seems very durable I kind of wish I would have went with instant sun shade that coleman makes if I had it to do over 
Nice product however note that this is not an easy up tent You will need to get out the rods assemble the rods route them through the tent stake down the tent I have a large camping tent for 5 people that sets up faster than this When you get to the beach you want to plop down quickly plop something down and relax This is not the tent for you if that is what you want I would check out one of the lightspeed options if so 
I have used this a lot make sure to open back panal in high wind situations 
Now I can hang my lamp Cant wait to see on tree 
These are the best way to utilize your lantern while camping Indispensable 
These hangers also work for lighter weight solar showers  the kind that you fill with water and leave in the sun for awhile to warm up Keep in mind that water weighs about 8 pounds per gallon so dont expect the hangers to hold huge amounts of water The hangers also work well to hold up shower heads on battery or rechargeable camping shower pumps These hangers really grip into the tree bark I have left them up permanently at a camping spot we own and there has been only minor rust even though they go through snow rain etc 
Thanks they all came together and in great shape great packing job and no damage to my supprise thanks lots could not ask for better serviceChuck Wise Sr PortlandOr 
Could you rig something yourself that would do the job just as well Probably Still Im glad I bought this for my Dual Fuel lantern It hangs on just about anything and keeps the lantern safe and secure I use it in the Mojave and Ive rigged it to cottonwoods Joshua trees and rock outcrops 
The chain could be a bit longer trees around here grow mighty big It works though and feels sturdysafe for hanging your lantern 
Kept our food cold for three days of camping Instead of loose ice I used frozen bottles of water for an odor and mess free cleanup Love it 
Difficult to mount in a manner to collect the solar energy while also being able to dispense Still the best solution for a mostly effective portable shower 
This works well if you just want hot water Its not realy a shower more a small drizzle of water If you plan on using it to wash your hair dont bother But it would do ok if you just want a quick wash down 
Design is good Water gets hot fairly fast Hose is a bit flimsy and way too long You have to hoist this thing way up in a tree to get an overhead shower feel The shower head is also too small giving you a bit more than a trickle but thats okay because theres not a lot of water in these things Drying them out is very hard Storing wet will lead to mildew so you have to get a hair dryer and blow them dry No other way to do it 
So far so good These are built pretty well and Ive been able to use it one time It was still pretty cold after 3 hours but it was 50 out and partly cloudy so I expect better next time I use it The water flow could also be improved 
Dont know how I ever camped without it 
Perfect for haning up a tree for a soothing shower after swimming in salty water 
good coleman quality Perfect for the weekend camper 

Worked well on a recent camping tripnot as stiff as I likebut adequate 
They are what they are and served their purpose on a camping trip 
Fast shipping Good quality camp set 
I love the Coleman Road Trip Beach Shade Its easy to pack in a checked bag and lightweight for hauling around Its easy to set up once you get the hang of it Lay out the canopy part thread three collapsible pole through mesh bend the poles and put them in grommets Stake it and youre done Three adults and an infant fit comfortably inside ours It protected us from the direct sun and heat extremely well The bag says its SPF 50 Im pleased by the performance It allowed us to stay out on the beach for a lot longer than we would without I took one star off for two flaws 1 the elastic material inside one of the poles snapped after one use but Coleman is working with us on that one 2 its incredibly hard to get everything back in the bag but not impossible 
Bought it at the wrong time will have to wait till summer to test it but did open it to see how it would work Looks very straightforward Saw an online video  a women setting it up I am ready for summer Instructions are stitched to the bag And that causes a problem  you have to keep shelter in the bag but it is a PITA to this back inside the puny bag Soooo hard but managed to squeeze it in So it may be easy to set up and take it down but putting inside the bag will take good 15 min 
This is a nice addition to a campsite when you want to hang a lantern high I just used this for a week hang the holder correctly and the lantern will hang great and secure 
For hanging both lanterns and solar showers I have three 2 for lanterns 1 for a shower Nothing sophisticatedjust wrap around a tree and youll have a solid mount 
I was going to purchase this on Amazon before our last camping trip and ended up forgetting about it While on our trip and browsing WalMart yes I always forget something critical while packing I came across this little item for the same price as listed here I picked one up and set it up at camp and forgot how useful it is to have the lantern well above eye level Most of our camp was illuminated and almost eliminated the use of flashlights at night I also purchased a propane treelantern stand but found it much more useful to use a propane extension adapter hose from my 20 lb tank and hanging this from a tree The only negative comment I have is regarding the chain it is a little flimsy and I hope it holds up If not it can easily be replaced at the hardware store 
I got this to attach a bird feeder to a palm tree no limbs and it works great I have also used it to hang a camping lantern when I am out grilling past sunset handy thing to have in your camping supplies 
Bought this lantern for a 3 days camping trip This lantern is very bright and last for a long time It still has a lot of battery power left after the trip Dont forget to take out the batteries and save it for next trip or emergency Highly recommended this product 
I bought this lantern because we didnt have enough light for our trip last year This lantern performs beautifully Its nice and large doesnt require flammable fuel isnt too heavy  and its bright white light    bright enough to light up our 10 x 10 canopy area There is a high and low setting but the low setting is not very much lower than the high setting so we set it on low to conserve the battery life Ive just gotten back from a two night camping trip and this lantern has plenty of juice left in it I am happy with this lantern and would buy it again 
Held ice for nearly 2 days at a time while strapped to a trailer exposed to the sun and heat on a cross country summer trip This is made very solid for the money you would be hard pressed to find a better value 
excellent 
In an age when your choice is a 300 deluxe model or a 1495 piece of junk from your local discount store this cooler remains an icon for a good reason It works and it holds up Period As a Scout leader camper hunter and fisherman Ive used about every cooler there is out there and after yard saling the rest this is the one I kept Get one in a color you like  itll be around as long as you are 
Perfect for outdoor camp gear 
Okay product Coleman is not the company they were in the past 
Nice  
Good quality hard to hand clean when cooking greasy foods 
Great product and especially for the price 
Works great at the beach and even in the yard for shade 
We bought this for the beach at Lake Tahoe Once it was up it provided great shelter but it was awful trying to put this thing together We should have had a dry run before getting to the beach that way we didnt look like complete fools trying to put it together on site After a day in the water and sun the last thing we wanted to do was try to deconstruct the thing so we just took out the poles and wadded it up and threw it in the back of the car to deal with later 
Havent found a good alternative yet so Im giving this 3 stars based on that We used this for a season and while when it works its awesome and useful when it doesnt its a waste of time and money The spout at the bottom of the bag gets warm in the sun and the plastic softens leading to the tube to pop off andor leak When we put the bag in the sun wed have to position it on a rock so that the force of the water is at the top end Then if that works ie if we leave for the day to go hiking and the bag hasnt leaked to empty we hang the bag from a tree and hope the tube stays put in the opening while we shower or wash dishes After about a half dozen uses the tube kept popping off and it was just too annoying to deal with Thats why Im on here now looking for an alternative to the hanging solar shower 
Plastic tore around pipe handle on first use bag not even completely filled Shower head functions by pulling end out or pushing in Very slow flow rate low water pressure 
I bought this for my 1 week elk hunt It was nice to finally get to bathe in warm water while camping 
Nice set like that the bag holds everything when youre done It is a sturdy set overall Wish the price was a little better but gave it 4 stars because the overall quality is good 
I had a version of these and I left them at the last camp siteoops Bought a replacement actually bought 2 
bought two of these Chain is a little flimsy but will work for my needs Taken care of they will last a long time 
This is just another one of those inexpensive musthave things to throw in with your camping gear next to your lanterns Park Rangers dont like you banging nails or screwing hooks into the trees In fact they dont even seem to care if you arent the guy who put the hardware into the tree but just the guy like me who saw it already there and decided to use it  
Who would of thought that this little hanger wouod make a world of difference when camping especially at night It was easy to use and didnt take to much space in our camping gear 
Well OK I dont sneer at hurricanes But after Hurricane Ike and a week without power we decided to upgrade our emergency lighting to more than flashlights candles and chemical light sticks I bought three of these familysized Coleman lanterns and three MicroPacker lanterns also reviewed The first time I turned on this familysized lantern I said WOW This is a serious light I measured the light output of this lantern Im a photojournalist and discovered it puts out half the light of a bare 40 watt bulb but much much more light than a 25 watt bulb That is plenty of light for reading and walking around like a human being instead of stumbling around with flashlights The low setting is almost as bright as the high setting only onehalf stop dimmer but extends the battery life from 17 hours to a fantastic 28 hours I figure one set 8 of fresh D cells should last though a week of dark nights The familysized lantern is tough and wellmade Its not waterproof but I wouldnt worry about taking it out into the rain It doesnt have rubber seals but the nice tight fittings should keep it dry One minor point the large clear housing is a Coleman tradition but a simple clear cylinder would be more streamlined and compact The lantern is about the size of a fullsized gas mantle unit I wouldnt backpack with it but it is a great unit for emergencies and base camps Now if Coleman only made a batterypowered air conditioner    
Used these camping and were perfect and easy to clean 
highly recommended everything I is excelllent 
This is a nice little set that I use when we go out camping The build quality is good enough for me and my family but then again Im not a brand snob and grew up with a lot less Id say these are about the same quality that most families would use in their household The three are linked together with a ring and are red which I like because its easy to keep them together and the red a easy to spot If mine were to break I would buy again Now Im not saying I expect them to break but Im clumsy and well sometimes things break 
super nice  
Good product 
Works very well with the nonstick pots and pans easy clean up Recommend 
great 
I have used solar showers of various sizes for decades and love them This one is much larger than I expected  difficult for an old body to hoist over a tree limb when full I plan to use a pulley system next time out As far as complaints about the water getting too hot or not hot enough my only comment is these are for camping and if you want perfection stay home 
havent tried it yet but satified with it 
My previous steelbelted Coleman cooler lasted 30 years and it got used all the time This one looks even sturdier and I expect it to go 30 plus years as well Best cooler out there 
Great cooler holds ice for a few days 
This looks really nice love the black wish it did come with a bottle opener like the other blue one but it still looks great Also keeps cold for about 2 12 days 
Wont last through high winds on the beach 
This shade had too many parts and was not easy to put together I ended up returning it 
use this a the beach all the time and its held up really well so far 1st time putting it together can be tricky but after that its a breeze 
Nice set Great quality net and rackets 
Good product lots of fund sturdy 
Great 
These have come in very handy when cooking outdoors 
Arrived on time Excellent purchase Operates as advertised 
Thank you and I look forward to other offers 
Good enough for camping 
Has held up well during our latest camping trip 
Better than I thought theyd be Only used for camping but could be easily used in the kitchen everyday 5 stars because this is mandatory when cooking for four people out in the woods 
My family has spent endless hours playing badminton The net takes some time 15 minutes between 2 adults to put up so we just play without it most of the time The bag and rackets work just fine and have lasted over a year of play 
Pain to put together Didnt even bother finishing putting it together Will not be using 
Used this on at the outer banks It was excellent Even in high wind it held up and protected my son and wife from the wind and sun A must have for families with children going to the beach Provides an escape from the sun allowing longer stays at the beach This particular model is very functional You are able to zip up the window and door and use it as a changing tent to change out of or into your bathing suit I highly recommend this item 
This shade is a little cumbersome to assemble and you really need another adult to help but when it is up it provides great shade at the ballpark beach or backyard Theres plenty of room inside for kids to play or adults to take a break from the sun at the beach or park It rolls up nicely into the surprisingly small carry bag and is light weight enough to easily take anywhere If you arent in a hurry to set it up this is a GREAT sun shade 
Im not really the biggest beach fan but we had a week at the beach with my  1yo and wanted to get something to keep her out of the sun This little shelter was awesome we were able to be out on the beach all day without burning yes we still used sunscreen and she was even able to nap inside every day Easy to set up and easy to break down and store The sandbags did a great job of keeping the shelter down in the breezes 
We stacked a couple coolers and put up in a tree pretty high Really lit up the campsite and didnt have to have the lanterns on the table while kids were eating Simple and Great 
A rather robust simple hanger for your Coleman or any brand really lantern Does not collapse for packing and will not fit in your lantern case Considering the target audience is likely camping within reach of their vehicle this is unlikely to be overly burdensome Simple inexpensive effective Cant go wrong 
Very easy to hook around a tree I have hung both propane and kerosene lanterns The kerosene lantern is obviously heavier but this hanger held it with zero problems One of my must have camping items when I take the family camping 
Super super useful product and takes up virtually no space vs those tripod style lantern holders I just wish I felt more confident about the chain that is used on this Ive had no problems yet and probably never will but the chain seems thin making me concerned about longterm use Just something to keep my eye on I guess 
I have two of these lantern stands and I like them I have other types of lantern stands as well so if I am using the others I can always use these to hang towels or coats from Nothing like having an item that can do double duty 
A lantern in camp is a wonderful thing if youve got a place to put it Preferably the lantern will be above your head so it can give the greatest amount of light and away from people who might bump into it and tip it over This little device allows you to wrap the length of chain around a nearby tree trunk and then hang you lantern high enough to do the most good Its also a handy hanger for your wet towel during the daylight hours Just make sure that there arent any combustable materials read dry branches too close overhead You dont want to use your lantern to start a fire This is one of the must have items that doesnt add any weight to your packing but really adds a lot of convenience I recommend this to anyone who uses a lantern 
Worked pretty well as a shower on my most recent camping trip The nozzle works well and is easy to use and the 5 gallon capacity was enough for three people to quickly shower twice with a little left over I do have a couple of complaints though The seal on the cap isnt very good and it leaked constantly until we reinforced it with some duct tape The other issue is the hanging hardware included was pretty cheap and poorly suited to the task of suspending the shower from a tree limb Highly recommend you bring along some paracord or several bungies to get the job done properly 
Great for when you need it Water warms nicely in the sun 
Grandparents had the original for over 30 years new one is a bit different but I like it works for what I need 
Nice and love the case 
No complaintslotsa fun Great house warming gift 
It will serve you well But this one is heavy to carry so be aware Great size for a 4 adults Good features and construction 
ThankYou 
Like the ring to keep it together Besides that pretty standard utensil set 
less rigid than id like ultimately making their use not as pleasant as something with better build quality Nothing to get all bent out of shape for tho Theyre fine 
Used these last weekend They held up and did what I needed them to do I like the ring there on so as to keep them together Would recommend 
Great camping utensils Im very happy with them 
Works good in a pinch 
By far this is the best Badminton set I have had The aluminum poles make the set light and easy t6o carry The net is solid and the carry case is well made The aluminum rackets are nice The birdies are not feathered but they are good enough for family play 
We are getting really good use out of this set Not bad at all rackets could be a little nicer but the set up is easy and I like that it came with the boundary line Definitely good for casual play 
Semi easy setup Doesnt breathe very well Pole guides are mesh and tearsnag easy Dont pay more than 30 
We purchased this for our beach trip and it was easy to set up and take down and provided enough shade for our toddler while we were out on the beach 
Its a nice novelty but no way can it truly stay up for long periods of time on a windy beach Its really hard to put up on the beach with the ocean wind competing with you Id probably just go back to a nice big beach umbrella and anchor Would not buy it again 
nice 
Works as expected no suprises Only used it one time but it seemed to be a good product Would buy again 
I use these tools in my kitchen at home not just for camping They are lightweight sturdy and comfortable A good value 
got these to take camping to use with my coleman stovegrill not for every day use but great for camping 
These are all you need to cook when camping they looks good and are very durable a good set get yours 
These are nothing to write home about but they got the job done I definitely will be looking for some better ones in the future and once we start camping more But these were great for just starting out 
It cooking utensils what can we saylol they work as described We bought them for camping due to the color matching our set 
Great set for camping or home Easy to clean and use The ring that binds them together is also a nice feature when camping 
Not a cheap set everything is built sturdy If you want one to last get this set 
Decent set Pretty easy to set up Would be better if there were spikes at the end of the poles to push into the ground to make it a little sturdier Shuttlecocks are all plasticfeathers fly better Based on other reviews I thought the rackets would be a little stronger 
Its inexpensiveand cheap Works OK if a big IF you dont mind that the plug isnt tight so almost anything you do with it will cause water to come out of it Other solar powered bags have plugs that screw on which makes the unit much more leakproof Bought one Will go back to others They cost a bit more but are not as messy 
I made the mistake of thinking i could travel around with this solar shower filled while in my car for when I go spearfishing and want to wash off between dives while shore diving More than once it leaked in my car from the shower head from what I can tell The shower is great for filling it up and leaving it in one place but driving around with a 5 gallon bag of water was probably not my smartest move 
just ok 
I bought the turquoise Coleman Cooler last year at an unbelievable price locally It is so beautiful and retro looking I fell in love with it Thick insulation and convient plug for water to drain I cant imagine spending money on a YETI when this functions perfectly and looks like you went back to the 1950s when turquoise was the hottest color 
I WENT A BIT CRAZY ON YOUR SITE AS OF LATE BECAUSE I DISCOVEREDS ALL YOUR RED KITCHEN ITEMS LOVE THEM 
Perfect for camping Spatula for flipping burgers and eggs a straining spoon for pasta and a stirring spoon for mixing I use all three every time I go camping A must have for ALL campers 
Picked this up for a recent camping trip and it was a total hit Added a pack of Ohuhu LED shuttlecocks and the adults were playing this late into the night in pitch blacknessafter a few cocktails Well made set and packs away easily The case was plenty big enough that packing didnt seem like a game of Tetris 
Good quality item 
I love it 
We live close to the beach but there arent always showers close We fill these we have two  one for my sisters family and one for mine with warm water and head out When we get back covered in sand we hook these over the door or hinge on the trunk and rinse off before getting into the car That way the sand stays at the beach  Love these shower bags 
Great for camping 
Weve only used this once but it worked fine Holds quite a bit of water No problems with ripping or leaking Water warmed in the sun easily Great for primitive camping 
Thank You Excellent product  
We bought this a sun shade for the lake and beach for our baby girl and it worked excellently It opens up and sets up quite easily when there is no shade The mat extends out nice and far so there is lots of room inside We can fit a nice blanket inside which makes it much more comfortable We really love this 
Best thing for the beach with a 18 month old and a 2 year old 
Weve had this for quite some time now Use it every time we go to the beach Works great Protects great 
We carry two of these when car camping A stainless one for cold perishables and this red one for other food Keeps the Corgis and other critters away from the good stuff when camping 
This is a joke There is nothing steel about it All plastics except for the hinges You can get the same quality for 50 less 
I have wanted one of these for YEARS so maybe Im a little biased but I love this thing It has a very classic look to it and it keeps things plenty cold We used it for a road trip and it kept things plenty cold for three days The downsides  The latch is not the strongest thing in the world and would be a dealbreaker for me if I needed something I could rely on to stay closedie tossing it around on a boat or on a hunting or camping trip where large foraging animals might be a real possibility If you overfill the cooler even SLIGHTLY the latch fails instantly and wont even keep the lid closed The handles are metal which I both love and hate It looks awesome but can make it a little uncomfortable to carry over longer distances 
Love it 
This is a pretty decent badminton set for the price We live in a REALLY windy area and the net and poles stay in place rather well The rackets and birdies included are not as nice as the net but they do suffice Youll definitely want to get better birdies but all in all a great set for the money 
Got this set for my wife as a Christmas present because of all the good reviews We put it up in the backyard this past weekend Nice set The rackets seem kind of light weight but they do their job of hitting the birdie back and forth very nicely The poles net and rope all seem to be of very good quality The instructions included kind of suck but my wife figured them out nonetheless With the included anchors and the rope you can get the net nice and tight We have now enjoyed a few games and definitely look forward to more outdoor fun  Oh and thankfully the shuttlecocks provided with the kit are synthetic and not real feathers so no animals had to be harmed just for our enjoyment Definitely an added plus   
Love this thing for the beach for my wife 
Filled it up with 5 gals and although it is heavy I have confidence in the structural integrity of the bag to support the waterweight Ive had no issues with it other than water leakage on the plug when its laid sideways but thats a minor issue considering the convenience it has given me I use it to shower and wash my camp items 
Used this for a festival awesome product When filled it had plenty of water for 3 guys to take multiple showers over a few days Kept the water warm if it sat in the sun and kept it cool if left in the shade Never camp without one 
When I handed this to my kids before they headed off to go camping they looked at me as if I had two heads When they returned home after their trip all they could do it is talk about how wonderful this was how happy they were that I got it for them They used it for themselves for dishes for you anything you needed water for Great product 
Ive been using the version of this since I was a Peace Corps volunteer in Africa in 1979 Reliable durable more than enough water No better solution of weight versus function 
Who ever has taken over the manfacture of this product has finally made it so cheap that it does not work for its intended purpose I have been using this shower design for decades on my boat The most recent one I bought is so poorly constructed that it is useless The tube is made of such flimsy material that it collapses and makes flow impossible If you look closely at the picture you can see that the tube will occlude if it is not absolutely straight and mine cannot be made to produce anything other than a drip even when straight Also the fill cap on these units have always leaked but I used to put up with that but now that they use such a cheap tube it is useless I realize the more expensive versions of this are double the cost but this one is worthless 
I have used this several times now on the beach and while camping It holds plenty of water and is very resistant to tearing and puncturing 
To pretty to use I save it to use more like a center piece with ice only Very nice 
Really nice badminton set Looks like it should last awhile I also liked that is was a specific badminton set and not a volleyballbadminton set It was regulation size for badminton The rackets were ok for beginners but nothing great 
Thing is OK Holds a good amount of water and was able to get lukewarm after sitting outside on a rock all day in the Sierra Nevada mountain range We only had about 3 gallons in it Didnt leak We ended up using it to wash dishes and it worked well Probably would pack it to wash handsdishes again Cant see this thing being used as a shower Pros  Holds a good amount of water easy to use No leaks Cons  Only was able to get lukewarm after sitting outside on a rock 4th of July weekend while camping in the Sierras 
Its a bit flimsy and there are no directions on how to actually use the thing I have never used a solar shower before and didnt know that I had to pull the little shower head to actually let the water flow out My feet got absolutely soaked when I was messing with it but was so relieved that I didnt get a defective unit that I didnt care about my wet toes 
ABSOUTLY AMAZING Took this to a country music festival camping trip and hung on the side of my tent Just used it with my bikini on Haha and sat in a chair and washed my hair For sure happy with this purchase 
Second time we have purchased one of these Got it for the grandbaby to keep her cool when we are offshore  
Very high quality I dont even look in the rearview mirror after hitting a pot hole anymore 
Great product at a great price this is stainless steel so will last forever The other pair we had was rubber coated steel and it eventually rusted through This one will stay with the boat for a long time I am sure 
The product is current in use on my boat and is doing the job nicely The only negative comment that I might have is that the velco strap on the tie down could stand to be a little wider 
Great for playingsets up easy and takes down quick great for back yards 
Tedious to set up  the strings and pull for both poles was more work than I thought it would be  but once set up its fairly sturdy The racket quality is a cheap for what youre charging but were having fun playing So a 3 star 
Pros high quality aluminum standards and net Cons shuttlecocks dont seem like they will last too long rackets have steel handles and will probably rust over time 
Bought this bad boy to save me from melting at Folly beach during the sweltering summer heat It has a lot of space and setup time is quick Also pretty durable material because at the beach the wind stays in the 1015 mph range and gusts 20mph often and this shade stood strong 4 starts because the front loop to stake down came undone after second use No biggie needle and thread later and Im back in business If you want to block the sun and sit in the shade in style this shade is for you 
This camping shade is pretty nice and roomy I set it up by myself in the living room I have to say that it would be much simpler if it had clips instead of the really long pole sleeves but that might be for stability The grommets at the floor for stakes and poles are very flimsy so I have already knocked one out which is too bad since I like this concept and it will easily fit into my suitcase Oh ya and it took forever to get this item I have prime and it took several months I finally had to contact amazon and ask what the problem was I had ordered blue which was I guess backordered but amazon was dropping the affiliation so they were never going to get it I had to ask if they had any for instance in another color because I didnt want to just cancel She said yes they had several other colors so I picked orange They charged me more than the one I ordered and when it came it was yellow So weird but I think this is going to work out despite all the problems 
Thank you 
This cooler is great My dad used to have one just like it that lasted for almost 20 years But his didnt have a bottle opener on the side This thing is very solid and well built but not overly heavy It keeps drinks cool and the ice lasts a decent amount of time obviously longer the more you keep the lid closed Also love the latching lid makes it much easier to keep the ice from melting 
Works great 
1 

Used this at the beach and it worked great Gave us a great place to store stuff out of the sun and to take a break from the direct sunlight 
Not what I expected Cheesy drain Not what the one in the old days were like 
very sturdy 
High quality  great stainless stern buckles for a great price Thank you 
Quick shipping  as advertisedA 
Great price for stainless hardware 
Got these to replace my old black painted ones that got rusted over a short amount of time These will not rust and are very easy to use compared to the ratchet style that many people have These you just flip the lever down and it stays rock solid Great design 
works great 
Seem to be well made No problems so far No rust Just be careful when you loosen them If you put them too light and your hand is in the way when you loosen you will get pretty bruised So far they seem deserving of the full 5 stars 
Great net really sturdy and easy to set up The rackets and birdies are just okay but new rackets and birdies are cheap so it really doesnt bother me since I bought this mainly for the net setup The only thing I wish this set had was a way to mark the serve lines and boxes You need some sort of chalk or paint to mark these on your own since they only include a outside boundary line string marker 
FUN FUN everything you need  A 
Fun Good construction Easy to ensemble 
Used this at the beach and it was perfect Plenty of room for two beach chairs and enough room behind chairs for a sleepy kid or two Loved that it had the extra mat in front Its fairly easy easy to setup Not a popup though but easy none the less Just wish the mesh sleeves had some lining to make it easier for the poles to slide out Fit our needs which is shade and ventilation Great product and price 
This is awesome for baby on the beach After the first time putting it together you can set it up pretty quickly Used it in San Diego to shade our 4 month old but adults liked the shade too Nice quality folds down to a really small bag and the window is great if you want a nice breeze 
My wife love it Its so easy to put together 
These thing works awesomely 
Does what it says it will Warms the water nicely Good to have for camping or for prepping 
For what you pay and what you get with this cooler it is of EXCELLENT value I did what everyone else probably didlooked at the Yetis and dreamedand drooled Then got a brisk slap across the face from my wife when she thought I might actually pay 600 ON A COOLER Those Yetis may be amazing but those prices are just absurd and cannot be justified by anyone who isnt literally a mountain man or a hunter who needs ice not to freeze for 10 days Most of us normal guys who go weekend camping dont fall into either of those categories and so we turn our Yeti search into a what cooler is also awesome but doesnt cost me my first born child search Ive only ever owned Coleman and Igloo coolers and so that search began with those two When I was underwhelmed with what Igloo had out there I made the switch to Coleman and was immediately impressed by this cooler My search criteria where as follows Metal hinges had an old Igloo with plastic hinges finally blow out on me granted it was a 30yr old cooler so props to Igloo Metal handles Solid handle andor locking mechanism Hard lined and oring sealed The Coleman SteelBelted Cooler fit all of these criteria and was available for the modest price of 80 I deemed the 54 quart to be of substantial size based on the can capacity that is listed in the description I love that Coleman knows their customers and knows we will want to know how many beerI mean soda cans that the cooler can fit Trust me folks Ive beaten this thing up to heck and back on my camp trips and it has performed admirably It can take a hit and keep on going washed of easily with a hose the hard lining wipes out quickly with a paper towel and it kept my ice frozen for 2 days straight Also is a sturdy seat option for when your idiot cousin steals your chair at the campfire 
perfect size for 4 day family camping Sturdy great looking Impressive insulating ability great lookingI wish it had lockshasps to better ward off racoons Reasonable weightsome super coolers that cost 400 are 35 lbs EMPTY 
This RED cooler is awesome Not an oversized but perfect for the beach or poolside The red color made it better than any other cooler that could do the same job Couldnt beat the price 
Bought for my husband to replace our old plastic cooler Havent used it yet but seems to be of very good quality 
Looks awesome locks well holds a lot but doesnt keep ice as long as the cheap plastic coolers Really disappointed 
Greetings AmericaI received this for a Christmas gift  while Ive NOT used it just yet the pics of this online DONT do it justice This cooler is a real beauty You cannot go wrong w a RED cooler especially being a Louisville Cardinals FAN I will update once I use it Until then my FriendsHappy New YearsCHEERS 
cool retro 
Great product Quick shipping 
Not your typical cheesy badminton set I was set on not getting the same poor quality sets that we used to have when I was a kid that barely make it through the summer and this is it This set is very impressive from the netting to the posts to how easy it was to set up It also has the boundary rope so you know when its out of bounds 
Very pleased Quality item Fast shipping Thanks 
Takes two in the wind to put it up Slightly small but fine for 2 small kids Put cooler on it to keep from flying away Stakes useless Even used inside sand pockets 
Perfect for our beach vacation with a newborn But it does take 2 to put it up or 1 very frustrated person 
It leaks and the nozzle isnt the greatest Its better than nothing but I wasnt blown away 
LOL I did try this at a campground and I love the concept but not super easily used 
The handle from Which you hang the bag to shower is made of crappy plastic so it breaks easily Ours didnt last long before the handle split in half and we had to balance it over a stairwell to shower Cheap design wont last 
love it 
Worked great for camping at Coachella Gets pretty heavy when full so if you have to carry it a way to get to camp have someone with you or something to pull it in Water gets hot thats for sure 
Kept the ice frozen for a long time wish it were slightly bigger though especially for the price Probably would have been just as happy with a cheaper one 
This is so cool 
I love this cooler I was looking for something with a kind of retro look and stumbled upon this one The design is simple and sleek and really does do justice to the original style Coleman coolers of yesteryear Ive only used the cooler a handful of times thus far and the ice retentioninsulation properties seem to be pretty good Im not taking this thing on a rafting trip or some sort of expedition so it doesnt have to be bomb proof which a lot of people have complained about Absolutely fine for tailgating and car camping Will keep everything cold for multiple days more so if you pack the cooler properly and arent continually going in and out of it Based on others reviews I will be more careful with the hinges and clasp to ensure that that doesnt break because it sounds as if that is the one downfallweakness of this design I purchased this cooler at halfprice because it was on sale  dont know that I would have paid the sticker price for it but Im completely happy with it as is 
Not really too difficult to assemble The back vent is great because otherwise it gets on the warm side Great piece that makes my beach trips a lot more enjoyable 
the first time we set this up we messed up the orientation I found it pretty confusing to set it up because it just feels like a mess of flaps and fabric but after getting it down and opening it up it was fantastic it blocked the sun it was large enough for 4 of us 2 adults and 2 children it provided plenty of shade im not sure how the material will hold up but weve used it twice and its doing great so far 
does what it is supposed to difficult but not impossible for one person to set up 
rackets are a little cheap but the set is nice 
works great 
Great 
When the zombies attack and we have no electricity Ill still get to enjoy hot showers with this product 
Great for the price Love this when tent camping while 4 wheeling Shower in a bag for 10 Deal 
these things are great for camping and this is the best price you will findbeats wallyworld by a few bucks 
This is a great sunshade if you want to take on a trip The packed size will allow you to fit it into luggage Ive set it up twice by myself Neither time was windy and it took about 10 minutes each time You do need to be careful when sliding the poles through as the fabric that the poles slide through is a netting and I can see someone ripping the netting if they tried to force the poles through The sand bags are nice to have and very useful For a family of 5 2 adults 3 kids its a tight fit but for 3 its very comfortable Its not a problem for me as weve never had all 5 in the shade at the same time Weve used with the back screen up and it wasnt unbearably hot For the price I think its a good buy 
Nice cooler but very heavy when loaded Kept ice for 48 hours while on a road trip I wanted a basket for the top and found IKEA has a metal tray that fits perfectly providing a nice area for sandwiches and squishy items 
This was advertised as used acceptable It had one tiny dent in the top and seemed brand new otherwise and was priced less than half of a new one Very happy 
Great Cooler reminds me of a cooler my parents had growing up Very durable and keeps ice all day no problem The latch works great in the back of a rzr trail riding 
As many other reviewers mentioned this is a high quality set It is sturdy and withstood kids running into it and pulling on the net for about nine hours of consistent use at a graduation party Smaller kids used it for volleyball with a rubber kickball and the net totally handled it The only reason I do not give it five stars is because the birdies completely fell apart to the point that the kids had to stop playing as there was nothing left to hit The ends are made of cork and disintegrated Other than that I am totally pleased and do recommend it None of the racquets broke I really like the bag it comes with for storage as there is enough room to add extra racquets 
Bought this to go in my RV after purchasing a very cheap one that fell apart This one is terrific Sturdy rackets are nice 
Set up in 5 min Excellent quality Well made and worth every penny 
After my last camping trip the site didnt have water so hauling the water jug is annoying Glad to have had the soapy water and clean water saved a lot of time effort and water Awesome buy 
I really despised this Coleman PVC sink and it now lives in my bin of rejected and unloved camping gear I gave it a chance but it is too small to be useful and very unstable With hot water it feels like a childs pool toy thats been left out in the sun It was a waste of money It wont last and will soon end up in a landfill There are far better products out therenbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefSeattleSportsPackSinksdpB0007RSG52refcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTF8Seattle Sports Pack Sinksanbspare larger and tougher I use two of them when car camping It costs more but it works and makes the whole camping experience that much more enjoyable Problem solved You dont need to settle for this chintzy and cramped little piece of junk Spend a little more for something that works and that you can depend on Go big or stay home 
We use this basin for the 2nd season and find out that it is an excellent product very durable and convinient  
Great shade for my fair skinned children at the beach this summer Easy to put up My littlest one was able to retreat from the sun and wind for a nap It also gave shelter from the seagulls while we are lunch 
Bought this for use on the beach I have a hard time staying out in the sun for more than an hour unlike my wife and we now have an infant with us got this shade mostly for him This worked fantastic I will admit that sand will get inside of this so with that in mind if yo u are looking for purely a beach shade and can deal with sand I would look into a bottomless shade If you plan on using this anywhere else I highly recommend this shade My only issues with this are it was sometimes difficult threading the rods through their channels and same with removing them The material would bunch up and catch I have ripped a small hole in the mesh channel likely from the install portion Overall fantastic 
Got this since were always going to San Diego and figured itd be nice to have some shade while on the beach This is pretty easy to setup however can be a bit of a challenge when theres a lot of wind During the first time we set it up one of the rod ends got caught in the mesh pocket for it and tore a little hole in the mesh This isnt a deal breaker but maybe a new redesign should use the same material for the rod pockets instead of mesh since this is more durable Weve since bought a different easy up canopy which is much faster but still use this one as well 
great to have when in a pinch 
em arrived in perfect condition is what is described in the purchase thanks 
pro set 
Awesome sturdy cooler that wont break the bank 
I love this cooler This is my second one The first one got ran over by a truck Long story 
It does the job at a reasonable price 
I finally had to replace my old plastic cooler and this fits the bill for a stronger longlasting product I really like the easyopen and close lock on it and while Im not entirely convinced its worth the price I paid its a very good cooler Amazon had the best price after I looked around 
keeps ice longer than vintage ones 
Nothing comes between me the outdoors and a fresh shower This is fantastic nothing like feeling so fresh and so clean in the great outdoors 
Surprisingly durable design and even has small pockets for storage In all honesty the heating element to this I didnt have experience with it was so hot where we camped we didnt care about waiting to test out the solar capabilities 
Tube slightly above bottom leaves water that doesnt let out from shower head Otherwise decent Head seems a bit cheap but its holding up so far Hope it continues 
Ive never managed to get the water to heat up much Also the hose started leaking after just one use I managed to fix it with duct tape so Im still using it I usually fill this with water and hang from a tree for washing dishes hands etc and it works well enough for that but I cant imagine actually using it as a shower You should also consider that the bag is very heavy when full and it needs to be hung high off the ground to be functional so its usually an awkward twoperson job 
The best beach tent Very solid and perfect for a couple and a baby 
Great quality easy to setup take down bag is large enough to easily put everything back into it Everything in one 
Very nice and seems to be well made Only problem is you have to hang it very high to get it to work properly I did not have a ladder when camping so had to shower on my knees 
I purchased this to lay on the deck of my boat however the push in fill caps leak when its laid down If youre able to hang it up then youll be happy otherwise buy the Stearns with the screw on fill cap 
Excellent 
This cooler is well built and I expect Ill get years of service out of it The only thing I dislike is the latch for the lid It doesnt cam over the same way the old ones did tightening the lid as it locked into place It also doesnt have a bottle opener like the old models but seriously weve all went to twist top bottles and plastic anyway 
When comparing prices with the new super coolers I went with the old standby for 15 the price Glad I did It works good enough and I dont have to lock it in my car for fear of theft The lid doesnt tighten down and there is little adjustment but thats the only downer 
The only thing giving this a four in my review is the latch I gave this as a gift to my parents so Ive been out on excursions and used this cooler with them The latch isnt like the old ones It doesnt cam over in the same manner and doesnt pull the lid down tight It also doesnt have the bottle opener like the old ones but really who uses bottles without twist tops anyways 
awesome 
Like others have said the current Crescent 15 Degree F bag being sold is a mediumdark blue and charcoal color not lime green and charcoal as pictured The blue panels are diamondrip stop polyester taffeta and the charcoal parts do not appear to be ripstop Its filled with 2 lbs 14 oz of Coletherm hollow core poly fill insulation The net pack weight the bag in the stuff sack is just over 4 lbs I bought two and one weighed 4 lb 05 oz and the other 4 lb 18 oz on a postal scale The stuff sack weights 25 oz so the sleeping bag alone weighs just under 4 lbs which is a good ruleofthumb maximum limit for a sleeping bag to take backpacking It easily can keep you comfortable down to the 15 degree F rating This bag is very compressible for its loft The size in the included stuff sack is 10 diameter and 14 long which most people will find to be an odd size for backpacking However it will fit stuffed into 11001200 cubic inch backpack compartments It easily fits in an 9 x 24 compression sack not included and squeezes down to approx 9 x 17 pack size if you want to attach it outside your pack For the priceweight this bag is a great buy for both general camping and lighttomedium backpacking for 3season use by Boy Scouts Although it is true you can get goosedown bags for the same temperature range that are about 1 lb lighter and more compressible for hardcore backpacking Im generally opposed to down bags for Boy Scouts for several reasons a down is outrageously expensive especially given the likelihood of some rough treatment and short lifespan b a down bag is useless if it gets wet and c they require special cleaning or special soap for home washing My only complaints are that the shell isnt 100 ripstop material and the included stuff sack is an odd size but at a price around 40 bucks both can be forgiven 
Backpacking on the cheap thats how I roll No really I am basically a beginner on a tight budget so Im on the prowl for deals I scoured Amazon and I settled for this Coleman Crescent bag because well Coleman is a name Ive trusted for years Id never heard of the other brands and I really didnt know exactly what I was looking for Not long after I ordered the bag I realized it was supposedly for tall people which I certainly am not Then after talking to my Uncle who has been backpacking for 20 years I started to worry about the 52 pound listed weight of the bag All my fears were for naught though because when the bag arrived I immediately saw that it wasnt the same bag Yes it was a Coleman Crescent but it was blue with a completely different design on the front it was normal sized and it weighed less then 25 pounds It easily fit into the stuff sack and fit perfectly into my 3500 Cuscus Backpack I will warn you however that this bag looks like it will only fit into bigger packs as in 85 litres and higherNeedless to say I spent the entire month of August humping this bag into the mountains up here in the great white north of Washington State It probably only dipped into the low 40s or high 30s at the lowest but I was so hot some nights I had to strip off thermals in the middle of the night As a matter of fact every single time ive used this bag I had to partially unzip it because I woke up in the night too hot So to recap 1The bag isnt too expensive 2The bag they send you is better then the bag described 3 It is fairly lightweight and should fit into or under your large pack or easily strap onto an external frame Ive done both with it 4It keeps you warm at night Winter is around the corner so I should test the 15 degree rating as I backpack deep into fall but Im guessing it will do alright The only knock I have is that there isnt any room to move your legs I know its a mummy bag and all but dang the legs are a little too snug Up next get rid of my 4000 4man dome tent that Im packing in everywhere 
Once I figured out how to lay out the square for the court with the supplied rope it all made sense Great fun but tricky setup first time We play so much that we have to move it around to keep the grass from getting killed 
Very good product Easy to assemble and use Comes with a handy bag for storage I was looking for exactly such a product for my yard for a nice game and practice and some workouts The rackets are not great but you can very well use to play or use your own favorite one The shuttle cork though made of plastic works pretty well and gets a decent flight The best part is the assembly which is so easy The net stands out firm and strong and you can adjust the tension easily The set can also withstand sun and rain  we had it on the yard for weeks before we got it packed when it started snowing 
Great product overall used for a 5 day backpacking trip in Arizona Everything was going great we enjoyed a few nice hot showers and were happy we purchased it The problem came on the last day when while filing it a hole burst in the seam Nothing I couldnt fix with some thread and gorilla glue but enough to trash it when we got home After looking closely it looks like it wasnt so much bad design as it was a defect in our unit Thats why I am giving it 3 stars instead of 0 since I think it was just a defect in our unit and otherwise it worked great 
Good product Lack of instructions and it took us some thinking how to switch it on and off pull the shower head 
easy to use 
Trusted Seller would recommend 
Good product 
I bought these for emergency purposes and they are just as described and will work very well for us 
We purchased the volleyball system and this is the same high quality Easy to assemble and a good bag for carrying it Highly recommend 
We use this cooler when we grocery shop to store our meat and cold items until we get home Plenty of room 
great 
I used this many times camping this past summer Handy item 
Packs up in small pack thus takes up less room on boat Holds up great in windy conditions Highly recommend would buy again 
A little difficult to put up and will never stay in place with stakes supplied However very good quality product Works well on the beach 
Used the Shade this weekend Fast to set up and it is very convenient Hard to roll back on the case if you are on the beach 
Back back worked very well I am a cold natured person and with 3 young boys 1 already in cub scouts I see alot of camping in my future I ordered this back pack right before our cub adventure camping trip Little nervous as I completely froze last year My whole upper body stayed very warm My legs and feet on the other hand were still a little cold My husband says I will need to make some clothing adjustments until I find what works for me But very satisified with it after 1 use 
I got this bag for a three season budget backpacking bag I slept in about 57 degrees farenheit in soccer shorts and a t shirt I was warm enough to partially unzip the bag Other reviews suggest using it in colder temps which is definitely something Ill try At around 4lb Its at the upper limit for a backpacking bag but it compresses pretty well with a better stuff sack The bag is very thick I cant speak to durability but I have a feeling that it will last if given the right care I love the ability to cinch down the hood The only complaint I have and it is minor is that it is difficult to zip from the inside due to the insulated liner covering the zipper There is an internal zipper pull its just difficult to work Im willing to deal with that though because it will keep me warmer when needed 
Exactly as expected Works great 
Just what I needed 
Actually great for rinsingwashing camp dishes and utensils  And cleaning hands and face 
Alot of fun had with this already Great quality and easy to assemble 
this was a gift for our daughters family with a 9 yr old 8 yr old and 4 yr old as well as Mom and Dad After it arrived i said did you get the badminton set I went into the back yard and my daughter had already set it up It is very well made  all equipment sturdyI recommend this highly 
This is a very solid product for the most part I have had this for several years now and enjoy it thoroughly My only complaint about this set is the rackets They are very cheap rackets and have worn out after only few uses 
nicely made 
Pros lightweight folds down good for camping Cons Be very careful when washing sharp objects The thin plastic walls can damage easily 
Really handy for camping Super compact and a great value 
Great buy once you fill it with water it keeps its shape Reason to the four stars it arrived with a hole on one side Was already at the campsite when I found the problem Took some fire and sealed it by burning it Been camping with it several times since then still holding 
This cooler is so fantastic that we bought another one I love the steel on the outside convenient drain plug and matches all your Coleman things It looks retro but has all the modern amenities you could possibly want out of a cooler We had drinks and ice in it used it frequently one night and 4 days later opened it up and there were still a few small pieces of ice 
This works well The water does slowly seep from side to the other though 
Awesome for camping Washing dishes are so much better with 2 compartments 
Love this for camping It folds up to be very compact and it lightweight 
Bought 2 for Girl Scout Camporee Worked well No leaks dries quickly stores easily It was a bit difficult to fill with water and then carry to washing station as there is no bottom support 
This was a great idea butI sat it on a bench when I heated up water then added it to the tubs when the plastic got warm it did not stand up The top of the tubs have a nice frame that frames the top but the bottom folds up and the plastic turns to jelly Not user friendly 
would like it to be more durable 
i bought this one for an emergency situation its looks strong enough to be hung with 5 gl of water but I will not now until i really tray it I will update later after our regular summer camp 
valve pops off when hot the plastic seal is not great 
Amazed at how fast the water gets warm in the sun 
Great 
I had one of these back in 1965 they hold up for ever this a be the last cooler youll ever buy made very well And very strong 
Not made like the old classic ones Latch is a cheap plastic piece that had already fallen out in to the shipping box Weirdly enough the screws were all stripped too 
Delivered on timelooks great cant wait to put it to usemetal hinges and metal latch 
great for the beach lightweight and fits on my bike rack perfectly 
Easy to set up if you have a little experience at setting up tents Was the envy of the ocean best buy of the year 
I bought this hoping it would keep my infant cooler and out of the sun at the beach It was unbearable inside even with the doors open Bag zipper broke the first day Impossible to get the tent back into the storage bag Good luck getting tent stakes to work in the sand 
took awhile to put up but it is nice 
Great 
bought it for my daughter nice sink 
Returned Bins are much smaller than the picture will make you think Decided to just use the storage containers we are packing our stuff in to wash dishes Problem solved 
Bought as a gift 
Dont be dirty when your camping this thing is great Saves me money too at festivals In fact helped me sleep with 2 girls at the last one 
Bought it for camping but it is January so we will have to wait and see if the water heats up at a decent rate but either way this isnt my first coleman solar shower bag and I am certain that this one will last as long as the last one10 years 
Nice way to conserve water from the faucet and use in the garden 
Great set with equipment 
Easy setup although the plastic stacks are very weak and I had to use some wooden ones Also the border line comes up short 
The racquets are cheaply made but the net and poles are great 
I am very pleased with the quality of this set I ordered it after reading some positive reviews and was not disappointed It was easy to set up and has been a lot of fun I really like that it comes with a carrying bag and the outline for the court 
Poles are fine net rope and case are good Rackets are cheap plastic handles which had the end caps loose in the box and had to put back on Packaging is non existent with everything just put loose in a shipping box Have had much better rackets in cheaper sets Not worth the price paid 
This was a total disappointment I should have listened to the reviews I read before buying this They warned that there were leaks but I thought maybe those people just got a bad one Well turns out they must be all bad Because this one immediately started leaking as well The seams just arent sewn tightly enough to hold water We did find a workaround by filling a trash bag with water and laying the bag inside the basin So we were still able to use it but we shouldnt have had to use this work around 
Excellent product Prompt shipping 
This thing works great In a calm day easy to set up one person I would suggest two Do a dry run at house to familiarize yourself with it Its as big as my Coleman two person tent Lots of room and can be a changing room Typical Coleman quality  if you take care of it  it will last a long time 
Havent used it yet but seems to be very well made 
do not buy a 10 gallon one You wont be able to lift it These are perfect 
Not a bad price This is a fantastic one time use product Its nearly impossible to dry out for a second use though Water just stays in there and makes it nasty 
Great deal on this shower I have two now and will use it in conjunction with my portable shower enclosure when we go camping and have a group that needs a shower Oftenhehehe 
Great Product 
A lot less water pressure than I expected 
We bought this cooler because we loved the memories that it held It really is a good cooler when used in the environment it was designed for Online now to order a second one 
My wife thought this was a dumb purchase and after we practiced setting it up in the living room she felt that it was way too large and would be obnoxious to set up on a busy beach OCMD I insisted that I was going to take it to the beach and use it and if she didnt like it then she would be under no obligation to get in it or make it known that she was with me It turns out she loves it more than I did  the set up and tear down is easy once you practice takes about 5 minutes and it offers a sense of security since you can put your belongings in it and zip it up Great shelter from the sun and with the back flap open a nice ocean breeze runs through it The integrated pockets and laundry line are nice touches Well enjoy this tent for years to come 
Great for watching dishes at base camp Had it for a while and mine now leaks slightly but is still great for washing up Will eventually get another one once the leak gets to bad 
This thing is super flimsy For the same amount of size I recommend getting pop up buckets instead of this thing 
Smaller than expected 
Easily packs down and opens for washing while camping Best design Ive seen for a camping wash basin 
Started leaking between the two sides after maybe 6 uses We were careful with his and did not abuse it Nice idea but poorly made 
Easily packed and pop out as needed 
Works as it should 
Works good 
Funny story so my family was getting ready for a camping trip and my mom started complaining how was she going to take a shower Really well whatever I told her hang on so I went to my local camping store and bought one of these showers I brought it home and I showed her and the look on her face was priceless It worked great not only can you use it to shower but you can also use it to wash dishes to My god was she happyLOL all in all another great product 
aok 
Id give this shade more stars if it wasnt for the poles The poles are a very cheaply made fiberglass type of material On only the 3rd time setting this thing up a pole snapped and splintered on us It was the first day of a 5day beach vacation and we couldnt use this anymore If Coleman would supply aluminum poles this wouldnt happen I wasnt using any excessive force or any use other than what I would consider normal 
Nice Tent BUT very hard to put up specially at the beach IN the wind Broke a rod and made a hole trying to put it together I am not sure how the rod broke but it didsighwas really looking forward to this tent until it took us forever to set up Definitely going to try Pacific Breeze EasyUp Beach Tent instead 
This is doing just what we need giving us enough shade for our little family of 4 Enough room for the one year old to crawl around a bit in the shade and fall asleep I havent been staking it down Just putting our bags in the corners inside and it has held up well to wind 
Its great 
When I took it out of the packaging I thought omg this is too small but when I put water in it it was the perfect size We camped for 10 days and cooked in regular sized pots and pans this basin worked well Its compact but holds a lot of water Another great product by Coleman 
Excellent camping wash bin This was sturdy and well made The plastic was a good thickness I was careful with knives and marshmallow sticks and I filled it on site and didnt try walking around with it or anything but I take care of my things The handles are obviously for just dumping it out I dont know why someone would fill it and then try walking around with it Lol I dont understand what others are complaining about or expected from this Its a collapsible camp basin It does exactly what its expected to But then again Im used to washing up the old fashion way one piece at a time with no basin at all And only one bowl cup and multi utensil per person You know to save space and be efficient Pack it in pack it out 
Great set Easy to set up Pretty wide so youll definitely need a large space to play I like that it comes in a carrying case makes it easy to grab  take to the park Im sure you could get better birdies but the ones that come with the set still work perfectly for us Everything you need to play comes with the set 
The net is really good quality the poles are not to bad and the ropes ties and pegs are good as well However I would rather they reduce the price by 10 and got rid of the truly awful rackets and birdies If you are ordering this then order the other equipemnt at the same time 
Love the set OK for cost No instruction on how to set it up what so ever I know it is not rocket science and we were able to figure it out but still instruction would have definitely saved some time 
I bought this as a present for my nephew and he loved it It is well built and strong Worth it 
Best cooler ever 
Very nice cooler Sturdy and good looking Just as described 
Seems to keep the ice from melting pretty well The latch could be a little more heavy duty Took it on a camping trip Under normal use it will get dinged and the dings dont go away 
We took this cooler along for a 25 hour road trip to Montana The cooler is sleek a little heavy but kept ice for several days and then icy burn your hand cold water for a few more Very happy 
Cheaply made Handle broke first time use 
option to adjust the flow of water would be great otherwise it works very well 
I use it for hand cleaning and dish washing around camp I would assume after it heats up it would be good for a short shower 
I bought this for our week long camping trip as I anticipated long days at the beach So glad we have it Easy to set up just a few minutes by myself great shelter to take a break from the sun or catch a nap in I could lie down in it with my son when he fell asleep inside 
This beach shade was nice once set up however it was difficult to set up once at the beach despite two previous practice sessions at home My kids didnt want to sit inside of it because they werent in the sand and it was blocked off by walls on three sides I do however see it as a very useful shade for younger kidsespecially for napping purposes My kids range from preschool to late elementary school thus it wasnt a good fit for our family 
Im not sure if mine was a second or something but the green die had come off all over the grey areas of the tent You could definitely see large areas of transfer that made the whole thing ugly so I sent it back Also It is more of a pain to put together than I would want for something youll put up and down for just a few hours of use each time 
This is amazing We bought it for a trip to the beach It takes a little while to get it in terms of assembling but once you get it it is very easy Some tips 1 Put it in the sand wide open and put some bags with sand they come with the tent so that the wind doesnt bother you 2 Put first the black pieces and then the grey one it is much easier 3 Once you have the structure in place open the windows so that it doesnt blow with the wind and put the bags of sand inside the tent since it makes it easier to put the stakes in the sand It is also very easy to disassemble it is very light Not hot inside My baby took great naps inside It is great that it has a floor to keep the sand out Since it has two openings in the front and back it doesnt get too hot inside 
Replacing our 30 year old Coleman metal cooler Did not think that our old faithful cooler could be replaced by something comparable but I was mistaken This is a wellmade beauty of a cooler that is worth each and every dollar 
For years we went cheap thought the coolers we bought werent really that much cheaper But we finally got what weve wanted all along and are so lad we did Well built hold ice longer than any other cooler were owned and holds a lot even though it looks smaller than our others We recently had a party and we used this along with 2 other coolers Ice lasted much longer in this than the other 2 So glad we finally got a Coleman 
Purchased as a gift 
A must after two days 
Works as described 

we love this for camping 
this is a nice badminton set we have had a blast playing in the yard the net is good quality and braces well The spikes are a little flimsy but theyre easy enough to replace note that I dont think this is interchangeable with a volleyball net because its too low 
Nice tent roomy size but too much assembly hassle for a beach trip A popup version would be ideal 
works great just used it for a music festival I have a small twoperson tent for sleeping in We set this up alongside our twoperson tent in order to use for storage and to sometimes get ourselves out of the sun Also since all we have is a small twoperson tent for sleeping it was nice to have this available as a changing room You can stand up in it granted you may have to hunch over a little 
More than I needed I really just wanted a pop upquick sun shade to take to Destin with us but I also wanted something that would withstand the ocean breeze While this one worked quite well it took a bit too much effort to set up so we ended up buying a 9 dollar beach umbrella at a surf shop that really suited us better If you need a place to lay a baby down of change clothes this would be a good option but Id perfer something simpler just for shade 
Great product Keeps ice for days Love it Bought for my husband got our tenth anniversary tin gift 
Well built and insulated but does not include the classic and essential dry food storage trays 
On a typical camping trip in the summer it will keep 2 bags of ice about 36 hours It is well made and performs about like we thought it would Its not over rated like a YETI I talked to a fellow camper just last week The days were in the upper 90s and the nights in the mid 70s he claimed he got about 2 full days before buying more ice Even after about 48 hours the Coleman still was very cold inside although for all practical purposes the ice was done 
Everyone wanted there own It was easiest way to clean up when camping 
I used this for tent camping because we didnt have a sink It is perfect because it folds up for travel and storage I love that it has a wash and rinse side When we were done we just hung it to dry 
got a hole in after we dumped water in it was a waste of money 
Works just like it should no complaints 
Leaked from the spout right away Big piece of crp  
I recommend this set for the net only then buy your own racket  shuttlecock Its easy to set up no problems 
I read the negative comments on this set but there were many more positive comments so I purchased it thinking I would sent it back if not high quality Well it is high quality for the price I am very satisfied The poles are durable and easy to set up The rackets are great I highly recommend this affordable set 
Great price and excellent quality Setup is a snap and the poles and net are durable I would definitely recommend this product 
We used this at the beach for the first time over 4th of July weekend and give it two thumbs up It was easy to setup large enough for multiple people and kept us dry through an impromptu rain shower at the beach It was even large enough for 1 adult and 6 kids 16yrs old to huddle in during the rain shower  I really like the window for ventilation and nice little clothes line for drying The only con I have is difficulty fitting it back in the original bag but that is not a default of the product just comes with the territory of putting things back in the original packaging As other reviewers mentioned it was a lot easier to setupbreakdown with the help of 2 people It wasnt a windy day so we were able to forgo using the stakes and sandbags but great it has those options 
Great item Was a gift for my dad and he loved it 
Well built good looking updated classic cooler 
Is well made and a great ice chest 
This item is a must for campers Light weight and packs well 
Works Great Thanks 
The quality of this product is not what I was expecting from Coleman I dont think this will make 1 full camping trip without splitting one of the sides As soon as I purchased it the price dropped from 1489 to 350 The cost to return it is almost 600 Guess Im stuck with it Dont waist your money Had a chance to use this over the weekend You could only put and item or 2 in there at one time Trying to empty it was very cumbersome Like even less then I did before using it 
A nice luxury for our month long camping trip This allowed me to easily wash dishes with my little helper After dinner we simply boiled another pot of water on the fire and added it to cold water to avoid melting it so we could clean dishes easily It folds up small and the handles are sturdy to haul from sink to camp if needed 
Very nice quality just have to make sure its hung very high 
Pros The net poles stakes and roping are all of good quality at this price Im very pleased with them Cons The rackets and birdies are of the usual poor quality to be expected from low end Badminton sets And like all the others the wrapping came loose from the handles of two of the rackets on the very first game Overall Im please mostly because I can buy better rackets and birdies to replace these 
I started with a set from KMart that had a rip in the net and one of the poles broken This set cost twice as much but the net was in tact the rackets are top quality and setting up was super easy My only complaint is that the net is quite low Most sets at this price range can be used for badminton AND volleyball but this net is far too low for volleyball Still the quality is great and well worth the price 
This basin is great especially if youre camping at a site without water Works as a dishwashing station but could also work as a hand washing station as well Folds up for easy storage too It is large enough to hold a frying pan too 
Smaller then I thought but it did the trick and it collapses so nicely to be compact 
Perfect for car camping 
Very useful Having a facility to get hot water makes this a good container to transport and wash in 
Have not use but like how foldable 
Looks great and very functional I love it Worth the price 
What a great beachpicnic shelter Sure its a few more minutes worth of effort than the umbrella style but its more convenient doesnt have the pole and is very well constructed 
It works fine and provides shade but we were disappointed in the color We ordered the orange color and it looks nothing like the photo Its actually yellow 
Its huuuuuuuge Way bigger than expected but thats probably due to my lack of research Plan to spend time setting it up like a tent I ended up paying to return it and getting a simpler product 
Finally got a chance to use this I am absolutely in love It was fairly easy to put up and looked great Two of us were able to easily fit inside The tent poles are longer than most which is a big advantage Some of the ones Ive seen had shorter poles causing the ends of the tent to lift up slightly This one was barely a wobble until we were ready to leave The only downside is fitting the tent back it the case after use That took a bit of finagling but we managed This is an excellent tent well worth the money 
I am gonna wash my balls with this 
WORKS GREAT 
love it  good condition as showed 
Do yourself a favor Instead of this flimsy product buy 3 Rubbermaid or similar dishwashing basins They come in red black and white They nest inside of each other to save space Use the black for washing red for rinsing and the white for sanitizing capful of bleach in water Scouts have been doing it this way forever and it works 
While the Cabana is everything its described to be Setup is more tedious than it needs to be We returned it and bought the Lightspeed Outdoors Quick Cabana in its place We were originally attracted to the Coleman because it had the greatest head room But we didnt factor in the 8 lip for zipping up the front panel which effectively lowers the head height to be about the same as the Lightspeed And the Lightspeed is wider and sets up in a snap literally you simply push to pieces toward each other and bam its up Much better when on a windy beach 
Love it easy to put up and easy to pack away 
Really smelly PVC product Requires sitting in the sun for days for the smell to reduce Safe  
Works as advertised Will be replacing the hose maybe 2 feet long with something much longer 
Perfect for the beach Have used it twice now and love it 
Once you get past the initial look of complication youll realize its incredibly easy to put up Not as easy as a pop up of course but it only took a few mins and it was definitely everything we wanted in a beach shade However I took away one star because folding it back up to place in the carry bag wasnt as simple as Id like it to be It just folded rather messy 
If you are going to be taking your family camping this is an essential item The classic green Coleman cooler 
used once on a canoe race to clean up after worked but not a lot of flow awkward on and off 
Works well and compact 
So nice to have and easy to store 

Pretty nifty sun tent for taking with to the beach Assembly took some time roughly 710 minutes first time use but was easy breezy One note though inside the tent gets pretty muggy even with the back window vent open So Unless theres a decent breeze flowing it can get a little uncomfortable hanging out in there Outside however underneath the shaded roof feels wonderful and blocks out the sun Woohoo 
Good quality but I would have liked setup to be easier Takes 1015 minutes to set up partially because the poles continually snag on the fabric when threading them through 
Best beach purchase 
This tent rocks Well designed for the beach and can be used as a regular tent too 
item was as described 
Gets the dirt off 
I got these in a bundle with some Coleman kitchen set and was disappointed by the small size and cheap material Not at all what I have come to expect from Coleman They work so 2 stars but expected more from Coleman 
Very useful and easy to pack 
This was smaller than I anticipated my own fault for not looking closely at the specs One of the seams came apart on the first use Although we could still use it it wasnt as study Im looking to buy something different for my next trip 
The Coleman folding wash basin was on my list for quite some time but I never got around to buying it This basin is lightweight and collapsible for storage and will make washing dishes a little easier 
Only have used it once so far and it worked well It folds down compactly and hasnt had a tear yet 
Love t 
Perfect fill it out halfway and in a one hour in the sun you have hot water to take a shower Just bring a long rope to hang it high above your head And if you can bring a false wood floor so the water drains down otherwise youll be standing on a puddle of water 
Reminds me of my childhood So far so good No complaints 
Coleman has a long and rock solid reputation as the king of car camping But theyve really let themselves slack Ive owned this cooler for close to a decade now and honestly its not that good The lid doesnt stay shut The drain hole has a pathetic little plug and not a screw cap The handles are weak and bend easily And most importantly it doesnt seem to keep things cold very well Its great for short simple things like running to the grocery store but thats about it The Coleman Xtreme coolers do a better job of keeping things cold but they arent that great either 
Great for camping 
Perfect addition to our camp kitchen I like that it has 2 sides 
took camping and it did great 
Used this a few times now  love it Easy  compact to bring camping Folds up nicely Great  roomy for washing dishes anywhere 
Nuf said 
If it works for one season I will be happy I wash the dishes 
Great for camping tripsno more trying to wash dishes at the common faucet Two compartmentsfolds for easy packingvery lightweight 
Oh man I shopped and shopped ALL these types of products for something for our 12 month old twins to use on the beach and this was perfect Great shelter for the four of us all day then when it was time for their nap we just zipped up the front halfway so they couldnt get out and they slept in there I do agree with other reviews that said it got hot in there  that it could certainly use more ventilation  which is very true Needs more areas that open up to mesh so that kids are still contained but air can get through Luckily we werent on the beach on a boiling hot day so it wasnt a huge deal for us but I wouldnt take babieskids to the beach on a boiling hot day anyway so I guess this is going to work just fine for us I like that it could also be used for camping too if we wanted 
This set is way more durable than the other cheaper sets which usually only last one season in the sun before they start to fade and dry rot I have had this net up for most of one year and it still looks new The only thing you will need to do is maybe replace an occasional plastic stake which you can buy any tent stake set for cheap or get metal ones 
Its a colemanwhat else needs to be said A name brand that has stood its test of time and one I will always buy Good price 
This was on sale  Christmas but the order got messed up So ended up paying a little more Still 90 less than in our area Great cooler Just threw away my first steelbelted cooler Had to be at least 50 years old It would still keep things cold for a week or more but leaked 
Good deal wlightning deal Very nice cooler Now I wanted some super cool stickers to put on it Love the green color This will be our new beer cooler 
I am not totally satisfied The item needs a drain plug It is very difficult to drain the wash water with out making a mess 
Great Coleman quality works great 
Badminton is a great sport can be faster than tennis but cheap sets usually wind up with the racquet strings parting to snag the shuttlecock or birdie very annoying This set while not a pro set functions well and has served us for several weeks without a failure or racquet becoming unusable and no signs that it will deteriorate any time soon so it gets a good rating The net is easy to set up and functions well the allimportant critical racquets are decent We are happy Reasonably priced 
Made dishes while camping soooo much easier Even the boys could do them lol Love this little guy We bought a second 
Excellent product for cleaning camp site dishes Accidentally ordered two and gave one to a friend Would recommend this product 
I havent had a chance to use it but I did assemble it to see how easy it would be to assemble Its easy to assemble and it is pretty big 
I used this on the outskirts of a town in Morocco now fear if I had used it out in the sand dunes Id be a dead man This is not made with any sense of durability or longlasting intent in mind I was only ten miles from Taroudant a Moroccan city in the Sous Valley in the southern part of the country on a hike I took this Road Trip Beach Shade and about 2 gallons of water Well it broke as soon as I made a day camp in which to rest It has the most useless parts ever put together I waited until nightfall and then walked back under the temps of about 100F Its worthless 
I works well You need to have a means to tie it to a tree I used paracord The nossle leaks when closed so you will want to make sure its pointed up at all times 
Works great 
Awesome product  delivery time was clear and delivered on time 
Awesome classic cooler 
latch broke first day 
latch broke day 1 
pure junk cracked open 
Still using this 
perfect 
It so works as a tent as well it was easy to put up and it fits one person with room to spare Loved it 
Good quality not amazing but you shouldnt expect amazing at this price This has held up in moderate winds at the beach and at parks Only had one problem the zipper strings fell off when pulling on them Use some pilers to make sure they stay on 
I already own one of these but wanted another one I am disappointed but dont have the time or energy to send this back The red part that turns the water on and off doesnt work at all You cant turn it so you dont get any water The bag itself is fine it just needs that part replaced 
Love this cooler It fits SO much inside of it and stays cold for long periods of time 
Nice cooler  all strapped in the RZR and ready to go 
one of the better looking coolers using mine for an indoor kept cigar coolidor though so wanted something with a little style 
This beach shade is excellent I love it It is easy to put together once you figure out which bar goes where My bf and I brought this to the beach today and I didnt get sunburn Near 45pm it was getting windy and it holds up well I only give four stars because the bag that it comes is small if you dont fold it tight it wont fit in the bag My bf and I had to fold it twice to make it fit in the small bag 
If you plan to use your badminton set much spend the extra money and get a decent set like this It is quite sturdy relatively easy to assemble and a lot of fun It also comes with a nice carry bag that makes it easy to take it on holiday 
Average quality set handle wrapping coming apart after only 5 games It is hard to find a good badminton set now days 
This has worked for our camping needs for 3 years now We go up to Big Sur every august for a week  some other random camping trips throughout the year One of the seams did slightly start to tear so we now use that side for rinsing and make sure NOT to lift this up when its full of water It is made of a plastic vinyl that will rip on the corners and seams 
Handy item for when you are camping and dont have anywhere to wash dishes Ive used this a lot and after a year of frequent use it is still in great shape without holes 
Holds a ton of water 
I got this because it folds flat I used it 3 times before the side split open I imagine because there is no drainage system so two people picking up by all handles and dumping puts stress on the seams Save money and buy the 99 tubs 
Works pretty well but the plastic will crack pretty quickly I did a field repair with duct tape and it worked fine 
Grease just hangs onto the plastic thus the sink never gets clean 
I have purchased three of these showers None of them have lasted more than a few days They always split near wear the hose connects to the bag and render the whole thing useless I dont reccomend them   
Budget shower bag works well on warm days Would buy again 
This handsome and sturdy Coleman cooler is over all a better product than our similar Coleman chest it has replaced That chest lasted for at least fifteen years of camping trips travel and weekly runs to the grocery store and the meat market The new chest has a tighter seal around the rim and a more positive rotary lock True this cooler is not designed for bouncing around a truck bed Neither is any cooler comparable to a good refrigerator for keeping things cold Shoppers who do not require big and tough coolers holding lots of ice or dry ice for extended trips and who do not want to pay Yeti level prices will find this Coleman cooler to be useful and a reasonable value 
Glad I ponyed up because the style is worth it Latch is sturdy and locks after a full swivel A bit heavy but fits a lot and looks SO SHARP Camping in style  
Great Cooler Looks nice and holds cold very well This is probably one of the best coolers I have ever owned Got on sale from Amazon at 4999 Can really match up with any more expensive coolers 
Delivery was fast Net good quality Rackets medium quality Shuttlecocks very cheap quality I suggest that you automatically buy some spare shuttle cocks I have used the set for about 3 weeks and 1 racket has broke not because of abuse but because of aggressive playing time I would rate this as a good buy for the price 
Have had one of these in use for camping 14 weekends per year and loved the functionality and easy storage So we bought this one as a spare in case the original one ever develops a leak The plastic is soft vinyl so it is easy to puncture with knives or other sharp objects When hot water isused the vinyl softens increasing the potential for puncture But at the price this is a very useful purchase 
despite careful use and a ban on sharp objects it only took 2 camping trips to poke a hole in this So sad 
easy to use and store 
Good idea and concept but we bought this and used it twice and it already has a small hole in one of the sides Wish they made the plastic thicker 
It was a gift for newly wed outdoorsy couple They loved it 
works 
Good size and has a drain Just what I was looking for 
Looks great works great Sturdy handles and a lid that locks 
Great backup for no hot water 
Work great 
I ordered this set recently and have played with it several times now While the poles are sturdy enough and certainly more robust that what is found in cheaper sets the overall package is hardly worth the money in absolute terms I could not find a better set in my online and bm search so I guess I should be happy with a functional product Considering the cost of materials I would say this should be half or one third the price The racquets are average with hard plastic grips Advantage here is that the grip wrap wont come off Disadvantage is that the grips are slick when wet and not very comfortable 
Worked great for one day but during setup on the and day the main support pole broke at the connection and rendered the whole thing basically useless Will try to work with Coleman to get a replacement part 

A 
The front latch is bad Lock it can still open it Love the looks Will look into a latch replacement 
Actually better built than the older model The steel belted lasted about 20 yrs before the plastic on the lower outside started cracking It actually could still be used still water tight 
great cooler looks good has a latch and metal handles that use to strap down the cooler and still have acces to the lid 
Black plastic bag with hose Works fine but nothing special Cheaper than a Mormon hj though 
helped with warm showers 
I have used this Coleman 5Gallon PVC Camp Shower on many occasions while camping in various altitudes in multiple locations at differing weather albeit mostly in spring and summer Basically it works well to heat up water and while the shower head is tiny and water flows slowly it is a great help to have warm showers while camping We also use it for washing dishes as warmer water tends to do the job better However after repeated use it can leak as it did for us so we got new one after many uses But given the low price I think it is worth it  we treat it as a semidisposable product that we can use for many showers but certainly not something that will last forever With realistic expectations you are likely to be pleased 
I saw someone using this exact shower at a music festival where showers cost 10 bucks each and realized how great of an investment it is On a hot summer day you can fill it up with the free water stations and get a clean shower at no cost to you I havent used it enough to see how durable it is so I am giving it 4 of 5 stars 
great 
very convenient when camping 
Works as described 
A bit small but does the job 
How can you go wrong with Coleman 
Great price awesome cooler Thank You Amazon 
3 stars because it looks really cool Ice retention especially on hot days is terrible Forget about using it in the sun on a hot summer day Your ice will melt very quickly The lid doesnt stay closed very well either This is great for fall camping or outdoor parties on cooler days 
I purchased this to turn into a jockey box This is a well made solid cooler which fits great with my 2 120ft stainless coils inside 
Great product so far it works well in Texas Heat I get a full 34 days before I have to replenish the ice It will not keep ice for that long if if is kept in direct sunlight 
This is the second that I have boughten I have the silver one and now that My dad bought a new red Ford I have a cooler for him to match Although the cooler is better built then the truck 
Does exactly what it is intended to do 
Perfect for designed use 
Cheap Does the job The nozzle comes off easily meaning lots of leaks when you arent expecting it Used mainly for cleaning dishes and hands Great for car camping Set up a tripod at the beach to keep it up 
The basin arrived with a tear in one of the sinks needed to use duct tape to fix it up 
My first one came all beat up in the packaging The return via Amazon was very easy The new one was as expected It is about as easy to assemble as a smaller to medium sized common camping tent Im looking forward to using it at the beach this summer Ill add to my review once Ive used it 
I bought this for a long camping trip across country but when it arrived it was clearly not going to work Very flimsy and looks much nicer in the picture I didnt even take it with planning to return it when we got back from our trip but then it was too late Waste of money for sure 
Its smaller then I was hoping But it worked well for the price 
WILL DO THE JOB JUST FINE I WISH IT HAD THREE BINS NICE THOUGH 
This would be good for backpack camping but not sturdy enough for car camping Found the unit flimsy and it tipped over on my daughter while she was washing Spilled right down her legs Its hard enough to get a 13 year old to wash dishes without having to worry about this I washed a sharp knife and had to be too careful not to poke the vinyl 
Worked okay Small than I had expected 
This is a very cool little boat Its fun to use comes with the paddle and is very maneuverable The only drawback is that some water will splash over the sides so youll most likely be sitting in a little puddle The place to stash gear is kind of small but if you keep everything in a drybag you dont have to worry about it getting wet and the cargo net should keep it secure People have mentioned that the paddle can break easily In my opinion thats probably a result of not pushing the metal ends all the way into the black plastic handle parts If you push them in all the way and tighten them down there will be plenty of purchase I cant imagine the paddle breaking under normal use if its put together all the way A longer paddle would be nice though because it will drip on you By the way if you dont inflate the backrest all the way you can make it a little more comfortable for just lounging The only improvements Id like to see are another cargo area behind the seat larger tracking fins more attachment areas so you can tie off to other inflatable boats and a longer paddle but asis its still a great little inflatable boat and lots of fun to use Ive owned this boat for probably 6 or seven years now Ive taken it down the floatable parts of the Yakima River in Washington at least 6 times and also on a handful of other day trips to the lake Its never leaked any air and continues to hold up well 
A good quality cooler love it Looks and functionality galore 
Worth every penny Replaced an old plastic cooler prior to last camping trip with this one and it is so much better Had one almost identical growing up and it is well worth the extra change to get a quality product that will last many years 
very easy to install and worked perfectly my only complaint would be the it could caster turn a bit easier have to twist the wheel to get it to turn 
We used this for the first time at the beach Its so easy to put together and take apart So worth the money Breezy and spacious for us husband myself a toddler and an infant 
We bought this shelter for the beach My wife loves to sit out in the sun but I just cant stand being out there for hours on end I thought having a shelter to get out of the sun would be helpful This was our first trip to use it and I really liked it Its not hard to put up after the first time you do it I love the two zippered openings that allow a breeze to blow through 
Make sure you reinforce the handle if you plan to hang it from anything Otherwise it will rip right through the plastic when filled with water 
Worked great 
Pros this works Its cheap The plastic bag feels wellmade It survived a week at Burning Man Cons The nozzle is pressurefitted into the hose without good enough tolerances and in the process of trying to start the water flow or just carry the bag around the entire nozzle is likely to fall out and have all the water start flowing out at once 
Brand new Still unused but expect it to work like all other top quality Coleman products 
1 
Very handy for dishes and laundry with small spacewater needs It also could easily be filled with ice to be used to cool beverages or small melons I would suggest hosing it off before and after use and drying well before packing 
We have both the Coleman 1person and 2person inflatables and I would recommend the 2person any day even for someone who intended to go solo It just handles much better because it has bigger skegs on the bottom which keep it tracking straighter Other than that drawback weve enjoyed the single one too but its much slower even if youre floating with the current 
This has proved to be a nice item for family recreation I have several of these for group outings The kids just love them The kayaks are quite stable easy to manuever and a novice can easily handle them  Compared with canoes and hardshell kayaks they are more forgiving much easier to transport but quite slow You can plan on traveling about 1 mile per hour without current You will not be able to make much progress up stream or into a stiff wind They have done well on afternoon outings on tame rivers and lakes but definately not built for big water or whitewater The kayaks have proved reasonably durable but I have had to patch several pinholes 
For the money this is a nice beach canopy Some have complained about the material used for the tent pole channels Coleman chose a fishnet type material for some reason Maybe they thought sand would be a problem and that an open weave would let it fall through The pole tips definitely snag the material and rushing could certainly cause it to tear Ive resolved to go slow to prevent damage It packs nice and small and Ill actually be able to get this in my luggage 
Loved this thing Works great 
works but is a bit small 
One side leaks Not going through the hassle of returning it 
Durable convenient great price Whats not to love Its now a mustpack for my camping trips 
Very cheap product  There was a hole between the two sides so water would leak into the clean side 
It served the purpose but the hose gets kinked in packaging so when you use it you have to squeeze the hose back into shape or the kink cuts off the water flow The hose is also too long although I could shorten that Rather a bad rubber smell also 
This was fantastic for a low budget shower The water was hot and sprayed out fast Draw backs turning off and on was hard it was really heavy and you have to stand or kneel directly below it to get get good water flow 
Excelente 
I already had purchased 2 in the past and I just wanted everybody to have their own shower bag so they can enjoy a shower 
it aint much  but works well  follow instructions and you will have hot water  i do believe hot enuff at times to be sanitized  dont drink it  but for good simple shower  it works well 
I was initially concerned about how well the PVC would hold up but Ive had this shoved into the storage area of my Jeep CJ7 with loads of metal for tops and chairs and fishing gear The shower has yet to be punctured or really even discolored Im pleasantly surprised I go to the beach frequently in the summer and I was looking for a way to get the sand off the kids before I get them back in the Jeep This fits the bill and the temperature is better than the showers that are provided 
I bought this for my small camping trailer less expensive than building a simple stand to keep the tongue level Very well made easily attached Unbelievable low price Please note this is only for trailers where you can pick up the tongue it is not a jack that will raise the tongue 
Sturdy little jack stand I use it on my Clackacraft drift boat trailer and it sure makes life easy when positioning my trailer Rolls easily even on rough surfaces and folds up in a snap Sure beats the hand cranks 
Arrived fast and as described 
Works great for my very small trailer easy to install No problems so far getting the wheels to turn Was concerned that it would sag and wobble a lot but the locking mechanism is actually very precise and tight 
I installed this on my cargo trailer When I uncouple the trailer from the vehicle its pretty easy to drop it down and nice to be able to keep the trailer fairly level rather than setting the tongue on the road surface The quality is excellent 
Great Item 
Good for camping Not recommended for permanent home use 
Nice product 
This is the cooler youve been looking for I have a couple of these now for camping I got different colors to distinguish their contents But seriously these keep ice for three days out in the sun and heat And they look awesome I put the magnets of where I camp or fish on them to let everyone know whats up too 
Folds up great and stands up to boiling hot water A plus to have on camping trips 
Full of holes pain in the rear to use on a 2 week camping trip where we counted on this item All the corners leaked the sides leaked everything leaked Contacted Coleman about it when we returned from the trip and they wanted all the original packaging etc for any sort of warranty on their product Strange as they had sent me a bundle of tent poles once no questions asked 
Honestly I thought this item would be bigger It will do the job I think but it does to me look a little too small If there is a large party camping and only one of these might be too time consuming Or buy 2 or 3 maybe 
Perfect Easy to set up Seriously It is easy Buy it 
This is a good product to use for the Glamper out there The water heats up in the sun just as its advertised The only issues I ran into were finding a tree branch tall enough to hang it from in the sun and finding a branch that wouldnt break under the weight five pounds of water I gave it three stars for the nozzle being cheap Unless you have gravity it doesnt really work well hence finding a tree limb 
My shower leaks around the red cap above the word Coleman As we camp in places without water we need to bring it in And so I wanted to bring the shower full but about half the water leaked out in the back of my truck 
The sinks are supposed to be separated yet if you put soap in one side it runs right into the other whats the Point of having TWO separate sinks may as well just remove the middle separator and use it as one sink stupid piss poor design 
Great value 
worked well easy to set up but it got pretty hot inside An umbrella would be better but you cant fit that in your carryon 
This little tent works really well on the beach We took a 5 month old and it protected the baby from the sand wind and sun Packs up really well too 
Everything you hear about the latch in the other reviews is true I dont know what Coleman was thinking by replacing that old school latch this one is flimsy an pathetic Terribly disappointed If you can find an antique steel Coleman try and figure out how to switch latches with the new one shame on you Coleman 
Classic design that should last forever 
What a classic This model cooler reminds me of the one I grew up with through the 50s and 60s I especially appreciate the locking lid and the dependable quality Ive come to expect of Coleman products 
DOnt buy it The hose is cheap the thing leaks if it is any way but hanging The directions say to let it lay with the black sideshown to the sun for heat but it leaks when laying that way Save your money or go without a shower 
We lay this on the tailgate of the truck when camping and use it as a hand washing station The valve is easy enough for the kids to manipulate and they think it is fun 
Used this shower when I was abround and there was no hot water just plenty of free sunlight Works well and would recommend to others 
It was ok as far as the capacity of 5 gallons of water but the cap the hose and the shower head are pretty flimsy It works ok but I dont see it among my other camping gear that would last long 
Great product 
Being able to handwash delicate items while campingonwheels is priceless 
This was absolutely perfect for our camping trip It worked perfect and rinsed out well to store until next time Lifesaver for sure 
bought this for my webelos den to use during their campouts  purchased two of these to be able to use 3 compartments for the standard wash stations and the 4th for items waiting to be dried and put away they work great and stow away nicely another great camping product from Coleman 
The first time we used this wash basin it worked wonderfully the next morning after breakfast however it sprung a leak right on the seal on the bottom where the Grey support rods are We had to wash dishes in a bucket and a pan for the rest of our camping trip I did contact amazon when we returned home and they are sending another to replace this faulty one Will do an updated review with the next one we recieve 
Thank you 
I like the product It gets the job done It did take some time for me to figure out how to fold it after use 


Love this thing I lost one and immediately bought another If you spend a lot of time at the beach this is ideal Comes with sandbags to weigh down the corners Can zip up all sides and would fit a couple nicely for an evening under the stars Not a tent but a very versatile beach shade 
This is extremely easy to set up I had a crawling baby while I was setting up and I was still able to manage We have not used outside yet as I plan to use at the beach and well its just not warm enough yet It is bigger than I thought which is great will be able to get the whole family under it Great purchase so far 
This is cheap and heavy but it does work Its best used for car camping I wouldnt recommend taking it in the backcountry with you as it weighs around 15oz I really just wanted it for the showerhead I cut it off after testing it out and attached it to a cuben fiber bag I made which weighed less then 20g This made a much more reasonable shower to carry with me on the trail The construction and build of this seems sturdy has a good fill hole and cap a plastic round handle at the top to carry and hang it from The hose is thin walled but a decent ID so it flows well The shower head can be twisted to stopstart the flow of water From what Ive seen this is on par with every other sub 10 solar shower out there so dont expect too much out of it It definitely serves its purpose and the 5 gallons is enough for two showers if you dont have long hair 
The seal where water is added is flimsy and opens at the slightest movement On the other end the red nozzle fell out of the hose repeatedly Also to get the water started is nearly impossible with wet soapy hands Forget about washing your hair easily unless you are 7 feet tall or take a ladder along to hang it high enough 
I wonder how long it will hold up without developing a crack or leak When full I imagine the seams are stressed 
This is a pretty good camp shower if you use good common sense when filling these up  putting them in the sun to warm Once filled to the 5 gallon capacityDO NOT pick this shower or any other camp shower up by the handle because they will break A little common sense goes a long way with these type of showers These are very handy to have while campingespecially paired with a privacy shelter that can double as a toilet if you add a camping toilet to your gear 
Weve taken it camping several times and it works great Heres what you have to do to maximize its use and life First we through a rope with a log on it over a tree limb and tied it to the shower bag Then lower the rope so that you can fill the bag After pull the rope so it goes back up to your desired height Place a stake in the ground to hold the shower rope and maintain the height We take five individual one gallon jugs and fill up the shower bag two gallons at a time No need to have five gallons for one shower If your setup is done correctly it will be easy to refill before each shower You can leave the jugs in the sun for the same effect 
Great cooler wellbuilt 
The photos and description are not clear There is a silver painted model and a true stainless steel model Be certain you are buying the correct one 
I replaced my stopper on the Tahoe Q7I with this one the OEM stopper kept leaving marring on the bow This does not and is equally soft 
One chamber leaks Will use it for rinsing and drying Washing will be performed in a more reliable option 
Very very small its a joke 
Used for a camping trip in 2014 and it was certainly helpful throughout for clearing up dirty dishes and the griddle after breakfast Didnt puncture and even stays insulated given the water supply was only cold water with no hot water supplied by the park Put my hand to the outside and could feel it stay warm on the outside even though the water inside of the dual basins was frigidly cold The plastic tubes help maintain stability and cleaning out afterwards is a breeze 
I cant believe this thing costs as much as it does I had a buddy literally give it to me because he hated it and he knew Id love it because I have an Airstream and love everything Aluminum In my opinion its ok at best As numerous other reviewers mention the latch is poor and doesnt work as intended I also had the top separate at the hinge and had to epoxy it back together I havent had any problems with the drain plug as others have mentioned but I also dont feel like this cooler keeps ice any better than my 50qt Coleman marine cooler or even the Rubbermaid 70qt on wheels we have Ive seen some say its as good as Yeti and thats laughable I used it this past weekend and had to drain and refill the ice every day 
I brought this to MOAB where the dirt blows into every pore of you body A bath at the end of the day is the perfect thing to crawl into your sleeping bag clean I found out fine dust can stop the spout from operating as well as it pulled off and detached from the hose The other thing that seems troubling is to clean it properly and put it away dry inside without mold growing Coleman should take a lesson from Camelback in having a wide mouth not only to fill it but to clean and dry it properly Very disappointed 
Water gets warm enoughmounting full bag high enough for the shower attachment takes a bit of engineeringmuscle with a full bag Off the grid cabin do not have water except spring fed stream or drinking water we bring in so fill this in a clear stream and then hang on a large tree in the sun So far holding up OK 
very pleased 
I really like this little sink It makes doing dishes in camp so much easier Have only used it a couple times but it is holding up well so far Ive had both ice cold and almost boiling water in it It is on the small side but there are just two of us using it so not a lot of dishes to wash in camp After using we locate a handy tree limb hang it by one of the handles and let it drip dry Couldnt get it back into its original package very easy and did not want to risk it tearing so now we are storing it in a plastic bin with other camping gear It does fold up easily though and as long as it continues to hold up as well as it has I will be a happy camper 
We used this camping and it works really well Just be sure to let it dry out fully before storing it long term I would buy it again if needed 
Save yourself the money and get actual tubs these are hard to refold and kind of small 
Great beach tent I had plans of trying to put this thing together before actually getting to the beachbut that didnt happen Luckily my mother and I were able to put it together fairly easily It was perfect to keep us and the kids out of the sun Recommended Update We had a pole break recently I called Coleman as we hadnt used the Shelter that many times before the pole broke and they sent me a free replacement I was surprised and delighted by the good customer service received at such a large company 
This is a perfect beach tent and easy to put up 
dog loves this thing 
Great cooler kept all my drinks cold and my food fresh over a 3 day camping weekend Used 3 10lb bags of ice and worked perfectly 
BUT it looks like the photo and i am sure it will heat my water up wonderfully haha cant wait to go camping in a few weeks 
It arrived quickly and I found it to be very sturdy I have another portable showerbathroom tent set up that uses a five gallon bucket and a bag That takes more time to set up This one is much easier and takes up less space 
perfect camping item 
sturdy a little difficult to fold back but good thick plastic and works fine 
Its a lot smaller than it looks Too small for me Had to send it back immediately 
We needed a umbrellatent for the beach We were planning on going to Maui so we needed one that would be able fit in our checked bags I was hesitant to buy this one only because it seemed like it would be a hassle to set up at the beach The umbrella one that they sell on amazon seemed much easier and the reviews seemed promising but the dimensions of the umbrella were way too big for us to take on the airplane Im glad I purchased this Coleman Compact Shade It is definitely compact enough that is was able to fit in our check in bag We tried setting it up at home first so that we knew how to do it took maybe 10 minutes to figure it out Its a very big tent and will be able to fit our whole family comfortably Unfortunately our trip to Maui was cancelled at the last minute due to my daughter getting an earache so we didnt get to test it out at the beach but we kept this anyways so that we can use it in the future Good quality great price 
I initially liked this tent very much for its wonderful design It is lightweight and very easy to assemble and disassemble But the quality of stitching zippers etc in my unit was really low 
Large cleat to use with 11 mm static line not climbing 
I was a little hesitant at first thinking they would be cheaply made I was pleasantly surprised when they arrived They are very well made and serve their intended purpose perfectly I have no complaints 
This seems to be well made cant beat the price It was surprisingly large coming out of the boxfrom tip to tip its about 11 inches 
This is an 8 inch cleat not 10 so I was a little surprised when it arrived and was not as big as I expected it to be even though the tag on it indicated 10 inches Someone may want to check their rulers on this one 
Bought this big nylon cleat to tie off a bunch of excess rope on our dock Its big and solid A good value for the money Id definitely buy another 
Love the cooler  bought for the same price as a regular Coleman steel belted You can trust Coleman quality 
I have been wanting one of these coolers for years Reminds me of the quality built ice chests that my parents used when we used to go camping in the 60s This chest did not disappoint The only thing that could make it better is a bottle opener attached to the side like my Dads used to have 
Very useful and folds up very compactly A clever design Its the kind of plastic that you certainly shouldnt pour boiling water into 
Whenever we went camping it was a pain trying to clean all of our pots and dishes so when I saw this I knew that we had to have it Its constructed well and the plastic didnt feel flimsy The dual basin sizes were prefect for soaking and then cleaning the pots  dishes I wouldnt advise using boiling water in it but it does well with hotwarm water I love that it folds up and packs away quickly and easily but I wish that It had included a storage case with it 
doesnt last long before it started to leak great idea poor design 
flimsy but does the trick for washing dishes as opposed to bring a tote to do them 
My wife laughed at me when she saw this arrive with the UPS man Well I guess Ill be laughing at her when the apocalypse happens and no one has running water to bathe with except for me 
From the packing Warning This product contains chemicals known to the state of California to cause cancer and birth defects and other reproductive harm This container is not be used for drinking water before using rinse the container with one table spoon of baking soda The bag has a bad plastic smell I can imagine what happens if it bakes in the sun for a while I am sure the water makes very soft skin 
I love camping but hate going to sleep without a shower This is the answer to that Its so easy to use too all you do is fill it with water from a faucet river pond or lake then lay it on the gound in the sun Let it bake in the sun for a few hrs I fill it before lunch that way by dinner time its ready See it heats the water from the sunlight want hotter water leave it in the sun longer Then just hang it in a tree or what ever you got Open the valve when you are ready to get wet It has a built in shower head and lasts about 812 min depending on how much you open the valve Its fantastic Good for camping traveling power outages anytime you arent near a working shower 
Rooming Great for the beach 
A bit flimsy and we ended up with holestear in the seam after its 2nd use 
Will use it soon 
great for camping 
Great piece of gear to have when your camping fishing or hunting Coleman makes quality products 
Nice cooler looks good but the lid does not lockdown very tight 
Purchased this for camping to keep the firewood dry Great item 
We bought this to protect our grandbaby from the strong sun and harsh winds encountered at the beach and pool Easy set up and take down a real plus Better quality material and construction assured us this is not a one season shade ours is still in like new condition after a very busy season and is ready for the next 
a poles elastic broke after a few uses we can still use it fine but it takes a bit more work not much to set it up 
very good service thanks them for the quality of oroductos selling hope they continue to improve and wish good luck thanks for everything 
Well all I can say is I love these things I have had several and depending on where your are camping these things are great I have used them for good hot showers to clean up for years and I have nothing bad to say about it 
We had one a long time ago for tent camping and loved it You can fill it with warm water or let the black plastic absorb sunlight to heat up the shower water Good to have one on hand for emergencies 
It is a good product but much thinner than the other one I have It already has a hole in it from only one camping trip If you get one be careful to keep it away from anything sharp Otherwise it is very handy at the campsite 
Easy to setup and put away Work well with hot water 
worked great for 4 uses then developed leaks at the corners Had hoped to use it more then 4 times 
Smaller than I wanted but it worked for putting the clean dishes in after washing them in a bigger bucket 
Convenient and compact Bring the kitchen sink LOL 
its too hard to use its not for me and its too flimsy too hard to use 
Works well at the beach in Hawaii 
This tent is really nice We have used it at the river a few times and it works nicely I would recommend having an extra hand to put it up to make life a bit easier But its very compact and functions very well When you need that bit of privacy or a place to put a kid down for a nap this cant be beat The shade also has some great built in features like the clothes hanger and pockets both of which you will use and the zippered window shade great for families in the sun 
Perfect fit the kids 
product received in good time and we liked it because it was requested by me to give away and use 
Camping or emergency this is an awesome device to keep around for any situation We used it during the 1994 earthquake We had no power or gas for a few days but we showered with one of these camping showers 
I have not used this product yet but I am concerned the plastic will melt if the water is too hot 
Coleman is the best brand cooler ever made Ive had one for over 20 years and use it exclusively when traveling simply because ice lasts for up to 4 days or more even in the heat of summer I purchased this one as a wedding gift because they love to go camping and this is by far the best cooler on the market today 
Not what I hoped One side leaks into the other So can only wash the dishes 

We purchased two of these after we had a massive tornado hit town last year We didnt have power for over a week It was late April and not quite warm enough to really warm the water without the help of the sun We have a lot of shade around here but we managed to move the packs to keep them in the sun The directions were not easy to understand and we had a really hard time figuring out how the nozzle worked They still leaked some when we put them in the sun but no rips in the seams and it really did make life a little better while we were without hot water HOWEVER the SMELL of the item infuses the water You get that plasticPVC smell and therefore it will transfer onto the skin But it is better than smelling like BO I would recommend this for situations like what we were in but I dont know if I would trust it on the campground Like I said it leaked out of the nozzle and wasted water 
I bought this camp shower and didnt even use it On the box you are notified there are chemicals known to cause cancer in the shower I promptly returned it 
I love it   I layer ice  rock salt  then more ice on my beverages They nearly freeze in the bottle and stay that way for three days or so 
I wouldnt waste your time or money on this product Yes it folds up easily but its sort of a hassle to carry with water and was impossible for me to carry by myself We ended up using it more as a drying rack for dishes than a wash basin 
It is ok kind of a pain to use while camping 
Love this 
Piece of junk that is made in China We used it 3 times and the seam broke in the middle of the two basins I just threw it away after that Good idea but very flimsy and cheaply made Get onetwo hard sided basins instead 
A little cheesy but works 
It is hard to keep up if its windy I bought better stakes and it still blew down twice Fabric is nice 
Great buy but rather large It doesnt take too long to set up If you dont want anyone at the beach giving you dirty looks get there and set up early Bring extra large zip lock bags and add sand to them to weight down the tent although we didnt have any problems without them 
This is great for the beach Easy to set up  lightweight Ideally its only good for 2 but it works for us As a big guy I cant change in there but it has come in handy for our son and the wife Would definitely recommend it We used it all summer and the stakes and sandbags came in handy on windy days at the beach Enjoy 
Highly recommend this beach tent No complaints here If you have a clue you should get this tent 
Works great folds up nicely 
Any time you can get the Steel Belted on sale do it Ive been through a number of the all plastic versions and they just dont hold up to normal abuse I have two steel belted coolers and both have taken far greater abuse and continue to get the job done I also find that the steel belted versions keep ice longer 
very happy with this coolerbought for my sons Christmas several years ago and he loves it 
I used to have this shower then tried another What I really like about this shower is the ease of turning it on by pulling or pushing back in the shower head You can do it with one hand so if you need to soap up etc you arent wasting water I also enjoy using the warm water to rinse dishes brush my teeth 
1 Corner Store Plastic bags filled with sand do the trick Paracord them to the structure Additional spare sandbags check Tent stakes are not much use when you have sand and byobbags and some cord 2 if you REALLY want to stake something down use rebar Prebend it at home into a horse shoe shape and pound it in Makes for a solid anchor 
Absolutely the worst item Ive purchased on Amazon We tried putting this thing together and finally gave up when we realized it wouldnt stay together if ANY sand gets in the magnetic ends This thing is way to complicated to put together Weve had other shades that were simple and functional this one isnt We returned it 
I have used this two years now for my camping beach trips and its been a great little cabana Its not my favorite but its getting 5 stars because is holds up well to extreme winds and a few storms that we left it set up on the beach for while we ran for shelter in the car Its small and portable and can be put up by one person with a bit of difficulty and not in high winds It is not at all hard with two even in the high wind if you take the time to fill the included sand bags with sand insert them in the in interior pockets to help weight it down so you dont have a kite on your hands My only regret is that it only accomodates ground sitting or low beach chairs which are hard for me to get out of I prefer my umbrella but when the wind is high I use this for shade AND its a wonderful wind block when you close up the back window This way I can make sandwiches and we arent eating sand in every bite All in all I am most pleased with this purchase There are ones out there that pop up and are taller but not as stable as this one is in the ever present wind that seems to come everytime I am on the beach As I mentioned I left it during a storm once we threw the cooler and chairs inside and closed up both flaps the front you see pictured actually can zip up as well or its a sitting spot and although its not meant to be waterproof it kept the stuff reasonably dry and the stuff helped keep it from blowing away  I would also suggest stronger stakes if you are in high winds the small ones dont really do much but with the sand and my gear its managed to hold ok without them I use this along with my umbrella and I can spend all day on the beach and not burn Hope this helps 
its just ok 
to flimpsy I feel like it would break with the weight of the water 
What a great cooler 
Quality Durable Kept my food cold over a five day camping trip in California with heat I was impressed how well the ice block ice held up considering the higher temperatures 90s I look forward to more use 
That is what this cooler is like because when you walk into a room or campsite and this cooler is there you just have to look at it Its sooooo darned sexy  OK so we have had ours about seven years or so We bought it when we were still tent camping and now we use it with our popup camper We could not be much happier with any cooler You need to make one improvement as soon as you buy this but its so inexpensive I still have to give this 5 stars Id give it 6 if I could Go to your nearest big box home improvement store and buy a small roll of white adhesive backed 14 X 14 foam gasket by Frost King or similar manufacturer Clean the groove in the lid with a solvent like Mineral spirits or similar Peel the backing off the gasket and stick the gasket into the groove in the lid working your way around to the back where you started Cut the gasket so its essentially one continuous seal leaving as small of a gap between start and finish as possible Now when you close the lid you will have a virtually air tight seal We go camping a week or sometimes eight days at a time Before we leave I go to the grocery store and buy 2 five lb pieces of block ice to put in the bottom If you have the freezer space you could make some block ice at home and save the 4 or 5 bucks After placing the block ice one either side of the bottom of the cooler I add our weeks worth of food bacon dogs burgers bacon milk butter bacon steak bacon you name it  Then on top of the food I add regular ice which I make at home though sometimes we buy it bagged at the store This cooler keeps ice 8 days or more this way no kidding  Im so completely impressed I have left the cooler closed after returning home and had some of the block ice still in it over 9 days Yes I also grew up camping with a 1960s original steel belted Coleman cooler and yes Ill admit the quality of the vintage coolers was better Thicker steel better latch screw on Oringed drain cap and built in bottle opener Believe me I will get that ole Coleman from my big brother one day  It will be mine oh yes it will be mine  But the reality is the new steel belted coolers are what we can go out and buy today and this one is great Get it in stainless steel and it will be guaranteed never to shrink stink wrinkle or rust  
I bought this because our hot water heater is out and will be for a few days while we wait for a part to come in The pop off cap where you put the water in is hard to get off but pops off if the bag is too full The spout leaks There is zero water pressure so there is no shower Its just a trickle Its so heavy that you have to hang it on something really high and sturdy to get it high enough to rain down on you or you have to be on your knees I ended up washing up with hot water from the stove because this wasnt even worth trying to use Im going back to the store to see if there is a camp shower with a twist off cap and maybe a 3 gallon capacity I do not recommend this at all 
Very bad product Heshe has 2 problems heshe becomes unstuck with easiness in the sides For the abovementioned my van you floods in the back part Additionally when the weighing one with a rope to travers of a tree the support of which is sustained was unstitched and I allow to leave the white tube of support that originally place setting comes It is an I waste of money 
If you camp in a dusty area or hike and get grubby its nice to clean up at night Im past the age that a dip in an ice cold stream is even entertained With this unit the water warms up fine during a sunny day The on off is practical and easy to use It is a camping classic for a reason and worth the money They can get holes if you are careless and set them on something sharp Small punctures are easy to repair with tape 
I think this Coleman shower is well made very sturdy I hung it up but not quite high enough and it did great When I set it in the sun the water gets quite warm I am thinking of ordering another one price is not bad We are building a house so right now this works for us 
Its cheap and i probably could build something better  but honestly it worked well when camping out at a livestock event 
I have been using this consistently for my last 5 camping trips and it is incredibly handy We camp at state parks so you are not allowed to do your dishes at the faucet and the sinks to do your dishes in the bathroom are usually far away for there is a line Despite the fact that we have a camper we dont like to do our dishes in the sink in there because we dont want food bits getting stuck in the drain or any grease in the drain making the camper stink so we purchased this sink My only complaint is that when you put the water in if youre not careful it will slosh around and you might get soap in your plain water side especially if you have to carry it a distance We are lucky because we have a sink on the outside of our camper so we dont have to carry it too far It has held up quite well even when I forgot there was a sharp knife in it to be washed it did not puncture it at all Highly recommend this product for my fellow camping enthusiasts 
Looks are very deceiving item is small but worked well 
One of the legs had issues staying in collapsing made it awkward The raccoon however used it to wash his stolen chips marshmallows and cereal He loved it 
Great quality  kept the kids shaded on the beach If youre not used to setting up tents its a bit confusing at first but doable and after that it should be no problem 
This was a gift for my boyfriend So far he is more than happy with the cooler 
Amazing durability solid looks and good performance Slightly pricy for a cooler but these will last a really long time Friggin bomb proof 
We have two of these and use them often I fill it up lay it on the picnic table and when we get back from a day of hiking and getting dirty we all have nice hot showers waiting the only problem is that the hose gets a kink in it and the valve is a bit cheesy but to have a nice hot shower in the middle of nowhere is worth fighting the valve 
It was split at the seem and I was not able to use it even once Low quality Seemed like it would be good 
We used this tent on our recent trip to Maine great for the beach easy to set up and great protection from the sun Great product 
Used it this summer at the beach Perfect shelter against the sun and the sand bags keep it grounded even when it gets windy Easy to setup once you get the hang of it Could hear people commenting how they should get one of these 
I absolutely love this folding wash basin The only thing I didnt think about when purchasing is that it is a plastic material so be cautious about placing sharp objects into and taking out of the basin I love that it folds up into a small space easy for packing and carrying This is a great option for someone looking for something that takes up less space than hard plastic bins 
My wife and I used this for our camping trips and it is perfect Holds the plates and it rinses out perfectly with no extra great or food residue Folds up easily and opens nice and wide with very durable plastic sides and seams 
This was shipped fast and is just perfect for camping folds down for storage so takes up very little room also the seller shipped this item fast 
The two compartments were not actually separate The soapydirty water from one side flooded into the other side Not sure if there was a leak or they were designed this way Very disappointing We requested a refund 
Little smaller than I expected hard to soak the hot dog and marshmallow pokers as they are to long but it is nice and compact made well sturdy thick plastic tubs 
Great product 
Great look and durability 
Well worth the price I beat the bageebers out of at least two cheaper plastic coolers on my drift boat and finally stepped up to this steel box that easily supports the forward passenger seat It should hold up more than twice as long as the two combined It is sturdy durable land does the job for me 
Bought this thinking it would be a substantial cooler Light weight and not impressed overall Wish I could return it but Ive used it Lock doesnt stay secure Not worth 100 
Very nice cooler 
keeps items cold up to 4 days inside conditions havent tried it in the heat looks great and drains well with side plug only down fall is the locking latch only hold 10 lbs pressure but i think its less than that 
This is pretty much a novelty It does not hold ice and it leaks around the drain Wouldnt buy another even if it was half price 
Terrific product lives up to the Coleman name 
It may not be necessary to spend this much money for a cooler yet there is a beauty in having this one in your back seat doing a great job with a lock to keep the lid on 
One side leaked very first use 
I gave two starts because one side had acquired a hole prior to my first use and has a second hole after the first use One side works well to hold water for washing but Im disappointed that I cant idealize the other side for rinse I knew this would be a risk after reading the other reviews but I didnt expect it prior to the first time I used it 
Upon very first use washing dishes The middle section piece ripped out along one side at the seam making the sink now just one big section Had to hot glue  not sure if it will still work though Was hoping this would last years didnt even get to the faucet 
Love the tent itself which Ill review further below but first a warning to others planning to use it on beaches Please check with the beach rules and if they allow tents We found out the hard way that at least as of August 2014 MYRTLE BEACH SC no longer allows tents or tent type things apparently even the SportsBrella from being used on their beaches In other words they only allow umbrellas About the tent Very easy to set up if you have another person to help I found by reading the reviews how you need to prepare in advance so my husband and I unpacked and tried to set it up indoors before the beach trip Once we got the hang of the order in which to do things it took about 15 minutes for us to set it up on the beach our happiness at the success was extremely short lived and we then had to take down immediately much to our disappointment The sand bags do help in weighing it down on a windy day we initially found it tough to get the stakes in but later moved a few paces forward to a damper part of the beach and were able to fix them well 
After one practice run of putting it together it was easy to put together It worked great on the beach 
The lock does not work but even with that major flaw it still keeps ice all weekend in 100 degree temps Gotta keep it in the shade though 
Good Product 
As expected Was well packed and worked to my expectations I would purchase again Very handy 
Good 
OK seems heavy duty but attracts oil 
This thing is as tough as nails It makes camp cleanup about as easy as it can be Pour boiling water over your dishes then add cold to wash em then rinse It folds down by compressing the plastic and it seems to take it without problem 
Great purr fict 
ripped very easily not quick set up worth the price 
Smaller than I was planning for cant wash a pan very well in that but seems put together well 
leaked 
works well 
This was a gift for my hubbie I had to hide it for a month It was SO hard but so worth it to see the SMILE on his face He says he is gonna keep it till he dies 
works great 
great product 
very sad We were camping for the weekend  I used it ONE TIME for a couple dishes and forks and a cup and the middle RIPPED and the two water parts combine  done broke 
great 
Cheap quality small size We use it but 
Well I missed the one month window for return without knowing and now Im stuck with this defective basin We went camping for Easter and upon first use I noticed that the corners were leaking The water drained out of the corners and we had to was the dishes quickly Its not very sturdy and my 12 pans did not fit all the way I mostly used it to hold the soapy water while I held my dishes and lathered them up I would have been better off buying a plastic tub for the dishes 
Recently had a week on Cape Cod with this shade tent four days on the beach all of them sunny and warm one day very windy Build quality is solid and I expect to have many seasons use out of this tent It is roomy for two adults The large rear window has an insect screen and can be opened for air circulation When fully closed there is enough room for one adult to get changed The windy day exposed a couple of flaws First if its windy youll need better pegs The six pegs provided would be adequate for firm soil but not sand Second Im not sure why but the two guy ropes would not stay tightened even when there was no wind The nylon friction devices slipped far too easily on the cord Ive never had this problem before on any other tent and may need to buy replacements This shade tent was difficult to put up singlehanded I am an experienced camper and over the years have owned a number of tents with the shockcorded pole design All of the others including my current threeperson made by Coleman I couldcan erect unassisted in a few minutes I think the biggest issue with this tent is that the sleeves for the poles are mesh rather than solid material This makes sliding the poles in and out a real hassle the pole joints continuously snag on the mesh so you need an extra pair of hands to help guide them through Overall Im happy with my purchase because once the tent is up it does its job very well and I have no doubts about its quality and longevity 
We used it over labor day weekend Held up to the wind with the sandbags and our stuff inside My only gripe is that one of the metal hole protectors already came off And the fiber for the top rod holder was frayed The instructions were clear and everything was as described It is a bit hard for 1 person to set this up but if youre a pro at tent setting then its probably doable I just hope this stands up well for our summer beach trips for a long time I like the compactness and how lightweight it is This is a popular beach shade and the green is quite common as well We saw 4 other tents like ours in a small beach in 1 day You can probably put some ribbons or identifying marks to make sure you get to the right one  
great cooler 
Great Product It is the official Dad cooler just like the one my father had during my childhood but dont buy it just for the nastalgia this cooler works great Once you prime it your drinks and food will remain cold for days with the same bags of ice During a 7day trip I filled the cooler initially with 3 x 10lb bags will hold 4 bags and only had to slightly draintop off with ice twice every 3 days The basecore ice never completely melted which ensured all items maintained a constantstable temperature 
Ability to maintain block ice is good Ability to maintain cubed ice is fair Retro look is perfect 
It is as advertised but bulkier than expected Easy to set up but you have to schlep with everything else you have to beach set it up and it fits 2 to 3 people It worked well to keep sun off of you as well If you do not mind the schlep part of it then it is well worth it Hard to get back into bag at end of day 
Works like a charm 
I was really excited about the compactness and weight of this item It came right before my trip so I didnt have a chance to test it out before we left Thank goodness I always bring bowls big enough to do the dishes in Like MANY of the previous reviewers this came with a hole in one basin I used it three times before giving up on it The leak just kept getting bigger Amazon was very good about providing for a return I love the handles and how it folds but I cannot recommend this product 
Nice to have and takes little space 
It is alright it is basicly a throwaway after you use it for a several day trip 
These are required for nearly all the areas I hike now and are a necessary evil Got tired of renting them from the parks dept so decided to drop the money on my own This thing is huge and not a clean cylindrical shape I assume to make it hard for our nonopposable thumb friends to handle which makes it a pain to carry unless you opt for the optional bag I have an 80L pack and it fits inside but leaves little room for much else besides sleeping bag and clothes I can however get all food for 4 days2 people my optimus nova stove GSI dualist cookset snacks and first aid kit in it The yellow is VERY bright and you will not lose this in the woods It has a reflective tape strip around the middle and I added some more for ease in finding in the dark but it is so yellow it nearly glows Seriously if you get lost this thing will make a good signal Hopefully the bears are colorblind The lid is very easy for human operation but it is not sealed and water can get in if you set it lid up Does make a good camp stool too Oh and the thing is toughmy son booted it off a 25ft cliff because he wanted to see what would happen I was not happy at that moment watching a 70 plastic bucket at the mercy of gravity but it came out with nary a scratch Summary Pros  Large brightly colored for ease in locating lid easy to operate tough large opening for easy packing Cons  Large brightly colored required in most areas anymore 
This is our second bear cannister since we needed more room for our food We have the clear Bear Valult BV500 which is nice but the lid is difficult to remove The Bear Keg is slightly larger than the Bear Vault and is MUCH easier to get into    for humans 
Really like it Simple to put up and great seating at the park Would recommend 
Provides great coverage from sun protection on the beach Good UPF 50 Sun protection Rear window provides more air flow when it gets a bit hot inside Full zip up to turn into a privacy changing area on the beach when the line gets long Light weight easy to carry with carrying case and handles Setting up 0 mph wind easy job one person 8 mph wind at the beach two person job the 3 poles that go through the net for create stability is horrible I was able to accidentally mange poke a hole in the net The netting cause the poles to get stuck while putting on or taking off becuase the poles take apart and it would get caught every now and then 
On time as described 
Leaked the first time is used it Stains like crazy Thru it away after first few days of use 
Wish the basins were a little deeper and the material was a little sturdier Easy to pack away and move but somewhat difficult to use It is nice to have when you are camping though so you dont have to find a place to wash your dishes I would buy it again but hope they will make some future modifications to make this better 
Perfect for washing dishes while camping I love the two separate water areas I also really like that it is collapsible 
I just bought this bear canister but full disclosure not on Amazon I caught a really good sale elsewhere Memorial day weekend But on to the review I was a backpacker in high school and college and a little beyond But Ive been away from it for a couple of decades Bear canisters didnt exist way back when so Id never used one And I never had a problem with bears in the the White Mountains of NH where I used to hike But I did have plenty of problems with mice around shelters and chipmunks and squirrels and raccoons Annoying little buggers We also have coyotes fox bobcats  lynx the very rare reported cougar sighting and brainless golden retrievers on the trail By far I worry more about rodents than bears So when I got into backpacking again I did a lot of reading to catch up on equipment and clothing trends One thing I found is that many areas and national parks around the country are now requiring some form of bear resistant protection for your food Hmmm never even crossed my mind Apparently black bear populations are doing really well here in the Northeast and human  bear interactions have increased to the point where its not all that unusual to get a visit from a lazy thief looking for snacks So I looked around at bear canisters and quickly narrowed my choices down to two options the Bear Keg and the Bear Vault BV500 I finally chose the Bear Keg Why 1 Size Both are large The Bear Vault is 700 cu in or 1147 liters The Bear keg is just slightly larger at 716 cu in or 1173 liters But call the size a tie Both can handle food for two people for 45 days 2 Access Both have an opening of almost exactly 7 which is fine for getting stuff in or out Again no significant difference 3 Weight Here we get into the biggest difference between the two options The Bear Vault is made from polycarbonate and weighs 25 lbs The Bear Keg is made from some other polymer but they dont state exactly what and it weighs in at a whopping 35 lbs empty So the Bear Vault wins on weight which is a biggie 4 Locks Heres the second big difference The Bear Vault uses a screw on lid with plastic tabs that need to be depressed in order to rotate the lid But people report that depressing those tabs requires a leaning curve And they say that when the plastic is cold it doesnt flex very well Also cold fingers are apparently hard pressed to operate the tabs But most importantly bears in the Adirondacks of NY about two hours from my home have apparently figured out how to use the tabs just fine The Bear Vault has proven to be defeatable by real black bears The Bear Keg on the other hand uses three rotating latches that require some sort of tool to open A coin a key a knife something with a thin straight edge The locks are simple easy to use in any weather and reliable But best of all bears havent figured out how to defeat them as long as you close up the keg properly 5 Color No Im not gonna get into a discussion of trail fashion here The Bear Vault uses clear polycarbonate which provides a really nice side benefityou can see whats in the canister and where it is in the canister This cuts down on digging dumping and repacking But a clear canister can be a lot more difficult to find in the woods What if a bear plays with it for 15 minutes and moves it 100 feet from its original location Clear or black canisters are a lot tougher to see when you dont know where to look The Bear Keg on the other hand uses an opaque day glow yellow polymer that stands out like a sore thumb against a green brown and grey background in the woods It also had a band of reflective material around the middle in case youre searching for it with a headlamp at night The convenience of a clear container does me no good if I cant find the container Also these bear canisters are not so huge that its very difficult to find stuff in them And it gets easier every day as you consume the food in them 6 Price Both the Bear Vault and the Bear Keg have the same list price and both can be found discounted to near the same price online So price is not a discriminating factor 7 Attaching To A Pack The Bear Vault has dimples and ridges molded in for grip These allow it to be cinched to a pack with paracord or a velcro strap The Bear Keg is smooth and slippery all the way around with an oval shape thats fatter at the center than the ends That makes it tougher for a bear to manipulate but it also means its tougher to attach to a pack For that reason They sell a nylon carrying case for the Bear Keg but that increases the cost and drives up the weight even more Not a problem for me my pack is a 110 liter Kelty Red Cloud I carry everything inside my pack Its easier than lashing stuff to the outside If you intend to lash a canister outside your pack the carry case is a must have But DO NOT place the canister at night with the case on The nylon bag provides a bear with a convenient carry handle to cart off your bear keg thereby defeating the whole idea of protecting your food supply So in the end what made me buy the Bear Keg over a lighter alternative were better security easy to use locks and the high visibility color I couldnt find any place in the lower 48 where the Bear Keg is not certified for use On the other hand the Adirondacks near my home wont allow the Bear Vault because bears have learned how to defeat the locks on it I docked the product one star for weight This is one of the heaviest options on the market Id love to see them get the weight down a pound or so without compromising volume or security But maybe thats a tough wish to fulfill PS  Either of these canisters makes a serviceable camp stool for eating lacing up your boots washing dishes or washing clothes Happy trails and be safe out there 
This canister is extremely well made and durable It is also VERY heavy Youll definitely need the carrying case for it or some method to attach it to your pack In retrospect there are other products which will do the same thing and weigh much less 
This is one of the larger canisters out there  and unfortunately one of the heaviest Ive had it for a few years and while its no fun to carry it works Its not waterproof though which means its probably not scentproof either Ive never had it attacked by a bear so I cant speak to its effectiveness I did buy the carrying case which makes it possible to strap it to the bottom of your pack rather than inside if necessary Be sure to remove it from the carrying case when you place it at night or it just gives the bear something to carry it away with 
I like the large size of this Bear Keg The Bear Keg appears to be heavy duty and works great 
Large heavy and even so I am glad I bought it I will never have to worry as there is no way a bear will be able to open or destroy it 
Very large enough for about 3 people for about 23 nights of backpacking I thought it was going to have rubber or some type of smell proof sealing but it is plastic on plastic No doubts it will hold up to a bear but i dont want the bear to know its there in the first place 
Get this if you go into the bear woods It is required in a few of the national parks and more and more national forests in bear country It may not fit a weeks worth of food but it will hold a few days and it legit for being bear proof Nice design and it looks like a tank could run it over with no ill effects 
Pros Have you seen the videos This thing is almost unbreakable Protected my food well from all beasts and bugs and dirt since I dropped it quite a few times Cons Its pretty darn heavy OK for a few day trip but once you start going on some longer adventures you might want to get one of the lighter options 
Awesome for the beach Easy to setup and break down Quality built 
Its a food canister Nothing much to say about it 
Perfect For those concerned about waterproofing you can make your own gasket if you know what you are doing 
Well made but limited room Used to having a bag that I throw over a tree limb so going to a hard container is more limiting 
Love the fact that it was tested at the Grizzly  Wolf Discovery Center in West Yellowstone  passed the test The 3 scrws that hold the lid on are large enough to use a coin OR a screwdriver or something else if needed Just hope my trip into Alaska this summer I wont have to prove that it IS bear proof Will make my camping trip less dangerous too 
This is a great product No more fears of loosing food to bears No assaults yet but expect it to hold up nicely 
Works great 
Thank you 
Very good product and price shipping was on time and free is the only way to go 
works well when you are camping then stores well 
Worked great until the sink gave away at the cornersonly used a few times 
I took this on a 2 day camping trip and I still had solid ice in it on the drive back I have to agree with some reviews that the handles are latch feel a lot more flimsy than my parents old mintcoloured coleman icechest and I miss the beer openers on the handles too Fix this and Id give it 5star Tip put water in a 9x13 cake pan and freeze it I used about 4 of those as ice blocks and they fit perfectly in the bottom and along the sides 
Great cooler keeps things refrigerator cold for many many hours 
Worked great  we were envied on the beach As people strolled by heard the comment Theyve got it made  Used it almost every day for 2 weeks on the beach in Maine  UPDATE 2 yrs of using this daily on a Maine beach and still works great  and still having people come up to us and ask where we bought it Amazon of course  
Once we got used to putting it togetherits a breeze Love it Offers great shade and a cool breeze with the window open in the backalso great privacy for changingbreast feeding with the front side which zips up Small light and easy to carryWeve used it for two years and still in awesome shape 
For the money this is a little tent that is tough to beat Can be a little tricky learning to set it up the first time The two possible negatives are that The tent is a little small We used it on a beach trip and really only two people can fit in it Also the pole connection is very tight so if you do not keep the sand out it can be a pain to get the poles to connect or disconnect We used to have a Lightspeed tent which was much simpler to set up but that broke very quickly After reseach we settled on this tent and are very happy with the investment Material strengh of tent itself is first rate Also it does well in the wind 
Has made a great difference in keeping our campsite organized 
Worked well for a short while but ended up tearing after 34 uses 
They are a bit small cannot get a skillet inside flat Cleans up fast 
Nice 
split a little after a few times of usage 
This cooler is very well made and will stand up to pretty much anything you would expect a cooler to endure I use this cooler for camping mostly and it is reasonably light but built well enough to use as a chair or step stool in a pinch I use this cooler for our food and after filling it and packing with ice it will retain about 50 of the ice for about three days in 65  85 deg weather You can get a better cooler but you will spend 3 times a much I would recommend this for anyone looking for a solid cooler for years to come 
There are quite a few VERY HIGH quality ice chest on the market today so take your time and do your home work before you do the click an ship part of your purchase 
Metal and heavy duty plastic construction Heavy duty metal handles and well designed strong latch Its a Coleman Pay the extra premium over pure plastic coolers  this will last much longer 
Great for camping packs light really appreciated having it for Labor Day weekend trip 
It works if you bring the water to it dont take it to a water source not sturdy enough to carry easily with water in it 
Nice heavy duty thick plastic but it folds down flat to go in camping gear Does exactly what it suppose to and is built to last 
love easy to do dishes while camping and i cook for at least 2030 every time we go this sink has held up well and i love it 
There was a small leak between the two sinks Aside from that its great Its useful enough that Im probably going to get a second one to have two sinks but it would have been nice to have it just a little better 
A little smaller then it should be might be able to wash one plate at a time better than nothing though Not great for a long term camp site would be great for back packing 
I think that we would rather have something that springs open and easily slides back into a small package but this works great I just need to convince everyone to use it Its easy enough to set up and the bag is quite small Its bigger than it looks in the picture and holds up to wind very well 
what a nice product thanks Thats what I wanted  
This is awesome Had it on the grass and at the beach already both on windy days The mesh that the poles run thru is annoying especially when breaking it down 
Long usage and great cooler for the price over time the sides started to delaminate not sure if I would buy another newer coleman again 
Not quite like the one I remember my folks having back in the 80sbut solid nice and nostalgic Heyif the new swivel latch keeps a child from asphyxiating in a cooler I can live with it  even if its not quite as snug as the old version I really wish theyd put a threadon drain cap on these Id have no hesitation at all about anyone 250 sitting on this around camp Some crediblelooking online reviews also had this rated in terms of ice retention right up there with coolers that cost as much as a healthy mortgage payment 
Best cooler ever I already had the stainless steel one but have always wanted coleman to come out with an all black one and they did I only wished that there wasnt any white showing but thats ok Ill take it 
A little flimsy but otherwise as described 
Okay trouble with folddown 
This was a great purchase It goes up easily and provides great shade for the little ones We were even able to bring in a small blow up kiddie pool to keep the kids in the shade while they played Its big enough for two adults to sit comfortably with small children Very easy to take down as well and the stakes keep it secure in the sand even when the wind picks up 
This is very convenient One to wash one to clean and easy to fold and store for our next camping trip A 
Small 
great for camping and other multiple uses like washing clothes and baby bath 
works great Perfect camping sink and it folds up too carried in a pack 
makes the beach more enjoyable 
Good product for the price Easy setup if your not doing it in the wind then you need two people Good space inside for me wife daughter and dog 
Use it now to soak my feet in Coconut Oil other side to wash When go camping will clean it with bleachsoap  water for dishes 
Started leaking almost immediately Thin cheap useless 
Very useful to have around Used it to wash hands and utensils while cooking to keep food from cross contamination Useful item to have while camping 
Love it Easy to use 
I have loved and recommended every Coleman product I have ever bought  except this one It does get really soft and pliable when filled with warm water which isnt the worst problem Its made to be collapsible so you are trading portability for some sturdiness But after 2 uses the whole thing started ripping in all the corners So bummed but I kind of expected it after reading the reviewsI was just hoping it would last a little longer as we dont go camping a whole lot 
We live in Maine and have taken this to the beach twice Once we figured out how to put it up first time was a learning experience it was easy the second time It stands up well to wind The last time we went it was really windy but it held just fine It is also easy to take down and put away We are always able to get it back into the bag even though you would swear it was impossible  it does take two of us though It is a great shelter to get out of the sun WE were able to stay at the beach much longer because we could get relief when we needed it I would imagine that this would be great for someone with little kids 
Over a year and a half ago my wifes extended family had a beach trip planned in 2014 This was before my wife was even pregnant Fast forward to a few months ago we were concerned about sun exposure with our daughter who would be 4 months old by the time we would use this tent Our pediatrician gave us 2 guidelines 1 Limit all sun exposure if possible 2 If 1 is not possible then use baby sunscreen but try to not use it until shes 6 months old By those 2 guidelines I started searching all over for some kind of protection on the beach I originally saw thenbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefSportBrellaUmbrellaPortableSunandWeatherShelterdpB002CLQ1T4refcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTF8SportBrella Umbrella  Portable Sun and Weather Shelteranbspat a local store They had it set up on display but there were a few things I didnt like about it First it seemed too low on the ground I know that 90 of the time I will be sitting down in it but it just seemed too low when using beach chairs with a fairly tall adult Secondly there is no bottom on it Its open to the ground So whatever you place the SportBrella on you need to lay down some towels tarp or something else unless you want your butt on the ground In my case it would be the sand Lastly I didnt like that the SportBrella didnt have the ability to close Its wideopen design meant that the usage for shade was limited to the sun movement and there was no privacy Meaning when my baby is trying to sleep or if Im changing herchanging my clothes then its wide open for everyone to see So thats when I started looking for alternatives and saw the Coleman Beach Shade After reading a couple reviews and seeing pictures of other buyers who also had babies with it I was sold The tent is plenty big enough Fully assembled with the front flap down  anchored as seen in the picture it can easily accommodate two adults and a baby with plenty of space for a diaper bag cooler etc With front flap up an adult and a baby can easily lay down on their backs with it With the design you get plenty of sun protection via the shade  SPF fabric The ability to open the rear for venting air or even as an exit is a nice touch It doesnt get too hot in there and while on the beach there was a nice breeze flowing through the tent Also I LOVED that it came with both stakes AND sandbags for options to anchor the tent down My only complaint about the tent is that when assembling it can take a little while to put together When trying the first time it can easily take you 20 minutes to put it together It definitely becomes easier if you have a second person Ive assembleddisassembled this tent at least a dozen times now and although I get better at it with each try it still takes time to put together Ive shaved my time down to about 810 minutes With the tent you get 3 poles The 2 shorter black poles run from front to back The long gray pole runs across the two black poles Once the poles are installed you fit each end into a grommet at the base of the tent The problem is that the long gray pole gets caught on the mesh fabric regardless of whether youre assembling or disassembling the tent Part of the reason it gets caught is because the poles can collapse This is part of the reason howwhy the tent can fit in the carry bag When shoving the rod through the mesh or pulling sometimes the pole collapses and you have to fix it This is why its so hard to put the tent together And because of that I dock it one star Overall I love this tent and would gladly recommend it to anyone looking for shade on the beach especially those with babies 
So far so good This beach shade is easy to use and is compact enough to stow with your other beach stuff 
Makes washing up when camping more convenient 
This is an awesome camping sink easy to clean and pack up when not in use 
Super simple setup has Rigid plastic rods at the ends to keep it up Material is thick Stands up fine with any amount of water Is a bit tricky to fold back up  hard to move if its full of water But has served it purpose 
No leaks a little precarious to carry but if you dont fill the bin to the top with water you wont have any issues with carrying We loved having the two bins one side with the dirty dishes and water and the other side with clean water for rinsing It was perfect Based on other reviews I looked carefully at how it was folded before opening it up Once I took notice of the folds I have had no issues refolding it to store Good addition to car camping 
perfect camping accesory compact yet ample room when in use 
Awful Very flimsy 
Cons  The drain is a simple cap held on by friction A cooler this size really needs a screw on cap Childproofing the lid has made the closing latch almost useless The closing latch completely failed in one summer season The cooler never left the safety of my truck bed and belted in place I absolutely will not purchase this item again 
Looks like the old time cooler Except for the can opener We love this for all our trips Keeps everything cold 
I use an ice chest every day and bought it hoping it would do a better job of keeping things cold without giving up storage space I am very pleased Ice stays frozen twice as long The latches work well handles are strong I cant find anything I dont like about it 
I left a shorter review of this cooler earlier but after further use wanted to return to leave a more comprehensive review INTRODUCTION I purchased this cooler on the recommendation of a friend who had several at a tailgate party I attended After searching around for the best price I settled on purchasing the green colored cooler which was the cheapest at the time from Amazon As a prime eligible purchase it arrived two days later in perfect condition Absolutely no dings scratches or dents like other reviews mention It was perfectly packaged in factory boxes APPEARANCE The cooler is plastic encased in steel The colored portion you see is steel whereas the white portion is plastic Some people seem to believe this cooler is all steel It is not It is steel belted as the description clearly states The latch is metal and plastic The handles are also metal but with plastic grips The coolers appearance is stylish Also there is NO bottle opener on this version of the cooler Some reviews allude to the presence of a bottle opener on the outside of the cooler There is certainly not one on the version I ordered FUNCTIONALITY AND USE Hands down this is the best cooler I have ever owned I take a lot of road trips and travel a lot for work and used to carry along an old generic plastic cooler with me to keep snacks water and soda This cooler has replaced my old beat up travel buddy It fits nicely in the back of my Ford Escape and has more then enough storage space for meats cheese bread yogurt fruit beer and ice I can stock it with enough food for a 35 day trip easily The cooler keeps ice for about two to three days outside of extreme temperatures Two or three two liter bottles of ice are enough to keep everything cold for at least 2 says If necessary the ice can be supplemented with a bag of two from the motel to get you through the last day or two of your trip I do not use the chemical ice packs except one small one see below but they might last a little longer Now just one thing to consider before you purchase this item The cooler can get heavy especially when fully loaded Of course it depends on what you put in the cooler but I have loaded mine up to what was probably more then fifty pounds That can be a lot of weight to carry especially longer distances Unless you are a large burly man dont plan on carry this cooler fully loaded around all day long The plastic grips do a good job of stopping the handles from cutting into your hands when carrying and it is on the heavy side To get around this limitation I keep a small cold pack in the cooler and a small insulated bag I got as a freebie at a convention Whenever I need to take something from the car to a different location and do not want to lug the entire cooler I just place what I need in the insulated bag with the cold pack TIPS 1 Dont waste your money buying bagged ice at convenience stores Fill recycled two liter bottles 34 way full of water and freeze them Use these bottles as ice packs It will not only save you the mess of melted ice but also a few dollars because you wont have to buy ice 2 Make sure to chill everything that will go in the cooler at least overnight This will help extend the life of the ice in the cooler 3 It is useful to keep something like a bottle opener or cork screw in your cooler Even a small folding knife can be a lifesaver when you need to cut open a package or some food CONCLUSION This cooler is well worth the money Yes you can find cheaper alternatives in stores and online But the value of this cooler cannot be surpassed You may save a few dollars by buying a generic plastic cooler but those savings will quickly be lost with all your ice purchases and loss of food due to heat 
Its frustrating to figure out how to repack flat 
small dishes only 
I mostly burst into flames at the beach so when my girlfriend suggested we get something like this for the upcoming family beach day I was relieved and immediately ordered it from Amazon It arrived on time as usual and we did a dry run in the back yard I figured that was better than breaking up in front of her family at the beach if it were really hard to put together One pass over the instructions  which are cleverly attached to the case so they cant be lost  and I was on my way It probably too me ten minutes the first time but it wasnt that difficult at all The most difficult part was putting it back in the case But we all know that these things never go back in there the way they were Beach day came a couple of days later and it was time for the true test I was worried about the stakes not staying in the beach sand but they performed fine It was a little tougher to assemble on the beach than it had been in the back yard due to the wind and sand but I had experience on my side and it was up in no time We convinced the kids that filling the included sand bags was a game so that pretty much took care of itself I did end up spilling one of the sand bags inside of the shade I wish the drawstrings had some kind of tension closure I think next time Ill bring Ziploc bags to put inside of the sandbags Or I could just be more careful There were other variants of this nearby on the beach so I got to watch their experience They mostly went up faster but seemed to not store as compactly They also either did not offer as much coverage or didnt have the complete zip up feature like the Coleman did I ended up changing inside of this one which was a neat feature The kids enjoyed getting inside and zipping it up also Though out in the sun it got very hot very quickly with the zipper closed I can see how the wind could be an issue but if you open the back window it seems to pass through Overall the shade was awesome and just what I needed Almost everyone ended up in it at some point One of the kids took a nap in it when the others werent using it as a beach fort My girlfriend took a nap in it I spent much of my time avoiding spontaneous combustion in there It did fill up with sand pretty easily but its the beach what are ya gonna do I have four improvements that it could use 1 Two more stakes to hold the front flap down  Ill probably end up buying some because i didnt like that it was just loose 2 The lack of side windows made it a little isolating when inside the shade 3 The guides for the poles are mesh which makes them hard to thread the poles through though I can see some benefit of mesh 4 Sandbags that seal better All of these are minor and this is an awesome product 
These are great for camping They eventually start ripping along the seems each seem is reinforced with a bar of plastic a little but for the price they are really useful Personally I have 3 sets of these I use one set for storing the dirty dishes used after a meal then 1st bay is for grosse decontamination rinse off all of the food 2nd is for washing 3rd is for rinsing off the soapy water 4th is for clean rinse You can do it with fewer  but Im kind of a clean plate decontamination freak 
The idea of this wash basin is perfect but the practical use of it when camping is only okay Id still recommend it though because when you go camping you are not allowed to wash your dishes in the restrooms or by the water so this really is better than nothing Id like it a little bigger because I had a lot of dishes to clean when we went camping 
What a waste of money First use at camping and both sides leaked 
Too small and overpricedcomplete waist of money 
Works well 
This was just what we needed Before we were at the water doing our dishes but with this we set it up on the picnic table Carry water to it Filled it up and washed away Can use it for dishes or just general washing It folds right back up after your done I would recommend 
This is an awesome little sink Keep in mind that it is quite small would work great for backpacking We used it with our trailer so we could do the dishes at the back of the trailer using the outside shower so we didnt make a huge mess inside It was really nice to have the extra room and people helping to clean up It also made it easy to clean as you go If you are looking for something to use heavily I would recommend two medium sized plastic bins but if you just want something to do some light cleaning this worked great 
This item is well built and all the components seem of high quality It could have gotten 5 stars if the instructions were a little more clear Setting it up the first time can be trying 
Used this for the first time yesterday straight out of the box Easy setup only problem is the poles have a tendency of getting snagged on the mesh of the tubes I accidently set the tent up backwards but I realized that I liked it better that way because I could keep the screen side zipped up to contain my toddler but wed still be able to see everything going on outside Like others said it does get hot inside and it would be nice to have some side ventilation too Overall it rocks Though you may want to get some better stakes because mine bent even though they were just pushed into soft dirt 
I wanted a super rugged cooler what I got was a cooler that was expensive and looks rugged The surface that gets the most wear is plastic and the metal wrapping is paper thin disappointed 
Leaked on first use I rarely return items purchased from Amazon but after only one try this ones going back 
ok got it in never used it but just by looking at it I can tell you it is cheap looking I do not think this would hold up with the water to wash dishes for a two week camping trip but maybe for one day  if that long I am tell you do not waste your money on it it is cheaply made and not worth it 
The buckets leak into each other it was tiny and very flimsy 
Came in with holes It should be fine without the holes but that bothered me so much that I will stay away from this Coleman cheap stuff 
Purchased at Walmart Worked as expected no issues use on flat surface not bench of picnic table as will slide off Folds up for backpacking trips Excellent productbeen hikingcamping for 25 years Expect it to last but would buy another in an instant Highly recommend this product Kids washed faces hands husband shaved in it Tossed it in the pack and away we went 
It held ice for over 24 hrs looks amazing and is solid The latch is a little flimsy but Coleman has many replacement parts if needed When you pull your cold PBR out of this bad boy at the beach you will have major cooler envy and people will automatically flock to you and ask to be your friend AMERICA 
I wanted a small basin to use under the faucet in the campsite to avoid getting mud and water running everywhere whenever we washed our hands or anything This was better as it was collapsible and easy to pack in my box with the camp grill It is made of thick plastic the kind that they cover brand new sofas in But its plastic nonetheless so expect it to soften up in the heat science especially when using hot water Luckily for me Im not fond of hot water as they burn  dry my hands really bad so this plastic basin works perfectly for me  my family 
It is what it is works very well 
This product wouldve been great bec the sides stayed up even without water but when I filled 1 part with water it leaked to the other side That was the first use and we didnt even use hot water So I cant use this to wash  rinse dishes since the dirty water will flow to the clean water Ill have to get another wash basin for that 
I love this cooler period It reminds me of the kind of coolers we had when I was a kid And made in the USA 
i returned not made with the same durability as in the past the cooler does not suction shut their is play even when the latch is locked i sent it back 
I purchased two without doing my homework boy do I regret it Yes it is very cool looking but very poorly constructed The latch broke off is unfixable and drain is easily pulled out causing water to leak at inconvenient time Truly this cooler was used twice once for a day boat trip and an overnight camping trip thats it I was going to give second one as wedding gift but dont feel right given experience with mine Contacting Coleman is not worth your time I am stuck No recourse Bought from vendor on Amazon they wont return because it has been two weeks past a year DO NOT BUY 
I love going to the beach but I dont love roasting in the sun I can spend all day as long as I have shade I had a smaller earlier type of beach shade but the real shade is rather small This is amazingly roomy and I can sort of stand up in it if I wanted to Im only 5 2 though I really like the big back doorwindow for ventilation Ive seen cheaper versions of this style now but they often dont have windows or only small ones Plus I realized that I can simply clothespin a towel or sarong to the front for a little lower shade if I need to Also has a line for drying items but its inside of the entrance and I would think if youre drying a towel the water would just drip inside Also has sand bags a permanent instruction sheet attached to the carry case and pegs Simple to set up I am very happy with this 
Worked great for a recent beach trip Easy to set up plenty of room and vented to allow the breeze through 
Minimal effort to put together and very hand place to hide from the sun when you want to stay on the beach without getting burnt 
No better way to wash your dishes while camping if you ask me It worked great was easy to fill dump and dries quickly Never leaked Plastic seems very strong and folds flat when you are done with it 
We set up this sink We were very disappointed the unit leaked right away and could not be repaired Hard to find out while out on the road 
I have not had the opportunity to use it yet My vacation is not until July but am looking forward to washing dishes at Yosemite 
This started to leak on our third camping trip so that there were no longer two separate sections We ended up throwing it away and buying a 10L sink from REI 
This is a great wash tub for camping or boating I used to use a bucket and then just rinse the stuff off with a hose What a pain in the neck This is great for washing all kinds of things Be careful with knives and sharp grill tongs I almost put a hole in the side The material is thicker so it maintains it shape while filled with water Very happy with the product and I love the fact that it folds up because storage is always an issue on my boat 
Works great for washing pots and pans We even left it with soapwater and clean water just in case somebody had to wash their hands Wife loved it 
I got this wash basin in preparation for a camping trip in April The basin collapses on itself so if youre a cartent camper like me you have room for this in transit can leave it out at the camp to dry outits really useful Just pop this guy open fill with warm water add a squirt of soap to one side and get the dishes done in no time I did learn to leave the basin on the picnic table if the water is particularly warm we were heating up some tap water over the fire to get the water to the point where it would clean the dishes to a campclean level and the ambient temperature was in the 40s  I wanted to dump the warm water picked up the basin and the PVC was soft enough that it started to bulge Just didnt think that through so I set the basin back down with the water in it and let it cool It was totally fine went back to its original shape for the most part and still folded up well  we used it 3x per day over 3 days and it performed very well The next test will be on the NEXT camping trip in a few monthsto see if it still unfolds and performs as well after storage Given the price even if it fails Id replace it for its utility and low space requirements with one of the same 
it is required to have the same quality is very good easy to clean also and easy to carry all time 
The cooler does a good job of keeping its contents cool We have had the cooler for four years The only problem we have encountered was the separation of the seamed side of the cooler from the insulation The separation seems not to affect the insulative properties of the cooler Coleman suggested that heat might have caused the insulation to expand and cause the separation Four stars instead of five because of this bulging 
The pugs and I love this cooler  The ice last all weekend long for our camping trips and 4 day travels on the road Keeps our food chilled and sodawater cold Always wanted a metal cooler just like my Dad and Grandpa still have 
I purchased this cooler for my husband for his birthday If I would have gotten it elsewhere I would have paid WAY over 100 Because I bought it on Amazoncom I paid WAY under and did not even have to pay for the shipping It is the best steelbelted cooler on the market and my husband was VERY pleasantly surprised He had been wanting one all his life I not only surprised him but made him very happy too 
This is a great unit for the camping kitchen it holds the hot  cold water and moves very easy with the handles The only downfall I have is trying to fold it back up after using other than that its great You do need to be careful if you have sharp utensils because even though it is thick PVC it can still get punctured 
We used our wash basin on a recent camping trip and it made cleanup a whole lot easier Putting hot water on one side to rinse the dishes makes my wife very happy 
My fist camping trip isnt until March 15 so as soon as Im back Ill be able to give a better review on my product 
Keeps ice stuff stays cold One note it isnt like the all metal cooler my grandfather had bought about 50 years ago This is a modern plastic cooler wrapped in steel with Coleman on it I do miss the bottle opener on the ends The one he had you could set a grenade off next to it and it would have survived Dont get me wrong I like the cooler but Im old enough to remember the all metal ones from years ago 
After having a number of plastic coolers I opted for the classic Coleman Steel cooler Although heavier than plastic it is more sturdy and appears to keep the contents cooler much longer Would recommend to anyone 
As my title says this worked far better than I expected for my wife lol No seriously the material is heavier than expected and it made cooking clean ups much quicker than in the past This is a must have for you next outing 
I just purchased the 54 quart stainless steel belted chest cooler The lid latch does not hold the lid down tight and there is no tray in the cooler like the old ones I am quite disappointed with the product 
Our family goes camping about once a month and in the South Texas summers that means keeping anything cold for very long is a real challenge We had one of the other famous brands plastic coolers but by the end of day two we had nothing but cool water sloshing around in the bottom of it I bought this one two trips ago and absolutely love it We put a 20lb bag of ice in one our way out of town Friday afternoon and still have 15lb in it for the drive home Sunday night On the downside its extremely heavy and has no wheels It also dents pretty easily 
No complaints It is what it is  a highend cooler that keeps cold stuff cold Steel does conduct heat so dont be a doofus and leave it sitting in the sun Bonus point for the locking latch Youll appreciate that when you drop the cooler and it rolls off the trail and down the hill but all of your chow stays locked inside Aside from camping we used this cooler to store the contents of our refrigerator during a recent longterm power outage If there was a bigger version Id buy it too 
I love that it packs up compactly and saves space The bins arent very big so if its just a few people using it youre fine but if youre trying to do a whole scout troop its a bit small On the first use it got pretty greasy on the inside and left a nasty film I was able to clean that off with spray cleaner at home and will likely do some more washing before we use them again I am not sure if that was just what was washed in it or if it was adding hot water to them and the plastic did something Like I said I got that off so it was likely just what was being washed Its also a little awkward to carry to empty and takes two people so you dont spill the water Overall Id buy it again given the convenience of the space saving feature 
great foldable wash basin for travelling light its durable and cheap cole man really knows how to come up with camping gear 
Didnt expect this to be as thick as it is but its nice quality yet still flexible and lightweight enough for the kitchen pack Im happy with the quality 
Its okay in a pinch to let dishes soak to remove caked on food in a camping setting It is smaller than the picture looked and its also more flimsy than  expected I would like to see this in a bigger size 
Ive been waiting for these to become available again I remember when they first came out in 2001 as the special 100th aniversary limited edition My neighbor got one in the Spring and I was so impressed with how well the cooler kept beverages cold I just had to get one Alas they sold out so quickly and it seemed that whenever one was available somewhere itd be gone before I could get it Id been looking to get one from Amazon since last year and again the frenzy from everyone wanting them kept causing this cooler to be sold out frequently I placed an order for it four 4 times and every time I thought Id be getting it an email would arrive a few days later stating the stock was depleted Well finally I saw them on Amazon again at a really good price too so I bought it and actually got one Now everyone that sees it marvels at the clean appearence and sharp looking design Not to mention how well it keeps MY beverages cold Needless to say Im pleased with the Coleman Steel Belted Cooler and plan on having it for years to come Now back to some yard work so I can enjoy a frosty cold beverage when Im done 
The Coleman 54 quart steelsided cooler immediately takes you back to a different time It is wonderfully built with metal handles riveted to the body of the unit The metal latch is a major plus as this cooler will do most of its duty for me riding in the back of a sidebyside While the price may initially scare some compare this cooler with other allplastic coolers of similar size The difference isnt much compared with what you get 
This basin is portable and holds water without leaking It was smaller than I thought it would be And the handles made me think it would be easy to transport water and dishes in it but the bottom is flimsy so I dont recommend it Works well for camping 
I took it on a 4 day camping trip By the end of the trip it was toast It slowly fell apart until it was useless Too bad I liked the idea of this It would be great if it could stay together 
Purchased this for car camping and even when using my camper as I cook and clean outside most of the time Little funky to refold after use It is rigid enough during use not to spill water If the plastic holds up and doesnt crack and leak this should be a great little item Only time and use can provide that answer At this point I am satisfied 
This works incredibly well I use for large group canoeing trips If you go out in groups of 6 or more this is the lightest most compact wash bin you can find I am talking backcountry trips where you must carry everything you bring this is worth the weight It makes cleanup a snap and conservest water Worth the weight even for large backpacing groups 
I camp ALL The timewanted something for doing dishes now that I am back to tenting this lasted ONE wash cycle split apart Crappy 
This was handy and compact We went camping and where able to keep our dishes clean this way It doesnt really keep the soapy water out from the other side but you get the dishes clean 
We bought this on Amazon about a year ago and have been very happy We like it so much we are going to buy a second one We have a tear drop camp trailer The stainless matches to tear drop stainless and keeps with the retro look LOOKS This is one of those coolers that people comment on and we get questions about on occasion because it is cool looking We go on short and sometimes extended camping trips Last year this cooler consistently out performed our other plastic cooler The SS Coleman with a single bag of ice keeps everything milk eggs veggies etc cold for over a week easily We do take precautions to keep it in the shade but you should do that anyway We have found it durable the lid closes tight and have had no problems with the hinges handles or anything else We are very satisfied with it and would recommend 
Very handy and easy to set up The clear plastic makes it very easy to use The bars are not fixed to each other so you can fold it easily 
Its compactable and very light weighted It was of great help on my last camping trip and will never go on another without it I recommend this item 
This is a great cooler It holds a ton is strong and takes banging around It is good for dragging stuff for a family outing to the park or for car camping Not a backpackable cooler mind you but this is the heirloom cooler you will want for decades We use ours as a minifridge in a lake cabin and it keeps stuff cold with occasional changes of ice or cooler blocks 
When Coleman designed this cooler they left off a way to stop the lid from opening past 90ish degrees This results in the lid opening about 180 degrees which stresses the hinges and breaks the outer stainless layer away from the inner insulation I have been through two lids and now the body of the cooler is breaking away the same way Yes it does have a 100 year warranty but I bought expecting the same build quality as my grandfathers that is 60 years old There is just no comparison Coleman also says it will keep ice for 3 days at 100 degrees This couldnt be further from the truth It will not hold ice for 24 hours at 85 degrees Bottom line Buy a good Igloo marine cooler and use the extra 70 to fill it with your beverage of choice 
Great game very good set 
Gotta have bocce on hand These are great well made balls Great set with a string and measure for close calls 
I bought this set about 2 months ago and have played numerous times on the grass and on the beach I like the weight of this set It has a lot of heft to it and it comes with a palino and a measuring string The bag is well constructed and they included a simple foam insert that allows you to neatly stack the balls in the bag My old set did not have it and the balls would not stack properly and the bag eventually broke I also like the bright colors and that it comes with 4 different colors that allow up to 4 people to play It is well worth the price 
Lightweight yet held up to handle all dish washing needed Sides held up great despite what some other reviewers say they may have had issues with 
I have used this on several trips including group camping with the cub scouts Though I do not let anyone wash knives in it but me I have found this ti be a very effective tool 
My friend had this on a recent camping trip and I just had to buy one I love this wash basin After meals we would pile the dishes in and I would carry it down the road to wash everything Its easy to clean out and very sturdy If you are a camper youll love this We just started camping as a family and I am trying to purchase things a little at a time but this was very affordable 
The tent finally arrived by UPS at 325pm I set it up in the yard without even reading the instructions taking care to heed the advice of others to be GENTLE in the process and broke it down and packed it away in about 25 minutes time Alone Thats right by 350 pm with four hours left of sunlight I was on my way to the beach Either the beach is too sunny too windy or both On this occasion the winds were blowing 8 mph with gusts of 15 mph I set my lunch pack just inside the screen door to weigh the fabric down as I went through the steps I had practiced during the test run I experienced zero issues I used the spikes which were okay Its important to angle them with the wind I think I will tie ribbon on them like another user suggestes for next time so they dont get lost or if I decide to use the sand bags I will bring ziplock bags to keep the sand from sifting out There are mesh pockets inside the tent for said bags but I think other people have tied them to the outside of the tent and buried them This setup took under 10 minutes I think the more patient and methodical your strategy the quicker it goes up If you happen to have ill tempered kids I would increase the difficulty 5x per infant 20x per toddler 10x per child maybe I strongly advise all parents to get to the beach by 8am before the sun starts turning the family into savages And please for the love of all keep your garbage and kids toys in check Moving along Winds kicked up to 10  15mph with gust of 20mph at by the time I left at sundown The tent went back into its bag just as fine as any pushing down with your knees while the bag is on its side helps heeding the warnings of others to be careful not to catch fabric in the zipper The stakes poles and sandbags have their own bags so I didnt bother trying to fit those right away Although once home I fit those in just fine as well Loses one star because it could have a more durable floordoor and perhaps more ventelation options on the sides I am so happy that I didnt pay mind the reviews of people who couldnt figure this thing out edited to be less condescending to people who have trouble with this tent 
The supplied stakes worked fine in the coarse sand and wind at the beach this summer We did not need to use the instructions to set up the tent and it stood up well for out beach trip 
If it were a popup tent it would be perfect Takes a little getting used to setting up and isnt instant by any means but a great tent with good protection Im a ginger Love the piece of fabric that juts out of the front too Keeps you legs from getting sandy or grassy 
i remember I had one of these years ago and it kept my stuff Ice Cold and kept the ice for days This Cooler is no exception It was put to the ultimate test a camping trip in 100 temps It kept the food cold and the ice stayed Well worth the money over the other coolers out there if you do a lot of camping or are an outdoors person 
Very nice I got one of these on the gold box special last week and paidwell I aint gonna tell ya what I paid because so many people bitch about the gold box I will say that it was delivered today 53107 in perfect condition Ebay has a few as I type this One of them was only used twice and the bid was up over what I paid Either way this is still worth the regular price My wife prefers coolers with rollers I agree But for that special occasion cookout with guests whathaveyou this is retro cool As a weekly cooler for trekking back and forth to the RV nah But for that price ofoh yeah Cant give away secrets I will say that it sold out immediately and Amazon released a few more which I luckily caught I should have ordered a couple Nice product for the money even at this price which is not bad with 0 tax and free shipping Ahhhwhat the heck Just to show you that checking the gold box daily is more profitable than reading your local rag of a bad news paper5999 and free shipping Check the box 
Its been a long time since I bought this and I still get asked to bring it to the beach with friends It is really standing the test of time 
Well made  very fun 
Great Buy as expected 
this coleman pvc double wash basinis perfect because you can wash and rinse on sitegreat for tent campingso buy it 
Leaked on first use I had to patch the pvc The way the PVC is stored leads to creases and tears I believe the tear in the PVC was made prior to my receiving the product 
In the picture they show a bunch of dishes in the thing I dont know where they got them but my plates and stuff are much larger than theirs My stuff barely fits into this thing 
Love Coleman Products Wonderful products great customer support Been using Coleman for 30 years never disapointed Would recomend this product for all 
The first time I used it I swore there was a leak Somehow the leak stopped from that point on it worked as intended and I like the size when you compact it 
What a buy Ice chest looks great Im sure it will hold up to many years of use I purchased this as a Christmas present for my husband He was very happy to receive it We learned all too well after hurricane Katrina that ice just doesnt last in a regular ice chest Hopefully we will be more prepared if ever in that situation again We havent tested it out yet but people I know say that ice will last 3 days in this type ice chest 
I own this cooler circa 1968 It is bombproof and looks like it survived a tour in Vietnam but we haul this bad boy out each summer because it does the job The cam lock on the lid keeps it from flying free if jarred or jostled this is a very good thing if you take it fishing and have your catch inside Construction is good enough to last near 40 years of use before considering a replacement It really will survive that many seasons of use which is more than you can say for many fragile thermoplastic knockoffs There are few camping or summertime essentials that can be universally adopted but the Coleman steel cooler has to be one Bring it on your next outing and even if you have boring cans of Diet Coke inside people will stop to check it out Fred 
So much fun to play with friends and family 
I bought this for bad weather soccer games It isnt quite big enough to fit two camp chairs inside I used it recently at the beach and the strong winds broke one of the support rods I am hoping I can repair it because I have a lot of use planned with this shade 
I have had this wash basin for about 2 years now and have used probably over 30 times It is very convenient because it allows you to have hot soapy water on one side and plain water for rinsing The sides stay up with no problems while in use It is easy to carry the plastic is durable and it folds up nicely I would suggest not to put any sharp knives in it as it could be punctured Also I just noticed after our last trip that one of the black plastic rods has slipped out because the plastic on the bottom of it has separated Not a big deal but I will have to keep an eye on it to make sure the rip doesnt spread 
We used this with a Coleman Hot Water machine in our SUV tent Just like having a regular sink Very handy cheap and easy to use 
It made washing up great with two bins I also liked how compact it is saves space Great product for us 
My son has a tear drop trailer This portable sink is the perfect ticket to wash up or do the dishes 
No more walking to the bath house to wash dishes or waiting until you get home to wash a ton of stuff from camping This was perfect I suggest filling with a bucket on the disired location if not you need two people to carry Not because its heavy but because the center will dip and pour 
This is a very well built product Its lightweight and folds up nicely It can also be used as a food and water bowl for the dogs or for soaking your feet very roomy 
I am the envy of my family camping trip I SO LOVE this sink it was a great asset to our camping trip even the kids wanted to wash the dishes LOL LOVE it 
It was a good idea and it worked well the first camping trip we took But the next trip only a few months later wasnt so great first one side started to leak and then a couple days later the second side started It split were the pvc folds I was hoping it would have lasted longer than that Like I said it was a good idea just not durable 
Took them camping and they worked well and when finished they folded up and easy to store  Little space required 
I havent used this yet but it looks like it will be very useful when we go camping this summer 
I have yet to use this item but it appears to be much heavier and more durable than similar camp basins Ive bought in the past Im looking forward to trying it out 
Best Bocce ball set I have ever played with 
Good set 
While at first glance these looked to be of high quality after just a few plays they have chipped and scarred very easily I have owned several bocce sets and these are the worst 
When we finally moved into a house with a backyard larger than a postage stamp we wanted a simple way to take advantage of it on a nice summer day Bocce ball is very much like shuffleboard or bowling some people take it way too seriously but for the rest of us its a fun and easy game to play with a group of nonpros The balls are heavy and resilient We have had them bash together from some overlyaggressive tosses and none of them have cracked or chipped The measuring string is a bit cheap but it works perfectly fine for the tooclosetotell shots and has little knots to make measuring easier The case is strong enough to lug the set around it and includes a divider to keep the bottom layer and top layer from banging against each other or shifting around in the bag All in all I have zero complaints with this set and it has served us well even on our outofregulation backyard 
Very heavy Great for adults  pros Live the marker 
Just how lazy can you get I just want to make sure everything gets squeaky lean I hate dried foods on my plates 
So I was very happy with the size and the concept of the sink I liked the portability of it as well What I didnt care for was the durability By the end of 4 days sitting in one place at the site the plastic braces started to separate from the sides The only movement it got was from being carried away from camp and being dumped The sink was only a quarter full and not really heavy so it wasnt abused by any stretch of the imagination I will buy some cheap Wally World totes to replace it when it fails completely 
I bought this for my scouts it was far too small to wash anything bigger than silverware and one of the legs broke before then even filled it with water the first time Since they were also limited to cold water because the material gets soft when on contact with heat I decided to go back to my 5gal bucket wash system 
We loved this item I found it to be quite sturdy and roomy enough to wash all our camp dishes One small pot of boiling water added to about 14 full compartment of cold water made a very nice warm wash and then just pop the cleaned dishes into the other rinse side and there you go Then when you are done just dump it out and fold it up and it is out of the way and not taking up much room I was afraid after reading some of the other reviews that it would not be sturdy enough to carry water from the spigot back to the campsite so I used another container to do that however after walking it a distance to dump it out I think it would be fine 
This fold up sink is AWESOME I did not have a single problem with it Totally exceeded my expectations The only tip I can provide for future buyers is to only fill up each sink with half water otherwise you may have a problem transporting it while it has water in it I love it 
This simple little sink was absolutely great for a camping trip We heat hot water and pour in each side wash and rinse Held up great and makes it so easy to wash dishes right there at the camp table Everyone raved about it another little enhancement to our Coleman Camp site which consists of Coleman Stoves ten 1 Coleman Instant Tents in our group Coleman air mattresses double high queen and lanterns and LED string lights 
Great shelter for the beach for you or a baby or a pet  easy to set up and worth the price 
I always used one of the camp pots for a sink until I bought this item The PVC and plastic makes the sink light and collapsable Having a wash side and rinse side is very helpful Ive only filled the sides halfway because carrying this to a place to drain the water is a little challenging There are 3 handles that you need to hold with 2 hands or youll get dirty water everywhere Its a little tricky to do half filled and I havent tried it with the water level full but I imagine its a bit more difficult 
Nice sturdy set and a fun game to play 
great fun these are the really size and weight they are so heavy 
Love this Bocce set Its the 5th one I have purchased One for home one for the beach house and 3 for hosthostess gifts when going to stay at someones house Thanks Amazon to Prime I can ship this and have it arrive at my destination on the same day as I do and I didnt have to carry it on the plane 
I bought this a few weeks back for use on a cross country trip that included some car camping The first time this was taken out of the package it was purchased in was moments before it was used at the camp site After its first use we collapsed it up and packed it away The next time we used this we immediately it started leaking Upon closer inspection I found that the basin had developed tears at the bottom seams where the basin folds when you collapse it down for travel use Im a little disappointed that this would happen this quickly after use but I also understand that this sort of thing happens from time to time Since Im still in the midst of my vacation Ill have to find time to reach out to Coleman to see inquire what or how theyll address this Update 082615 After our first go round with this wash basin in 2011 I reached out to Coleman explaining the problem we encountered with the wash basin leaking and they replaced it as a one time courtesy be aware it doesnt carry a warranty Fast forward four years and the next time our family is camping and we open up the still new in package wash basin we received from Coleman we received in 2011 Immediately out of the package it starts leaking at the same points the previous one leaked which leads me to believe its a flaw in materials used to manufacture the wash basin For this reason I cannot see my self recommending this product to anyone If youre looking for camp wash basin consider other options For us we may consider using storage totes we travel with as wash basins on our next trip 
Wow I have to say my wife and I took a chance on this crossing our fingers and hoping that it would work and the gamble paid off Weve only used it on one camping trip so I cant speak to the long term durability of it However that one trip was for a week of tent camping and cooking three meals a day We used this every meal poured the near boiling steaming water that we heated from the camp fire in one side the cool water in the other and washed the dishes Never had a problem with it collapsing or buckling due to weight or heat I was nervous about putting the hot water in it but that all turned out fine Afterward it was folded up and tucked out of the way and out of sight I can remember camping with the boy scouts and hauling around hard plastic tubs for washing purposes this product is a dream come true for me 
Compact and easy to set up We kept this out the whole time to put dirty dishes in and then let clean dishes dry in the other side Pros Cheap heavy duty plasticcompactclear and great idea Cons Smalllike bathroom sinks no plug you have to dump the whole thing Bottom line for the price you wont find a better made prodct to do the job plus it folds away 
Great quality set Bocce is the perfect game to take with you to parks the beach or camping Its simple and fun for everyone This set has some serious heft to it These balls will standup to the severest abuse and not miss a beat 
Perfect 
High quality 
This thing leaks I ended up throwing it in the garbage awhile back after a couple of uses Ive gone back to using 2 plastic washtubs that dont take up that much more room assuming you use them to store stuff in them So for car camping I would go with something sturdier for sure 
I wish they were a bit bigger but other than that they are very useful We used to have to take up space with bigger bowls to do our washing in and these fold up basically flat and take up very little room 
Weve used this double wash basin for a total of 12 days of camping so far and have found it a useful addition to our camping gear I havent had problems with it collapsing or being punctured As others have said just be careful I also do not fill the basin and attempt to carry it I have a collapsible water jug that I use to carry water which is more suited to the task I have used hot water and found it to hold up perfectly well I am giving it only four stars because it is a bit small If it were a couple of inches larger it would fit plates and pots Perhaps Coleman could offer two sizes Overall its a great compromise between serviceability and packability 
I really liked the idea of this piece  went ahead and got it Definately works well I didnt have a problem at all with the sides collapsing and water flowing out Not sure what the other reviewr experienced or why but I found it to function just perfectly I did however have a hard time walking back from the water spigot at the camp site to our kitchen tent with the double sink filled I had to actually have someone else help me We use our camp kitchen sink to wash dishes one side of this collapsible sink to rinse and the other side we use with clean clear water  a capful of bleach to sanitize our dishware 
I was very satisfied with the quality and durability if this bocce ball set Weve had fun playing with it on the beach 
Here is a good sturdy medium strength shovel for just about any purpose you can have whether camping hiking for the car gardening etc This is the kind of personal shovel that is issued to military personnel It folds into a trinagle about 6Lx4Wx2H and when extended is about 10 long It has a ripple on one edge that is supposed to represent a saw built onto the blade This shovel is very good for chipping ice in the winter time when you get your vehicle stuck It is somewhat adequate for shoveling snow it gets the job done but that is not what it was designed for Have two vehicles and have one of these shovels in each Great for when you get stuck in any other type of soilterrain other than snow It is great for gardening camping and hiking If your are in a combat situation this shovel is great for digging that hasty fighting postion its intended purpose and then improve that position with a larger shovel This shovel also is great if you got to do the poo thing because you can dig a hole and fold the blade to a 90 degree position lock it in place set the handle on the ground with the 90 degree shovel standing up and sit on it to use as a seat Unfortunately you can only place one butt cheek on the blade that is all the room you have for It also makes for a good sturdy weapon against critters and such when extended It comes with a plastic container that attaches to your utility belt or backpack The uses for this shovel are only limited to your imagination The only thing that I can really say bad about this shovel is that makebelieve saw on one of the blades It is worthless and is a big joke Twenty years in the military using a shovel like this and not once was I able to saw through anything Guess it makes a good conversation piece around the camp fire 
Ive been wilderness camping for over 26 years When I first started as a Boy Scout a folding shovel was high on my list of must have camping gear After purchasing one however and carrying it with me on a number of outings I soon came to a different conclusion Why do most people want to carry a shovel I usually hear three reasons 1 to dig a trench around a tent 2 to shovel ash out of the fire pit and 3 to dig a scat hole a hole for depositing excrement Let me address those three items and then address some different types of camping or outings that may further influence your decision TRENCHING AROUND TENTS  Simply put this is an outdated practice that causes erosion in campsites Trenches eventually fill and overflow carrying off soil and altering the conditions in the site In fact most campsites and all National Parks and wilderness areas prohibit trenching If you really want the floor of your tent to stay dry on the inside purchase a tent with a tub floor where the seams are raised off the bottom of the tend and a good rain fly SHOVELING ASH  While a shovel can be used to shovel ash out of a fire pit so can small gargen trowel a metal cup a metal plate or even a frying pan Youre likely already going to be carrying a cup plate or pan so there is no need to carry the extra gear the shovel A large stick can be used to stir coals in an active fire and the cookware can be rinsed with water after using it to dig out the fire pit SCAT HOLES  When digging a hole for human waste you typically need to turn only a few inches of soil Ive found that a garden trowel does a splendid job and it weighs only a few ounces compared to the 24 lbs of this shovel DIFFERNT CAMPING METHODS REQUIRE DIFFERENT GEAR  Lets face it it makes a difference if you are driving into a campsite rather than hiking in If driving in you are less concerned about how heavy your gear is so a shovel like this one may be a nice luxury If backpacking or on any wilderness excursion where you are carrying everything you need you feel every extra ounce you carry In such cases a gardening trowel makes more sense You can get one made from composite plastics that is very hard and durable but weighs only a few ounces In my years of experience I found that the weight of the shovel was not worth the benefit I received from it while on wilderness treks However I love keeping one of these in the trunk of my car to help dig out if I get stuck in the snow The Coleman folding shovel is a nice little tool You just need to decide if you want to carry it with you when you spend time in the wilderness 
I took a camping trip last year and encountered a fire pit where the previous tenants didnt remove their ash waste and I was forced to waste nearly an hour cleaning it out I vowed I would never go through that again I went on a search for a armylike folding shovel without the cost as I would only be using it to clean fire pits upon arrival and departure However I also needed something that was easy to pack away as I drive a sportwagon style vehicle This shovel is perfect in nearly all ways I say nearly because no product is perfect and there will be some flaw that I dwell on its a bit difficult to fold initially but you get the hang of it that someone else wont It fits perfectly in my vehicles rear storage compartment tucked above the wheelwell It feels sturdy as if it was made with good materials and I can say that it will survive many a camping trip in the future This shovel is not meant to dig foxholes or trenches it just wasnt built with that in mind It was meant for simple to moderate tasks and if I could improve on one thing that isnt the folding it would be to add a pick to it as it could then be used to help drive stakes for tents Otherwise it is a good buy compare its cost to the big box retailers 
I wanted to dig a small hole for less than 10 dollars This shovel enabled me to dig a small hole for less than 10 dollars If you would like to dig a small hole for less than 10 dollars then you should buy this shovel 
Very cumbersome to set up By the way Im an avid hikerbackpacker and have set up multiple tents in various types and severity of weather This thing was handsdown the most difficult for me to deal with by myself It did stand up well to wind gusts of 15mph for about an hour but once the heavy rains came it was time to pack up and move off of the beach I would say this is perfect for a light shelter on nice beach days it allows for a bit of shade with some protection from a lightshort rain I also like that it has a big window to allow for a nice breeze to flow through when its really hot It was just large enough to set up a couple of small beach chairs and beach gear for 2 
Packs up small and light enough Can fit 34 adults in the shade albeit close to each other Just a good quick shelter 
got it as a gift for my friend still use it when we get together love the set great game 
These are standard Bocce balls Arrived on time The box was a little beaten up but no damage to product The bag is a little poorly constructed 
Nice Bocce set The balls are durable colors are bright Instructions are included telling how to play the game The case is handy to keep everything together and transport to the playing venue A game anyone can playyoung or old I can see why it is so popular in Italy 
This set is what it appears to be  a high quality well made bocce ball set Well worth the price I paid   40 Since this item often sells for far more worth keeping in mind that it sometimes goes on sale around the holidays 
This game is well constructed with quality materials except the travel bag The clear top panel was literally shredded upon arrival but the bag still works well to hold the balls This is a quality set that will be fun for any backyard or beach Play heed here though these balls are made of a durable resin but if intentionally smashed against each other they could break I think that would take an intentional effort and do not see them cracking or splitting during normal use These are much better quality the what you will find on average 
This is a great set of Bocce balls We took this to the beach and had a blast with it I really like the different colors we split up the teams since there are 4 different colors I was very happy to see that and the carrying case is very nice 
I would not get this again It takes way too long to assemble in the hot sun on the hot sand My husband and I looked like booby the fool putting this thing together at the beach this summer If we had been video taped it would have been a horribly embarrassing youtube video Our poor kids were baking in the sun as we fuddled and fiddled with this thing We finally got it up after what I said was about 1520 minutes My husband believes it took us an hour It felt like an hour but I do believe it was more like 20 minutes All the while everyone around us had gotten the memo to just get and umbrella beach shade that you lean into the sand That is what Ill be getting for 2014 
The locking collar broke and the handle qould not stay up 
Very strong and light weight Collapses well so as to fit in the spare tire wheel well to be used in case of emergency Also very handy for around the yard planting bushes complimenting the long handled shovel prep 
Giving 4 stars because i havent used it yet Bought it for my bug out stuff hope I never have to use it but it is very well built 
I bought a coleman folding shovel in the early 90s and a buddy of mine just bought one a few weeks ago Im sorry but if you have any complaints about this shovel you got a knock off I have beaten misused and tried to destroy my shovel in the 90s Ive taken it on construction jobs helped a buddy dig a trench around his foundation  taken it camping Still folded still was strong was never flexable was made very well And still is Thats right people I still have mine My buddy is beating the crap out of his right now Still seems to be holding up just like mine Again if you have any complaints about coleman folding shovels you got ripped off with a knock off 
I read lots of reviews and searched for a good price and this was what I came down to and so far its working great It has held up to a summer of light use We have lawn with few rocks They are real not kid weighted or plastic I am sure the professional sets are better but I need more than one activity for the money I would recommend this 
Good looking and great for our guests High quality with great color and finish Good instructions and nice carrying case 
We used this all summer quite a bit We did not have any breaking issues that I have seen in some reviews from other sets from this company Took a lot of knocks against each other Very good game and lots of fun 
Great Item 
great camping accessory 
my grandson loves the shovel its big enough for him to dig a hole he wants 
Works well while out camping folds and takes little space Very sturdy 
Poorly made shovel The locking collar ring bendscrushes as soon as any pressure from the shovel blade is applied I had to buy a 15 heavy galvanized washer from home depot and dremmel open the center to replace the crushed collar ring Just Remove the shovel blade and slip on the New collar endring After that it worked fine Too bad coleman didnt spend the extra 20 cents to make the shovel more durable If you can fabricate the collar ring yourself then its a good value and performed as good as the military Ames ones 
You are in for a treat with this unit First let me say Killer good job giving us a bad that actually fits everything back into it THANK YOU As for set up and break down not an issue once you practice it a few times I did it alone several times and with another which is helpful in the wind The trick is to fist anchor the edges with sand Then install all the poles and lift into place This way the wind does not blow under the tent making it difficult It is a nice large space with really great sun coverage We used it on Block Island for week and In NC for another week every day packing in and packing out YOu can fit two chairs inside and seat two adults with room for drinks The back screen and door is a great design and the flexibility of how much to open and close really matters on bright or windy days You will be pleased with this unit if you are comfortable with setting up tents or willing to at least do a few dry runs in your back yard first It is worth it when you are out there on the beach to be ready to set up fast 
These hard round balls are of exquisite quality The package holds them in place and they are very smooth Recommend 
I recently moved into a house with a large back yard so we looked into getting some lawn games This is a great bocce set The balls are very heavy and smooth and seem to be pretty durable They have smashed into each other in several of our games and still have no marks or scratches The measuring device leaves a bit to be desired it is too small to fit over the pallino which makes measuring difficult However for the casual backyard game it isnt difficult to improvise The case works well too after approximately 10 games taking the balls in and out its holding up fine 
This was another gift for my niece and her husband They go camping a lot and requested this item They said it works great is good quality and exactly what they needed 
Have used it to dig fire pits and latrine holes Is holding up fairly well  The real test will be a foxhole 
put away in my emergency stash just in case of storms earthquakes end of the world or what ever comes my way 
This thing is garbage and broke REALLY fast Dont buy this youll want to punch yourself in the throat for wasting the money I would have been better off with a plastic kids sand shovel What broke The twistlock contraption that allows the shovel to fold and then extend into a locked position is weakly constructed After like three or four scoops it broke and now i have a limp shovel incapable of locking into position 
For ten dollars these are a good camp shovel Strong construction and take a good bit of abuse For the price I cant really think of anything negative about these tools Recommend 
The balls are top quality We play extreme bocce most of the time and these balls have the performance you need The way they drop will knock your teeth out Trust me 
heavy duty metal easy to use and compact say no more Nudge  Nudge Better than eating crunchy frog well almost 
I like how compact this shovel is yet it is very strong when used It opens and folds very easy 
Keeping this shovel in an SUV in case I need it seems to be tougher metal then most of the folding shovels I have encountered that cost less I have not put it through its paces in order to find out however 
Bought this from a local retailer not off of amazon Used it to dig maybe a 1ft deep hole By the time I was done the nut used to lock the shovel in place was bent rendering the shovel useless If your looking for a disposable folding shovel go for it 
The fat metal part you see in the picture on the shaft  yeah that one its not big enough So when you slide it all the way up  your shovel is going to close anyway on your first dig It could be used to move ashes around in a fire pit thats about it I returned in within 15 minutes of opening the box Buy yourself a stand US Military Issue ETool if you need to do more than build sandcastles with your shovel The price is right so some of you will buy one anyway I did lol But look for yourself when you do extend the shovel spin the clamp up the shaft until its very tight and then grab the shovel and bend it it will bend right back into its folding position after defeating the little clamp It needs a solid metal ORing  Washer above the clamp or bigger arms on the shovel A waste of time 
This shade works great The only reason I didnt give five stars is because it did take two of us to set this up We use it as a sunwind shade on the beach and with only one person we never would have gotten it set up with any wind blowing 
I am no avid Bocce ball player I was just looking for a fun field game to play with friends The balls have held up well and come in a very convenient carrying case I usually keep them in my car trunk just in case I find myself looking for an activity to do 
I kind of figured you couldnt go wrong with the Coleman name since I recall the brand fondly from years ago Well I was wrong Coleman should be ashamed to put their name on this Chinese POS It folded like it made from tin the first time I tried to use it The only positive thing I can say about it is I didnt feel too bad when I tossed it in the trash Even if it was free and you only had to pay for shipping Well it isnt worth even the price of shipping 
I was looking for a folding shovel to include in a Roadside Emergency Kit for the trunk of my family car I made the decision to buy this shovel in spite of the negative reviews since I have never bought a Coleman product in the past that I was truly dissatisfied with Well as they say there is a first time for everything This shovel is made in Taiwan and it lives up to everything you have ever heard about products from that region of the world At first glance the shovel looks and feels like it is quality that is until you actually begin to use it I was shocked when I opened the shovel for the first time and screwed the locked up against the shovel as tightly as I could without the help of a wrench and even double and triple checked the lock to make sure it was seated correctly etc and then holding the shovel in my hands I attempted to override the lock and pull the shovel toward me out of the full open position into the hoe or chopping position and I was surprised at how easily the shovel just folded over with very little effort on my part I am 66 years old and have arthritis in both hands so that should give you some idea of how easily it folded I also noticed that the three sections of the shovel wiggle at least 14 back and forth even when securely locked open I have not attempted to actually dig with the shovel since I am afraid that doing so will cause the three sections to fold up during use and I could end up with injuries TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED RETURNING THE PRODUCT FOR REFUND DO NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL ESPECIALLY FOR USE IN AN EMERGENCY The last thing I need is to be injured by a tool I bought to help me get out of a lifethreatening emergency The irony of that possibility is more than I am willing to deal with 
What a wonderful bocce ball set The quality and price of this items was fantastic I like that you can have up to 8 players with the multicolors vs a two color set I plan on taking this to a family reunion and cant wait to use it After reviewing several other option Im glad I chose this one 
I just moved to a house less then 1 mile from the Ocean My kids are 10  11 and have gills When we go to the beach we are there for the day I also have sun Umbrellas but this shelter is much easier to use The wind really has no effect and the size and weight are amazing I can set it up in less then 5 minutes in the wind Some people have stated it gets hot when you set it up open the back panel and adjust to the angle of the sun with any wind the heat is not a problem On really hot days down here there is nothing you can do about the heat that is why you are at the beach Be careful with the poles when you set it up as the quality is not the greatest That is why I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 Enjoy 
Coleman has managed to screw up one of the most ingenious and simple designs ever envisioned by man This shovel aka etool or entrenching tool by the militaryhad been on my hitlist for a while The design is so simple theres not a lot that CAN possibly go wrong Enter the Coleman folding camp shovel For its maiden mission I headed out to the remove a wellrooted shrub from a grave headstone Not a huge job PITIFUL craftsmanship with this shovelbent up horribly from light digging work Buy a surplus etool instead Thats the same EXACT thing only milspec quality construction Shame on you Coleman for putting your name on this piece of garbage 
I hiked about 10 miles with this shovel I use it to work on the trail in a place it had been washed out It was not too heavy and did not break when being used This was the first folding shovel I have owned so I dont have much to compare it too Also the first time I have taken a shovel with me hiking but this trail was really in bad shape and had a 100 foot drop on the side 
I actually just bought this exact item today while I was at Wal Mart for 100 cheaper Being a veteran its no military issue ETool but for my 8 year old it will work great Were going to give it to him with some other stuff for Christmas and it seems to be sturdy enough and Im sure hell love it 
This set is awesome we have had many a night filled with using this set It is strong and durable holding up to hard hits Compared to other sets this is the papa We had to use two sets to accomodate a large crowd the other set was smaller much lighter and just bounced around the yard I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good time 
I played bocce at the beach for the first time a couple of months ago and I was hooked I went home and immediately did hours of research to find the best one for the price This set won out in the end So I played with this one and another Sportcraft 100 mm black  red one and the quality was there for both of them but I am satisfied that I ordered this set because of the 4 colors and the slightly larger 109mm size Let me be brief  Pros 1 high quality material 2 weighted really nicely nice size too 3 4 colors then each 2 bocce balls of the same color are differentiated by different markings making it possible for up to 8 different people to play I have needed 8 balls a couple of times so this alone has made this set worth it 4 Great pallino and measuring device Cons 1 cheap bag Ive seen better from cheaper sets at the store The bag will not likely outlast the set 2 Paint wear pretty quickly Pro who cares It adds character I enjoyed my set so much after the first few uses that I ordered one from Amazon for my fathers birthday He loves it and he will be able to play it with his grandkids which shows the versatility of this game Bonus tip Free trial of Amazon prime got it to me next day with just a few bucks more Well worth it UPDATE I have now owned this set for almost five years This is a product that has been so good I felt obligated to revise my review This set has seen countless games on the beaches of Florida to the mountains of Colorado to the sand dunes in Southern Utah Bocce has become easily my most favorite outdoor game My wife just commented today you have made a lot of friends with that game Its true its a great game because people dont need experience to play or have fun Anybody can just join in and get the hang of it I have only owned this one set and it has held up beautifully The balls now all have character with the paint being severely dulled and worn but it doesnt affect gameplay at all Just as predicted the bag is about dead but just refuses to bust open It is ripping at the seams Im not sure what Ill do when the bag breaks Maybe I can have the company send me a new one The balls have no chips or cracks after many hard hits on rocks concrete and against each other so I expect them to continue to last I have played with 3 other sets not sure the manufactueres This one felt like the best size and weight for my throw and the materials feel better than most Bottom line the game of Bocce is tons of fun and this set is the best Ive played with I have had many times where more than four people want to play Usually it is more than four but less than eight This is tricky because then each person would really only have one ball to throw Although that is still fun part of the skill of the game is to throw your first ball and then adjust for the second so that you get better If you only throw one ball it takes away that aspect So I am going to get a second set so that everyone can throw at least two balls 
My husband and I used this at Old Orchard beach and we were thrilled with how easy it is to set up We fell asleep and neither of us burned Thank you This has also been used by my daughter and she loved it as well Plenty of room 
My husband uses this so he can spend a day at the beach without burning Its fairly easy to assemble and we love that you can zip it closed if you need a space to change 2 adults can comfortably sit in its shade without their heads touching the top 
I saw an online video of this folding shovel being used by an army soldier It was very useful as many things even as a weapon The video prompted me to buy one though no a Coleman brand It really helped me during the last 3 camping trips I used it to clear some bushes even up the gravel before I pitch the tent It helped set the charcoals for BBQ and helped remove the ashes after the BBQ It helped dug several holes for different purposes It is very easy to store away in the camping gear box It is very inexpensive to own and very durable in use It is light weight and very sturdy If you do camping once or twice per year it is definitely something worthwhile to add to your gear set Highly recommended 
This little folding shovel is worth its weight in gold I use it on treasure hunt digs and it fits nicely in my backpack Campers woodsmen hikers and treasure hunters will appreciate the quality sturdiness and easeofcarry this shovel provides I didnt find the specs but I am sure this shovel meets military specs Coleman is synonymous with quality and value in outdoors products Amazon made it a breeze to order and own I recommend it 
used this shovel on my last camping trip had to dig a trench to divert rain water away from my tent the handle bent on the second dig 
This Coleman Folding Shovel is OK for the primary purpose I bought for as an emergency shovel to keep in my car for removing snow or dirt if I get stuck It would likely be a bit disappointing and inadequate as a camping shovel Here are my observations Pros   Small Size as advertised this does fold into a very manageable size  Versatile the head can be positioned as a shovel or hoe Cons   Saw the two saw areas along the shovel blade are not at all sharp or saw like at all  Shaky even when fully extended and tightened there is a good bit of play in the movable parts Misc   No case or cover comes with it While not an outstanding piece of survival gear it still has a place in my trunk but I will likely look for another brand for my other cars CFH 
The steel ring where the shaft contacts the back of the shovel head isnt hardened The shovel basically ripped itself apart the first time I used it to dig a hole in not very hard soil Good thing it wasnt an emergency I expected at least ok quality from Coleman it seems they really let there quality hit rock bottom Looks like I have a new door stop and will be looking for a new camp shovel Unless you are looking to scooping a litter box dont waste yer money on this garbage 
I purchased this bocce set for our summer trip last year We use it in the back yard and take it along on picnics Balls are sturdy and the carrying case is good enough to hold them Instructions are included but we play by our own rules Its mostly a socialdrink beer and toss the ball game for us Its very compact and easy to store but it is heavy Im pleased with the purchase 
I planned a summer party this year and thought it might be fun to try playing Bocce I had never played before but I didnt want to get a cheap set or a starter set I wanted the real thing I bought this set and it looks great Good weight and the case is sturdy I brought it out during the party and it was used the entire rest of the day in the yard Since then my friends and I have played several more times and the set is holding up just fine There are a few tiny scratches on some of them but thats just normal wear and tear Accidentally hitting the bricks lining the trees in my yard probably doesnt help but they took the hit just fine This is a really nice set for a good price I would very much recommend them 
I bought this set for my fatherinlaw and got a chance to play over the July 4th weekend The balls have a good heft to them not light like some others Ive used and the bag is fine I think another reviewer stated there were no instructions At least in this shipment there was a singlesided 85x11 page of instructions at the top of the bag Because they are made of resin I noticed some marks and scratches on the balls before the first round was even over but they didnt affect gameplay roll bounce etc One minor gripe is that the set has four colors instead of two but thats easily overlooked when having a blast playing bocce with friends and family Im going to order a set for myself once Im done with this review I want to use these on grass the beach anywhere 
Like all Star Brite products this works great Got the bilges on our yacht spotless with no effort and they smell nice too I have tried other products with mixed success at the cleaning but all left an oilydamp smell This product cleaned up even the smell 
I am very happy with this Chinese quality They are as everyone else has said very nice and weighted Very heavy think it was 22 pounds with shipping Free shipping made it possible They are very nice and the tote box is well designed These should last several generations of family use 
I have been using Orange Bilge Cleaner for decades and this Star Brite does a really nice job I have an 18 foot Classic Donzi and it sprang an oil leak right at the oil leak detector device So I wound up with some oil in my bilge Thank goodness I noticed it in time Anyhow regular soaps dont seem to cut it for really getting out the grease This orange bilge cleaner not only gets out the oil with a minimum of scrubbing in the areas that are accessible and can be seen it also passively helps to reduce the amounts that get into the nonvisible areas under the deck The real thing is the citrus orange smell Makes you want to use it even when the bilge is already clean A little bit goes a long way Highly recommended 
Im using this as a general purpose greasy parts cleaner in my workshop and it is great for that 
This orange cleaner does a good job of cleaning greasy grime as well as organic matter and leaves a pleasant orange fragrance It is very similar or identical to other products from the same brand that are labelled for other uses as well as other brands of orange cleaners on the market It is available in larger sizes so definitely shop around for the best value Be careful not to allow this or other marine cleaners to pollute the water 
This arrived just in time to try on my Jeeps oil pan The Jeep needed a new oil pan gasket so I thought Id use this opportunity to test out the Super Orange Citrus Bilge Cleaner And It worked like a champ Super Orange destroyed the goop that was lounging around in the bottom of my Jeeps engine and made the oil pan look shiny and new Definitely does the job 
I got this product for free through vine and did not expect much I decided I would try it on this oil stain ive had in my garage for quite some time It doesnt even look like a stain anymore just a discoloration in the concrete My wife was pissed when I made the oil spill so I remember cleaning it with standard Dawn soap but it didnt help much I scrubbed with this stuffand in my opinion it didnt do much better It does smell really good though And my wife thinks it looks better so I guess thats all that counts 
This is an updated review of the product as of 06132017 The boat I most recently used this on is a 2007 Correct Craft 22 Super Air Nautigue My boat typically is clean as I spray the hold on a normal wash There are extra brass fittings in the boat for water shutoffs for ballast tanks so it is a busy area I only use this boat in fresh water With that said I used the recommended mix poured the solution into the hold and let it sit for 30 minutes I was not comfortable opening the bilge out for the entire pumpout because of the environment in where the trailer was parked so after allthree bilge pumps were in fact pumping for 5 minutes I shut the pumps off I did notice the same color coming from the outlets from the sides of the boat so I figured it cleaned the hoses and pumps After visual inspection in the hold there was no visual residue or leftover product on the fittings but I did still wash over the affected area with a garden hose This is a nice product I will share information with fellow boat enthusiasts about the product and my findings 
Were new to boating but I have been happy to try out a whole series of Star brite cleaners and liquids This one does just what it says it does and we have been able to use it on fiberglass metal and plastic The fresh orange scent is a relief and a pleasure too Citrus extract formula emulsifies oil grease fuel and transmission fluid Powerful yet biodegradable formula Will not harm fiberglass metal plastic Leaves a fresh citrus smell in bilge 
One bottle does a boat up to a 25 foot boat If the bilge is dry you need to add some water  I used a 5 gallon bucket and added this to the bucket then dumped in Cleaning out the bilge is the biggest pain  you obviously dont want to just pump the waste into the lake I used a wetvac Did a great job cleaning and left the bilge smelling like a fruit stand BTW Ive also used this in my ejection pump well at home  occasionally the pump gets jammed or the float switch breaks I dump in about 13rd of a bottle in the sump and let it sit a while then pull the pump Cuts down on the grime and stink 
This seems to be a good cleaner with good suds and a nice pleasant scent There is a warning on the bottle that ingredients have caused cancer in California so that is a bit ominous I used rubber gloves and tried to avoid contact with it as I was using it It did a great job worked super well as a degreaser and left a terrific citrus scent 
does a good job as a degreaser on some engines I was cleaning considering its environmentally friendllyhard to knock it i have used better but of course with harsh chemicals since I am chemically sensitive I try to use products with less harsh chemicals 
This Star brite orange citrus bilge cleaner is very potent and simple to use It does have a pleasant scent and it will not harm the metal plastic or fiberglass parts of the bilge As with any emulsifier cleaner precautions must be taken by wearing protective gloves and boots while using this product Other than that I recommend it as well as many of the Star brite cleaners which make our busy lives much more easy 
This worked out fine in our boat We followed the instructions on the bottle and did not have any problems Smells very much like citrus and clean 
Nice safe for material cleaner with a pleasant citrus smell Used on some goopified plumbingdrainage components myself with success Although it is described as biodegradable theres one of those needlessly scary state of California warnings on it  After reading the ingredients I see no reason to that be fearful of it Did NOT get on myself so cant speak to its irritant or caustic properties on skin however I recommend in general not making direct skin contact with emulsifierscleaners which are designed to break down grease fuel oil goop etc Manufacturer has other cleaning type products which also look promising 
Im not exactly sure what a bilge cleaner is other than its for a boat I do see that this thing is made in the USA I mistakenly thought it was a general all purpose cleaner but it is not 
I used this on my boat It smells great but it suds a lot Major suds Not sure it does much cleaning but it sure smells great 
This is a very effective product for grease and oils It cleaned the bilge in my boat faster and better than other products I have tried before It is also very easy to use Just let it slosh around while using the boat and then drain it when you return to the dock 
Love this stuff Works in tough motor oil and grease stains in the shop towels we pour a bit into 5 gallon bucket with hot water and soak them over night Then rise and toss into washing machine We have also used on the garage floor with the power washer 
Amazing product cleaned the bilge better than anything I have used before Letting it sit in the bilge mixed with water while running the boat required disabling the bilge pump but not a big deal After using the boat for a day with this Star Brite cleaner I drained and flushed the bilge and it looks really good I never imagined that it would be that easy to clean the bilge on the boat really great product 
The Star bright Super orange cleaner works amazingly one product that does many different jobs such a emulsifies oil grease transmission fluid fuel scum and sludge will harm fiberglass rubber hoses wiring metal or plastic and it is also sea safe for us it is lake safe The smell is like walking in a orchard of orange It does not require much scrubbing Yeah for that For a clean boat ski jets this is way to go to always have that like new look 
Works well 
Once assembled the tent is great But the poles are very cheap feeling and get caught on the pole sleeves and poked a hole through it Now its a pain to put together again I would have expected something better from Coleman 
Worked great at the beach and it was a windy day Cant wait till next summer The only Down fall is the mesh that the tent poles have to go through It the poles catch on the mesh and is kind of a pain 
We used this all summer Our son turned 1 at the start of the summer and we spend a lot of time at the shore we wanted something more than an umbrella and this was excellent choice 
I got this at the last minute after reading the reviews they had me worried but this tent was easy to setup and held up great in a alot of wind at the beach I goes up like your standard modern tent that use the corded bow rods comes with everythind you need its not a big tent but enough room for about 3 average size peoplemy wife didnt like it cause she felt isolated from the rest of the group so she sat with them under the eazy up tentjust take your time feeding the poles though the netting 
We bought this to use at the beach when we had an infant Now we use it for the whole family to get some much needed shade between sand castle building Takes about 5 minutes to set up Mark sure your beach allows tents like this Some dont allow anything with a floor like this one 
I used this beach shadetent for 30 days on a European beach vacation The nonmetallic tent poles made it through security without a hitch As for the tent it worked great The included sandbags hold the tent down even in high winds I would say that the floor needs to be some kind of mesh though because it holds sand like a bucket Very hard to get it all out 
I bought this tent and was extremely happy I needed a good tent for the beach for my 6 month old and it was great Plenty of room for my wife 6 month old and my 5 year old Easy to set up and take down I read a few people complained about not being able to get it back in the bag I never had an issue 
I purchased this for our beach vacation upon arrival I put it together inside and assembly was easy It becomes slightly more difficult with wind at the beach but the tent is well made and makes a great sun shelter and even light rain shelter I understand the concern about the mesh that holds the poles but I have not had an issue with it Its difficult to push the poles through fast because the connectors catch on the fabric thus you have to feed them through slowly anyway making it easy to be careful not to thrust it through the fabric All 3 fiberglass pole pieces feed through these very long mesh loops I like the mesh better than a solid loops because it allows sand and water to pass through instead of sitting inside causing damage Overall its a great tent and you just have to treat it well 
Great product and quality I like so much It is a good product and good price I would buy again Thank you 
Was so glad to find a more affordable option compared to the Kelty As we live 15 hours or more from the closest saltwater beach when we go we stay all day After setting this up folks who were leaving stated that if they had a shelter like us they wouldnt be leaving The temp was in the high 90s with nary a cloud in sight A great day to test out our shelter Prior to purchasing this we used two beach umbrellas and would need to move with the shade all day  but if youre on a real crowded beach and your neighbors are real close you have to move your umbrellas all day Either way its annoying inconvenient and can be downright dangerous if youve fallen asleep This eliminates almost all of that I say almost as we still needed an umbrella in front until later in the afternoon when the sun was mostly behind us We enjoyed the partial privacy afforded by blocking our view of our side neighbors It was very nice to take a nap and not worry about the sun moving OR feeling as though youre on display while you sleep We only used stakes around the edges of the shelter we didnt feel we would need tieout lines At times the wind was extremely gusty and although we didnt use the tieout lines the shelter didnt go anywhere  many beach umbrellas became projectiles and our own umbrella turned inside out  so the wind was very strong We also liked having items in the shelter that were kept sandfree It was nice to have everything contained within the shelter And if youre like us and like to go for long walks its nice to know that your stuff isnt exposed to everyone and the sea gulls We had the back window open and rolled up for ventilation until the sun moved back there Then we unhooked it and let it hang so wed be shaded but still have ventilation We are more than pleased with this shelter Its easy to set up roomy stays put in gusty winds is easy to take down and doesnt weigh much We are looking forward to our next beach day 
WOW THIS IS THE BEST LITTLE BEACH shade I have ever seen or used I love the cross ventilation air flow It sets up in less than 10 minuteswith practice it sets up in 5 minutes or less This really provides the proper shade and privacy and feel of a personal cabana Many have asked me where I got it I said Amazon The little common tents dont have the ventilation and large overhead shade It will not blow away since it comes with stakes The color is nice I am so HAPPY with this purchase 
This item is really a tent with an open side so you need to be prepared to put it up like a tent Cons It takes two people to assemble You have to stake it or its fairly easy to knock over with a breeze I dont see how this is possible with the stakes that are provided How do you drive a thin wire like stake into the sand The paths for the rods are made of mesh They tore in several places when feeding the rods through and also when removing them Removing the rods through the mesh paths was very frustrating Pros  Price  Has a floor  Compact when packed  Light weight  Roomy 
Were currently in Oscoda MI on the beaches of Lake Huron The tent took about 5 minutes but the instructions are easy to follow and its quite simple to erect Thoughtful design with the extra pockets inside and the line for hanging wet items to dry We love it and its ideal for our purposes 
Coleman did a great job with this one We can bring this anywhere and the kids love it Pretty easy to put together It folds up pretty small and has the instructions sewn right in the carrying case No fussing with finding the right poles to put together 
small and simple to assembly carrying bag too small it should have been larger and wider also the sticks should have been bigger but overall it is a great tent 
Great tent especially if you have an infant or crawling child I usually put this tent up by myself in about 10 min while my wife watches the kids We have used it for the past five summers sparingly It is holding up just fine It is very light weight and easy to carry to beach Would buy is again and recommend to others although we went to Myrtle Beach and they have outlawed all tent type beach shelters They made us take it down 
This beach shade offers protection at the beach When I am in Naples Fl I hit the beach every day with my dog and sometimes my husband This shade assembles quickly with three poles I can do this fairly well solo but having my husband around literally makes it a snap It comes with bags that when added with sand anchor the shade securely since this does not have stakes It has a opening at the back which allows for ventilation on hot days It also can be zipped up if you want to use this as a changing room though I havent used it for that purpose Overall this shades quality is pretty good and its ease of assembly recommends it as an alternative to a spring loaded shade or tent Ive had this for over a year and this still looks new While this is on the small side its portability and price recommend it and it offers protection from the direct sun especially if you combo it up with a couple of portable beach umbrellas I like this shade and my dog loves it 
We live in NJ and took this tent to the Nude beach at Sandy hook The beach is Gunnison Beach it is very windy beach a the end of Sandy Hook  looking up NY harbor The tent held up perfect It packs up tight and is small enough that we brought it on our Motorcycle The Trick is you MUST set this up before you go to your favorite spot its a little tricky but Coleman is smart there directions are sewn on the bag  comes with Sand bags We used these what we did was burry the sand bag and realy gave the tent stability 
If you have little ones you cant stay a the beach for long periods of time anyways Im and Eagle Scout and couldnt set this up in less than 10 minutes if there was any breeze on the beach We missed the return window ordering this weeks before the beach trip and it just went in the trash can when we got home Would not recommend get a nice umbrella you can stick in the ground in 30 seconds and enjoy your time at the beach instead 
easy to put it up easy to take down really big inside 1 adult not super tall guys can sleep in there comfortably with a dog The door closes to make a quick changing room floor is the same material as the rest of the shade so im afraid it might wear out quick specially if i use chairs inside 
Great holster but like everyone says it will take some getting used to and making adjustments for a few wks until you get it adjusted to your body just right As for quality there is no question there thats its real good Look forward to carrying my P227 in this holster for the rest of my time here 
good 
great 
It was delivered quickly a little hard to set up took me about 30 min the first time by myself in the back yard It seems built to last  I fear how hard it will be to set up with the winds of the beach  and I dont know how they expect you to make it fit in the bag it came out of this never works for me 
HUGE So much bigger than it looks in picture Great Shade and easy set up Ventilation was not a problem for me I wasnt expecting it to zip up into a changing room that is a plus 
sturdy and comes with sandbags withstood high wind at beach  the zippers are easy to use the only downside is the putting the rods thru a mesh i can see this getting ripped but for 40 dollarsnot a bad deal 
Good at beach with no wind took to Destin FL on family vacationtoo much wind for the skinny anchors you need to buy anchors that are made for sand The ones that it came with are for dirt Other than that good product 
we really loved this product had issues with bugs hassling us at the beach because we were in the shade but that doesnt have anything to do with the product itself it was great 
The Coleman Road Trip Beach Shade saved our trip to the beach Went to barrier islands of SC second week of March It was cold and windy The beach shade angled just right protected us from the chilly breeze It stood up against strong wind gusts and stayed firmly anchored Of course it protected us from the sun as well I am very pleased with the Coleman Beach Shade 
I was hesitant to purchase this based upon some of the complaints but having assembled this today in the house I do not foresee any quality problems or other issues and expect this tent will last for years to come Assembly is just like a normal tent with fiberglass rods that assemble into a longer pole There are three poles each about 6 to 8 feet long assembled The poles slide into mesh sleeves which are less durable than nylon fabric but prevent sand from filling the sleeves Just take your time during tent assembly and disassembly do not force the rods and the mesh should not be a problem As for the tent itself it is quite large easily fitting two adults possible three In the back is a doorwindow with a solid panel and screen depending upon which zipper you open there are two on the back door one for the nylon flap one for the screen The large front door also zips shut for privacychanging clothes The carry case is also nice and well made with handles to carry everything in a compact form This tent is a really great item and I will update this review should there be any issues which I do not foresee given the nice quality of this tent The tent is made in Bangladesh UPDATE MAY 5 2013 We took this to the beach where the conditions were windy Set up required two adults to fight against the wind Total set up time must have been 10 minutes however once set up it provided shelter from the wind and sun We stayed all day at the beach until almost sunset and without the tent the wind and sun would have forced us to leave much sooner Some strong gusts did occasionally push the tent sides in a bit but they popped back out as the wind subsided On windy days I would not leave the tent without a person inside to prevent it blowing away The included sand bags which we used would not have prevented the tent from blowing away Taking the tent down was much easier taking about 2 minutes My review above still stands but I wanted to update with how it performs on a windy day 
Bought this last year for some shade from the hot beach sun Relatively lightweight and easy to put together it just takes some time especially if its windy Although I would have rated it higher for quicker setup there are several poles that ingeniously fit together yet are able to be broken down so they fit in the bag With longer poles it would be harder to carry around Wish I could give it 45 stars BTW If you leave the back zipped closed and the wind is blowing you better anchor it securely or you could be in for a ride Additionally sometimes bugs and flies will get trapped We usually leave it open for crossflow Does the job by keeping us protected from the sun 
I have nothing but good things to say Easy to put up and take down Holds up very well against wind and sturdy enough to last a long time One con I have is the rod guides are made of a web type cloth so when you put it up or take it down it snags in the cloth and makes it more difficult to assemble the tent If the guides were made of a smooth cloth then it would be a lot easier to assemble the tent 
Works fine makes filling my stove cleaner and no brainer I recommend it 
This product is very simple to use Just put it in the tank of your Coleman liquid fuel product and press down on the spout Wait for it to stop gurgling and then your tank is full It would be difficult to use if you were also using a filtering funnel since you need to press down on the spout for fuel to come out I would suggest you dont use this product in conjunction with a filter funnel 
Works well with Coleman stove better than the free one they included 
Works fantastic 
GOOD 
Works as advertised 
Have used these for years and will never go back to using a funnel Almost drip proof and unspillable  but do release the pressure in hot weather before filling A lot cheaper online Good product 
This is a musthave item if you use Coleman fuel for your gas stoves and lantern I dont know why I waited so long to get one You replace the white cap on the fuel can standard 1 diameter by putting this threaded filler device in place of the cap Put the nozzle into the fuel canister of your stove or lantern and push down which releases the liquid fuel from the fuel can into your stove or lantern You can hear the fuel going into the stove or lantern glug glug glug When the sound stops it is full You just life the filler assembly out of the stovelantern and you are done The stovelantern will be filled to the exact correct level and not overfilled If you have ever filled a Coleman liquid fuel stove or lantern using a funnel or directly filling it without a funnel then you know that overfilling or underfilling and spilling is very common and difficult to avoid This device solves the fill level and spilling problems when filling Coleman liquid fuel stoves and lanterns 
I bought one of these 30 years ago and it finally quit this summer orings dry rotted I havent unpacked the new one yet but it looks to be exactly the same Probably good for another 30 years now

I bought this so I could reduce spilling Coleman fuel all over myself when camping While it can do the job well I found that the spring was a bit cumbersome when youre trying to pour and hold it down so that the fuel will come out Definitely takes both hands and requires some strength in your fingers to be able to hold that valve open 
GREAT WILL RECOMMEND n REPURCHASE 
I like the conceptdispensing fuel directly from the cumbersome Coleman cans directly into the appliance and an automatic shutoff when the tank is full Unfortunately the one I purchased years ago leaked from day 1 It got to the point that the amount of fuel I spilledlost while using this was the same as the fuel I spilled when pouring directly from the can into a funnel Pros  Pour directly from those ridiculously difficulttouse Coleman fuel cans  Leave it installed on the can all the time  Fit directly into the spout of Coleman appliances  Automatically stops flowing when the appliance fuel tank is full Cons  Mine leaked quite a bit even from new Perhaps I got a defective unit Consider finding a way to keep the internal gasketsorings lubricated Maybe that would cut down on leakage  With the weight of full fuel can its easy to torque the twopiece design which causes fuel to leak at the internal seal  I still lost a bit of fuel while filling appliance much less than pouring directly from a can but enough to be annoying nonetheless  No filter as far as I can tell Thats not a problem if Im using brand new fresh fuel but if Im using older fuel which could have contaminants or gelled globs I could end up with a clogged appliance I think Ill try purchasing another one to see if its better than the first leaky one I used Edit I purchased a second one and I dont currently have any problems with leaking 1 star added 
Love these things They make it super convenient to fill Coleman products When I go on trips where I do not want to bring a gallon of fuel I usually bring a glass soda bottle with a twist off cap and screw this thing on it You can also use this to fill the glass bottle I have left it on bottles and cans for months with no leaks Do be aware that after about 23 years the internal Orings will dry rot and you will have to buy a new one They couldnt make it perfect if they did you wouldnt need to buy a new one I have went thru about six of these now but I keep buying them because they are so convenient 
WORKS GOOD IF YOU ALWAYS OVER FILL THE OLD WAY LIKE I DID 
Sturdy solid little piece of equipment Easily prevents overflow Well worth the cost 
Works as expected 
weve used this at the beach and park on hot and windy days and its been great it vents well and doesnt get too hot inside weve also been in very strong winds and with the sandbags that come with it it stood up to the wind well and was wonderful in keeping us shielded from the flying sand and cold it was a really cold windy day at the beach but we love that one bit of advice when dealing with the wind is obviously to put whatever weight you have inside like a cooler but also push sand up on the outside edges to seal any space so that the wind doesnt come up underneath and push it up 
This is what I think you should use to fill your lantern or stove instead of a funnel Just a neater  safer way of doing it in my opinion 
I bought this by accident from an Amazon recommended thinking it was one thing when it was another As we were packing up for our camping trip my husband saw it and was ecstatic Now he could pour fuel out the can without spilling or dripping it everywhere  Um yes That is exactly why I bought it And this spout does just that You screw it onto the can and put the nozzle right into the fuel container As you push the fuel can down it releases the fuel and when you pull up the can up it stops Tip it over the gas can and it doesnt spill No mess 
very pleased 
This is cool Wished it came standard with other Coleman gas products 
Works as intended truly aids in spill prevention 
very handy item 
Nice 
great filler 
Arrived on time Excellent purchase Operates as advertised 
This sure makes refills less messy and every thing go in to the right place 
Works great for my stove and lanterns 
This works long as you dont wait to long to stop filling the tank since you cant see how much is going into the tank 
You cant leave it on the can it leaks a bitif the can falls over youve got a hazard But it doesnt leak in use so Im okay with that 
What can I say it works well 
Its ok It is little difficult to pull up to open the valve to pour the fuel 
Lost my old one needed a replacement Same spout Functions fine The price was right 
Works as advertized What more do I need to add 
I like it because you do not wast fuel  I talked to my buds about it they like it as well so Thanks  Roger A 
Works good without overflowing and losing fuel I had been using the regular funnel but it was hard to see when full This one stops when full so you dont have to lose fuel in the process 
Makes dispensing boom juice without spilling and overfilling easy Automatically seals when you release pressure means you can leave it on the can between uses 
If you use Coleman fuel for anything then you need this spout which screws easily onto the fuel can and comes off just as easy This makes pouring fuel so much easier and because you are not spilling any you end up saving the money in fuel that you spend on this filler 
Does exactly what it is designed to do What else can one say But gotta meet the stupid word count 
Doesnt fit my older 1940s lantern but that said the item works just as described for other products Just bewareif you have a small inlet may not work for you 
What else is needed to tell It simply does what it says that it does I need a few more words to complete this review That does it 
In theory the would be great a screw on funnel filter cutoff for pouring coleman fuel but screw it on a can screw it down tight and itll still leak around the bottom pass on this and just use a coleman filtering funnel 
This is a great accessorie to any Coleman camping stove or lantern It screws directly onto a gallon can of Coleman fuel and provides a spillfree way to fill up your camping tools My dad has one that is pretty old and though it is starting to crack in places it still works great I won a great Coleman 413 camping stove in an eBay auction and I couldnt resist getting myself one of these fuel fillers Great and timeless product 
If you camp and use liquid fuel you need this  It will save you money with fewer spills  Buy it 
fits great on the gallon of coleman 1 gallon white gas cans  helps not to spill the expensive fuel all over the place  
This is a very clean and convent way to fill my Coleman heater No spills and dispenses the fuel quickly 
I see all these wondrous reviews with a few exceptions and then I try it It leaks everywhere and requires too much pressure to start the flow through the spout Im using a brand new can of Coleman fuel the funnel and seal look normal and Ive made sure to securely tighten the funnel It still leaks like a sieve as soon as I tilt the can Has anyone figured out why some of us are finding it unusable 
This is an excellent product  It comes in extremely handy for filling liguid fuel burning lanterns like Colemans  I also use them for liquid fuel burning camp stoves  I do quite a bit of night pier and surf fishing so I burn quite a bit of fuel  These make the job of refueling 2 lanterns and maybe the stove so much eaiser especially if your in a dim lighted situation  You can tilt the can with no spillage because of the press to fill feature  It also has a very nice feature that allows it to stop filling when the tank is full  You dont have to try and observe have much youre putting in as to prevent a runover  This saves on fuel  spillage and runoff into the enviroment  Its a very simple design with a small form factor Very transportable  and the rubber seals last for years  at least mine have  Ive been very happy with mine and the ones Ive used over the years  the ones which have disapeared in strange and mysterious ways   I highly reccomend the use of these great little gadgets  
I was really excited when I got my beach tent thinking that there is no way this could be hard to set up well let me tell you I was wrong Its a real pain in the you know what to set up esp by yourself First of all it really surprises me that the Coleman company would chose netting material to put the poles through it tears too easily unlike the tent material itself I had an easier time putting together a three person tent which is three times bigger than this beach shade I dont know if its because its an unusual shape or what Anyway once I got it up after much frustration the thing was great I guess in some way the frustration was worth it in the end but not sure I really want to go through that again I might try to give it another try to see if I can get fast at getting the thing assembled but if not well it will be for sale soon 
It is practical gadget helps you to avoid mess when filling gas lanterns It is nothing really special but good to have it and is not overpriced 
This works as advertised Initially I thought it was a wasted purchase when I realized my newnbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefColeman2BurnerDualFuelCompactLiquidFuelStovedpB0009PUPX8refcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTF8Coleman 2 Burner Dual Fuel Compact Liquid Fuel Stoveanbspandnbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefColemanTwoMantleDualFuelLanternwithHardCasedpB0009PURIQrefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTF8Coleman TwoMantle Dual Fuel Lantern with Hard Caseanbspalready came with anbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefColemanFilteringFunneldpB0000AS5QBrefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTF8Coleman Filtering Funnela However this fuel fuller makes the funnels unnecessary It easily attaches securely to the Coleman fuel can Ive only used it twice to fill tanks but it will be coming with us on our next camping trips wereas the funnels will not 
Maybe it arrogance or just being lazy I keep hopping that each time I use this thing it will live up to it reputation and not spill a drop However it never does Leaks at every point that there is a crack not a lot but a definite puddle of fuel Then when you remove it from the lantern or stove splash more fuel comes out Never liked it after the first use but its become a staple joke at our camp as for how much fuel it spills We almost take bets on how much 
This is a must have item if you use a Coleman Duel Fuel camp stove or lantern This makes it so easy to fill the stove and lantern without spilling a drop of your fuel It has a spring mechanism that keeps fuel from flowing until it is depressed This is definitely worth the money We do not camp without it 
Theres not too much to say about this product except that it works perfectly Its very easy to use and there are no fuel spills Fine product 
I bought this filler after reading other online reviews and thinking that the Coleman stove and lamp I ordered at the same time didnt have funnels I now have two funnels and one fuel filler I havent even bothered opening the funnels as this fuel filler is light years ahead in convenience Once you attach the filler to the top of the fuel can you simply invert the can into the receptacle and nothing comes out until your ready to push the fuel filler in While tent camping in 37 degree weather refilling my cooking stove with frozen hands was extremely easy and didnt make me worry about spilling the fuel all over the stove and table The convenience makes it worth every cent 
This device works as designed though Id rather it cost five bucks instead Upside no spillage Downside no filter can be harder to judge fill level by ear since the entire filler hole is covered and the gurgling is muffled 
This is a simple ingenious product that makes filling lanterns effortless You wont spill a drop of fuel in the filling process Screw this fuel filler on the fuel can it works on the small weekender bottles too tip into the lantern or other fuel product press down slightly and it fills up It will stop when it has reached a safe capacity Brilliant safe and cheap 
I hope my experience was just an anomaly but I was very disappointed with the quality of sewing and strength of materials used in the supports  The anchors are very light gauge and bend very easily when hammering them in The stitching at the securing points were poorly done and missed at the end causing the tent not to lay flat and the post to slip out The support bars dont lock together making it impossible to pull the bars through When the bars come undone they can split easily making the entire structure lop sided The material is very thin and does not radiate heat as well as other previously owned tents Folding the canopy neatly is next to impossible Looks good when its up and design is well thought out even though poor executed 
We have owned this tent for a month or so and we have used it 6 or so times already We had bought it so that my 6 month old wouldnt get too much sun when we are at the beach Ill start off by telling you the features that we like about it  It produces a good amount of shade  Its nice looking  It could double as a camping tent for a child or small adult without gear in a pinch  It has a floor that extends out passed the canopy  If set up correctly it is rock solid against even moderate wind We have not been out in a storm or really heavy winds but you probably wouldnt want to be at the beach bad weather anyway  The back flap can be tied open zipped to a mosquito net or zipped with a nylon flap Very versitile  It packs away in a nice small light package The only thing that I dont like about it is that they used a netted material to make the sleeves that the poles slide through I understand why they chose it and dont really know if there would have been a better material to use They used it so that it doesnt get full of sand and for it to dry very if wet However 90 of the time assembling it you will spend it dealing with the couplings and ends of the poles getting gigged on the netted material If your not careful I can see how it would tear quite easily You have to be patient and take your time sliding it through while helping releasing the snags as they present themselves cause they will It seems as if the slower you try to do it the faster and easier it will go Even with one person Isnt that the case with most things though I like the sandbags If you fill them up all the way and burry them in the sand the tent will be rock solid The stakes are pretty thin and will not work in the sand obviously They dont seem like they will take much hammering unless its really soft dirt Try attaching the filled sand bags before setting it up so you wont have to fight the wind Then move it where you like it and then burry the sandbags to really anchor it down Thats how I do it and it works great Once up you will love it So stop reading any more reviews and buy it already  
Bought this table for camping but use it for parties and gettogethers at home as well Love it due to its easy transportability Folds up and sets up quickly unlike those cumbersome folding card tables Highly recommend for the value 
Pros lots of sun shelter great place for my infant to nap in fun for preschoolers to run around packs up nicely not too difficult to set up Cons sand gets trapped in the poles makes it hard to snap into place sand causes poles to crack replacement kits are available but for a price tends to want to fly in the wind but if you anchor it right and pay attention its not a huge deal bottom line is we enjoyed the tent on the beach and didnt find it hard to set up though its a bit of a chore but the poles break too easily considering it was used as directed at a beach 
I heard some people say that the sleeves for the poles were easily ripped and it made me think twice about buying it Upon receiving the tent and really checking it out I see no problem with the sleeves I think if you were to carelessly shove the poles through then yes they could rip but anyone who is familiar with tent setups will take their time and ensure that this wont happen I would recommend this product to friends any day  Great for anyone with kids and the material has I believe an SPF rating over 50  
It is light enough and sturdy enough to make it very convenient to take it on the road for camping Sure it is not the srongest table in the world but strong enough to satisfy me 
For quick set up in home for puzzles family gatherings etc it is perfect Support for the table is on both ends The middle is supported by the middle hinge which will sag and may fail if a lot of weight is put on the table I made a wooden leg for the center to slip under the table after setting it up and it is sturdy with this setup My leg is 34x1 and has a 1 12 foot glued on The top has a 316 slot to catch the lip of the hinge under the table Without the leg I would only trust the table with things such as chips If you want a heavy duty table this is not for you I like mine for what I bought it for Busy Bee 
great little tent especially for little ones keeps the sun and wind off of you I bought it to help with studying at the beach and it works really well to cut the wind and give some breaks from the sun 


Was not disappointed with this product purchase Great value PrePurchase Selling points when compared to competitive products  UVF rating  Full floor  Front and rear zipable doors  Relative price PostPurchase Selling points  weight  size  Ease of setupeven for noncampers Areas of Improvement  Floor fabric could be thicker perception of frailty causes suspicion of whether or not you would want to place chairs inside  Pole pockets are made out of mesh rather than some competitive products that have fully enclosed pole sleeves This increases the difficulty of setup and in my estimation will be the first area of the tent where we will see wear  tear The mesh easily catches on the flex points of the poles when trying to slide in especially on the long side to side unipole 
I bought this beach shade toof courseuse on the beach I have an 8 month old and he needed shade I thought this looked super cooland it wasafter fighting with it in the 90 degree heat on a sandy beach as the baby screamed and cried It took 15 minutes to set up which doesnt seem like a long time but trust me when I say it was an eternity under the circumstances So15min to put up woudnt really prevent me from using it again because it was pretty near perfect once assembled The teardown on the other hand was a trainwreck Sure it came down in like 5 minutes but the bag it comes in is much too small for the shade to EVER fit back into The poles alone take up about half the space and unless you have serious origami skills infinite patience no wind no sand no water no crying infant you have no hope Im not sure why theyd make a carrying case thats about the size of a handbag but they sure did Overall its just OK in my book 
In short this bag is heavy but thats the cost of a bag rated at 0 degrees You can find lighter 0 degree bags but you will certainly pay more for them On the other hand because the bag is so thick I dont use a sleeping pad so it washes out for me I just used this bag for a winter camping trip it got to the low 20s maybe high teens and I generally felt comfortable No issues with the zipper snagging either which was great Finally the bag rolls up large in the provided sack so I recommend getting a compress bag You can get it down to at least 23s of the size with that method Ive ordered two of these and would recommend them to anyone looking for a good quality bag in this price range 
I bought this bag for my sons back packing trip in the sierras I have another Coleman bag that is not to big for a pack This took up over half the pack Way to bulky and heavy It is probably a great car camping bag 
This worked out really well for me this summer I love going to the beach but sometimes dont like to be in the sun for very long and I really like having a place to keep my cooler purse etc thats not out in the open This worked great It was easy to setup even at the windy ocean beach and I love that it packs up so small and compact It was plenty big enough for a big cooler backpack big beach bag and even room for me to lay down when I got too hot in the sun I havent tried putting a chair and sitting in it it may be too short for that The ability to open the back to allow air through is great All in all a wonderful purchase and I would definitely recommend it 
Used this for our beach trip this summer  we have an 8 month old and I wanted her to have shade and a place to store our belongings while we were in the water Setup was a snap about 5 minutes and the tent was the perfect size for us I put our bags inside and towels down for the baby to roll around on I will say that if you dont open the vent in the back it does get very hot At certain times of day opening the back flap let the sun in but it was essential to get a breeze through there so the baby didnt overheat We only used the stakes 1 day it was really windy the rest of the time we used the sand pockets and it was very secure especially with our bags and towels inside Its too low to actually sit inside  we sat right our chairs on the outside of the tent in the shade and it worked great I bought one for my mother and her fiance as well hes 62 and they both fit comfortably in regular folding chairs Putting it away was pretty easy as well we folded the tent rolled it up tied it and shoved it back in the bag My mother spent a lot of time making it look nice and neat but it does not affect setup and frankly Im too lazy  If you have little ones or plan to be outside and need some shade I highly recommend this tent The baby spent most of her time in there and it was a lifesaver  she didnt get burned at all and had a safe place to play Its great for the beach the park soccer games etc  anywhere you want to set up and have some shade 
Great beach shelter My grandson got in it and had a blast With the window in the back it provides for nice flow through ventilation It was easy to set up although you have to be careful with the shock corded poles you can poke someones eye out with that thing comes to mind Disassembly is just as easy but the barrel connectors could be rounded on the edges to make removal a bit easier When closing the shelter up make sure that the door or window is open about a foot or so otherwise it will be difficult to get the air out of it to fold it up I didnt use the stakes we had enough gear that we stowed inside to keep the shelter in place during a NorEaster The shelter overall is well built With proper care and maintenance it should last for quite a while I would suggest that anytime it is used near a saltwater environment that it be rinsed with fresh water and allowed to dry completely before stowage 
It is OK once it is put together but it is one pain in the neck to put up The sand bag idea was not thought out It needs to be secure to the ground before you can even start thinking about erecting it We had a hard time with it using the stakes into dirt so I know it would not be fun putting up on the beach We wound up ordering another tent I wish I could return it UPDATE 2013  We had this tent for a couple a years now and never used it again so we gave it to my Daughter to try and use it on the beach for her two small girls She could not put it together and gave it back to us We would not recommend it and wish we never bought this wast of money tent  We hope Coleman reads this and discontinues it  Brian Cianfrani 
Bought this specifically to use on an overnight scuba trip on a boat and it was great It was almost too warm i unzipped the bottom and let my feet breath D but no complaints at all Will definitely be using again 
Nice fluffy and warm 
Super warm solid item 
Arrived on time and in good condition Time consuming to put up larger than most beach shades Ive had Easy to carry but bag fell apart quickly 
I purchased two of these bags kept one for myself and gave one to a friend Used this bag for some winter camping the last two winters We stayed in shelters that stayed around 20 degrees at night I slept GREAT The very first night I used this bag it dipped around the zero mark and I made the mistake of putting my mouth in the bag so I did get some condensation in the bag After figuring that out dumb mistake I never did it again I was warm for each trip when a couple of the guys with us had more expensive 0 degree bags and were cold I did use a layer of reflectex under the bag as we were sleeping above a very thin layer of foam above the ice and snow I did wear a base layer while sleeping and I do sleep fairly warm I just put my bag away for the season and gave it a once over and all the seams are still good and the bag is in perfect shape If you are a backpacker this bag does not compress well even with a compression bag Its a big heavy warm bag I did not get it wet from the outside so I do not know how water resistant the outer layer is 
Think of it as 12 a dome tent Its a pretty decent setup and well mademaybe not completely beach ready tho Sand in the shock poles can make it next to impossible to take apart at the end of the day and the whole thing doesnt drain sandatall Get ready to do a lot of shaking If you plan to be on the beach for the entire day its a great shelter to bring along If youre going down for a few hours just bring an umbrealla This would be a little too much effort to put up and tear down 
Took it down to 17 F And was toasty Love this bag It is on the big side 
warm enough for winter days 
Good sleeping bag for the price although I doubt it would do well in 0 degree weather 
I just got back from camping at Pismo Beach this past weekend and Im so happy I had this to keep me warm Average day temperature was high 50s then dropped down to mid 30s at night I wore a tech shirt and yoga pants and socks to sleep and this kept me fairly warm My feet was a bit cold but that is my fault Instead of trying to roll it back in I stuffed the sleeping bag starting from the foot Im 53 and there was a lot of room still for me to sleep on my side The only con to this is that its very bulky Wouldnt be suitable for backpacking Definitely recommend this 
Great sleeping bag Comfortable and easy to stash Kept me warm even in 34 celsius The hood is very useful Best used in conjunction with some form of sleeping mat 
High quality sleeping bag at a great price 
Kept me very comfortable to around 25 degrees so far Will not fit back into the supplied compression bag youll need a new one 
This bag is bulky and comfortable to be inside of I slept inside an unheated cabin on a raised canvas cot I used a fleece liner inside and was still cold It was about 30 F inside the cabin Mostly I felt some cold from below Maybe if I was on the floor it would have felt warmer since no air would be circulating under me My son was on the floor in a 0 F down mummy bag with liner and was warm all night Bottom line for me at least this bag is marginal at 30 F temps I cant imagine it being warm enough for 20s or below The zipper side baffles work well though Ive been in other bags that had leaky zippers which is terrible For the price not bad 
I bought this in early December Now its broken with a zipper that cant be repaired again Garbagehere it comes 
great bag cozy and roomy 
Very warm Sometimes a bit too warm Great for cold weather 
Very warm good price but so darn bulky 
Very warm 
It isnt very wide for an adult sleeping bag I had issues getting it to zip up Im 511 270lbs I ended up giving it to my wife for when we camp 
I buy these for the warming center They are perfect for what we need 
I bought this as a possible replacement for my Coleman Peak1 Quallofil bag Its not that good Its OKbut not the bag my older Coleman wasand still is I have a Marmot to use when its actually cold but sometimes a less than bag is what fits the bill This bag fits the less than use its just not as good as the Quallofil Coleman used to use The Peak 1 bag was considerably more expensive Except for the construction type and fill weights being similar maybe its an appletooranges comparison The temp ratings of the two were similar 
These are very nice sleeping bags for the price Quality and warm Good for camping car prepping 

Thank You 
Decent productnot sure about 0degree either Biggest con is that once you have taken out of fabric carrierREALLY hard to get back in properlyColeman kinda dropped ball on that 
We got this with great price around 2500 so we ordered 2 bags After we opened the bag it was really warm and cozy but when we put them back it couldnt get it I think I should make a cover bag but Nice 
a little tight for me I am 6 tall and 200 pounds I would have preferred to have the wider bag rather than the mummy bag but I didnt want to pay to exchange it It is VERY warm though 
Outstanding warm bag Unzips to footbed for blanket use in warmer weather Especially like the inner collar preventing drafting Wish my slumberjack had this feature in the 80s when backpacking the Bitterroot mountains The supplied stuff sack is mainly for overseas shipping in smallest volume Get a bigger sack to stuff this bag  for longevity stuff it  dont roll it 
heaviest bag ever They grouped it into lightweight category2lbs which it is not I think its around 7lbs and did not list accurate weight in description 
The mummy sleeping bag is thick and warm But because of that it takes up a lot of space even when stuffed in the bag Also Im only 510 medium build and I felt very uncomfortably constrained inside the bag I wish the foot area had at least 6 wider and the shoulder area could be 6 wider also 
Slept in this on Jan 13 2018 in 25 F temps and stayed warm all night long Shoulders are a little crowded but it is a mummy bag so it was expected Drawstring on the face felt a little odd to me but it did indeed keep warmth in the bag If there is anything I would like to see changed would be the drawstring latches as they are plastic and dont always hold real well so some retightening may be needed Have not tried in warmer temps yet but will be in the next few weeks depending on the weather All in all though I am definitely NOT disappointed 
Its a bit bulky but holy cow does it keep you warm The weight matches the bulk so if your a backpacker keep that in mind I used this with a bag liner in below zero temps and was snug as a bug Coleman has been around for lifetime and always has reliable gear Great bag 
Product came very easy get out of the box very nicely packed very hard to get back in the little packet came in I am 6 foot 1 inch 240 lb and that fit very well the whole way up except for my broad shoulders it was very very difficult to get inside The draw string that closes around your shoulders and neck slides and holds well Its currently 8 degrees out side Update after testing at 4 degrees full exposure no tent Unit worked to trap in heat mostly feet notice an cold temp and after inspection the feet area should be slightly better insulated than the rest of the body because the feet dont produce heat at the same lvl as your body If you put on some wool socks I truly believe this unit will just pass 0 degree 
Although this was a gift to the wife and she is not a fan of mummy bags she uses it when it gets cold and damp and I have used it a few times camping at the Coast in cool damp weather Woks great and has held up great 
The sleeping bag does not perform as rated Slept on a mat on an improvised wood and brush platform in a one man pup tent so I certainly wasnt on the ground Minor frostnip on fingers and toes from trying this Tested this out overnight in 0F with high humidity moderate wind low altitude minor precipitation Wind and snow were mitigated by the tent As someone that spends more time outdoors than indoors its sad that the product didnt perform It may get someone killed with the false advertising Otherwise its a comfortable camping indoors bag It cant perform in the mountains and weighs too much to be a 3season Takes up too much space to be a decent longterm backpacking sleeping partner Oh and the stuff sacks bottom handle tore off as I was removing the product from the box While the fart sack is okay the stuff sack is garbage How steaming garbage 
fast delivery bargain price 
Will not be disappointed Excellent quality Will be purchasing another so we will all have one 
Works great and keeps u warm Very large and bulky Not for backpacking at all However very warm bag for cold camping 
Spent 1291218 roadtripping a snowboard trip from Jackson Hole to Sun Valley and onto Bend Oregon I spent that week sleeping in a tent atop an element Every night was around 0 degrees aside from a hoodie socks and leggings this bag was all that kept me alive Sleeping in an enclosed tent the condensation from our breath would freeze the inside of the tent and our bags This thing is great Comfortable in 0 degree weather also works great as a comforter on my bed at home I dont need much 
It does keep you warm in very cold conditions However it is not made for anyone over 6 tall I feel like I am in a straight jacket You cannot take two and zip them together to share your space with your spouse I would have returned them but we used them two night before we discovered the discomfort I will have to give them away We will never sleep in them again 
Im sure its very warm but impossible to put back inside of the bag Like really 
Sorry But Im very disappointed I just got it and I try it First I really should have listen for that people who gave one star Its not for backpacking It is very heavy and really big The amazon shows to buy with TENTON back pack Its funny I have same TENTON backpack and this sleeping bag is really no way to fit in it I didnt try the 0 temperature but I dont feel different then Tough Outdoor sleeping bag 20 also from Amazon for almost same price when I try it at home So if I dont feel extremely warm in it in my apartment how can keep me warm in 0 temperatures I wish send back but for the price I keep it But I wont able to use much I was looking for winter sleeping bag for my backpacking I dont want risk this bag Update I returned I dont trust in this bag for winter backpacking and its useless I lost 10 for return I found a Marmot Never Summer on sale what I can trust for my first winter backpacking around 0 degree 
For the price I paid this is a nice 0 degree synthetic bag I usually go down only It is not too heavy and packs well It seems very well made I was a little upset at first when I popped on the bag and it showed up at 2000 after I paid 31 lightning deal two weeks prior When I called Amazon to maybe compensate the difference we both went back and it showed 3600 I still have the screen shot showing 20 I think that particular supplier was selling the last ones at that price The other dealers wanted 36 plus I feel bad that I sort of chewed out the Amazon rep over it The price I paid was well worth the quality of the bag so far but we all want the best price available 
AMAZING Sleeping bags very warm Perfect for cold weather 
Will buy again 
I upgraded the SRAM MRX shifters on my MTB dislike twist shifters along with an adequate but low end Tourney TX31 rear derailleur to these 3x8 Alivio shifters and a Deore LX RD Adjusted the RD and secured the shifter cables Now I experience crisp and fast shifts This set up with midrange components should satisfy my offroad and road riding needs for years to come I take care of my bikes so components should last another decade 
Frist let me say they came on time Good packaging I bought these to replace the original ones on a new bike They shift very good and improved the Bike as far as Im concerned Directions make them an easy install 
These shifters came on my Trek 4500 MTB They worked great and never got out of adjustment for a year and a half Then one day the right shifter broke and I was unable to shift into higher gears without forcing the shifter into my handgrip I opened them up to see if I could fix it by pure luck but when a metal piece that had broken off fell out of the case as I opened it I figured it was not fixable I did some quick forum searching and gathered that many Shimano shifters are non rebuildable so if you want a cheap disposable shifter that works well this one fits the bill I gave it 4 stars cause its pretty good for a lower end shifter It didnt get 5 cause it broke in under 2 years My riding consists of weekend rides on fireroads with the family some light commuting when the weather is bad and I dont want to ride my motorcycle in the rain and a very rare 10 mile single track loop near the home I am near the coast and my bike does have rust on many of the screws so that could have attributed to the premature breakdown 
Ordered this for our Boy Scout not impressed Upon arrival both the weight and the stuff dimensions greatly exceeded what was listed Also the fabric was very stiff Tried to go the cheap route for our 10 year old boy but I think we need to spend more and order a quality bag Weve had quality name brand bags for 12 years so I should have known you get what you pay for I guess the kiddo gets the same That being said this bag would probably do quite well if you were going to use it car camping 
Used this sleeping bag during camping when the night was below 40F and it was super warm The only down side is that this sleeping is heavy and hard to put it back in the bag since its so puffy I would not use this for backpacking tho just because its too heavy 
Nice and warm 
This bag is thick But i was in the mid twenties and i was warm 
Im sure the bag will be fine It appears to be made well and should be plenty warm for my wife However the stuff sack in which the bag is enclosed and is intended to be kept is ridiculously small When I had a great deal of trouble just getting the sleeping bag out of the sack I knew I was going to have trouble getting it back into the sack and boy did I It took every bit of 30 minutes and a lot of pushing straining and hand cramps getting it back into the sack Coleman make the back just a little larger and it will be fine I bet some engineer said Oh dont worry about it Theres plenty of clearance Added after use My wife says it is very comfortable but she was still extremely cold at 40 degrees F It will be just fine for her if the nights are a little warmer I suspect for most people with normal cold resistance it will be fine 
Great shifters They look great work great and are simple to install and use Cant ask for a better product and the price is great 
Used these to upgrade the SUPER ANNOYING grip shifters that came on our Trek T700 So far they have held up really nicely to some rough trail riding I am getting some clean accurate shifts and have no reason to expect anything less in the foreseeable future For the price I really think these cant be beat Couple notes 1 You cant use these with an 8 speed SRAM derailleur Sorry if that is too obvious 2 Make sure your cable cutters are sharp and will give you a nice clean cut if you are reusing cables Or just get new cables The slightest fraying or bent wire will make it extremely difficult to thread the cable through the shifter 
The stock EF50 brake lever8 speed shifter combo was starting to act up even after adjusting I wanted an upgrade rather than getting a newer EF51 I already had separate Deore brake levers to go with this Alivio shifter It was easy to install and adjust the derailleur only use the 8 speed right shifter since my Trek is a 1x8 and shifting was much crisper and solid feeling 
Zipper broke just like countless others Once it comes off its impossible to put back on and will not keep you warm with the zipper broken I got between 23 months of use before the zipper broke I guess I got my monies worth but it looked so durable I thought I would get more use from it 
Super warm Super heavy 5lbs and no at all packable Great sleeping bag if youre homeless why I bet with this sleeping bag you could be King of the homeless people Rule a small area with a swish of a found wiper blade Other wise good for car camping and people who dont know better 
If you glamp camp yearround like we do this bag is amazing Finally were not cold in the tent Ive used it in weather down to 29degrees and I was sooo warm and comfy wearing just yoga pants and a tee Its not heavy at allunless you hikein Obviously its not made for carrying on your back I originally planned on shelling out ducats for Kelty or REI and was skeptical about Coleman quality and the low price But Im honestly impressed Reinforced zipper resists snagging strong stitching velcro wont scratch you like my other bag Its a stuff sack so you push it into the sack instead of rolling it which is pretty easy for me My kids are 5 and Im 59 and we all fit comfortably in them without feeling claustrophobic But I wonder if it would be too narrow for a taller man with broad shoulders Possibly TIP To make the bag last longer and require less washing esp since its fluffy I bought Friendly Swede Spacious Travel Sacks Think of them as inserts Instead of having to wash the whole sleeping bag after camping you just throw the insert in the wash 
Used this bag at deer camp in southern Ohio for shotgun week Temps went down to 28 degrees one night and besides my exposed face freezing I was comfortable Good bag for the price and fit me perfect 511 180lb 
Probably not the lightest things out there My wife has had these on her Jamis Coda for years still going strong I just set up my Surly Crosscheck as a flat bar and needed some cheap shifters These fit the bill but there is no complain They are perfect in every way to me 
They are usable but do not want to work well with my Alivio rear derailleur that is a couple years old I dont know if its the age difference or something else going on 
I got this to replace the shifters on my old 8speed XTR equipped bike I upgraded to Avid BB7 mechanical disks and had to replace the brake levers since the old XTR shifter brakes were integrated and dont work well with the Avid brakes These shifters work flawlessly and other than a lack of mud covers for the cable to shifter interface and the stupid shift indicators I have no complaints 
Works perfectly and was a breeze to install Crisp shifting for front and rear replacing grip shift system which was sub par Other than cosmetics very similiar in perfromance as Deore and great for an all around mid level mt bike 
It is great works great good deal great product would recommend it to anyone that was looking for something simular 
I bought this shifter set because I upgraded my brakes along with the brake lever Since the bike came with an integrated shifterbrake lever I had to order a new set of shifter I had the LBS install this for me and its been working out pretty well since last week Shift is some what smooth although I think the rear derailer is causing the hick ups Not complaining though it does what its suppose to do and its light enough to not add noticeable weight to the bike If you need to replace your old shifter set for your hybrid bike this is actually a very affordable set to get 
I used this in a cold weather situation last week and stayed toasty warm Have not tried below 35 degrees yet 
I used this for a camping trip in the California Sierras It was pretty cold up there at night but once I got into the bag I was warm I never got too hot to where I was sweaty The bag kept me very comfortable 
Have yet to field test but so far so good 
Super warm and a bit cramped which might have been a mistake to buy for warmer climates but as an outdoor bag I think it would be great I havent tried camping outside yet so I cant comment on the necessity of a blanket under a enu yet 
Work well for our purposes Kept us warm in temps of about 45 Havent used them in real winter yet but all in all a great buy 
Kept my warm and it was comfy Only used it a few times mainly for music festivals Well worth it 
Warm and light Very good for backpacking 
great cheap bag zipper is nice and material holds up well not for any kind of hiking 
GOOD QUALITY VERY NICE 
it really gets warm light in weight but it takes lots of space on your backpack so it may not quite efficient for backpacking 
I have only used this once on a night that was about 45 degrees F It worked great and was super comfortable It looks like it will hold up well in the washing machine and would easily fit a large man I had plenty of space in it and I am a woman that is 58 This is a great price for such a nice sleeping bag It is a little hard to get it back into the stuff sack but I guess that is the point so it takes up less room when travelling 
Im 6 foot and this bag is snug Not too tight but a bit more room would be appreciated Used in a tent for some 40 degree nights and stayed nice and warm 
Went camping in late november in northern Wisconsin and it snowed that night I was nice and toasty in this bag Temps got down to upper 20s and I felt fine and we were sleeping in a summer tent dont ask It was a fun night and for the price this sleeping bag certainly handled the job I dont know if I would use this for any lower than 20s though 
Never too hot If youre uncomfortable remove some clothing Other than that Ive slept without a tent a few times with this keeps me super warm 
I am 61 and 285 pounds and this bag fits a tad tight I am loosing weight so the bag will fit better the next time I need it It kept me warm in high 20s Fahrenheit 

Christmas gift 
Great price and fast shipping  
Not products fault so will rate a 4 but I cant stand the confinement of a mummy bag Had to send back 
Kept me nice and snuggly in about 35 degree weather Good purchase for me I like the velcro at the top so the bag cant slowly unzip while you sleep 
I spent 3 days in a tent with temps below 30 degrees and stayed toasty the entire time even got to warm a time or 2 Definitely a great purchase 
Traditional bagnothing special not lightweight 
I have used this sleeping bag for backpacking It isnt the best bag for backpacking since it is quite large I suppose a compression sack might be able to squish it down to a more reasonable size that could fit better in a pack The bag itself though is comfortable and warm I used it in 40 degree weather so I didnt test the limits on temperature Overall a decent bag for the price 
I love these I absolutely love this sleeping bag 
The quality of the sleeping bag is great I am 6 ft 2 and I fit in okay I work out so my shoulders are wider than the average person it does feel a little tight once the bag is fully zipped up If I had the chose I dont think I would go for the mummy bag again Other than that the sleeping bag is very warm 
Its warm and comfortable but the bottom zipper is broken Its straight up doesnt work at all right out of the box I expected it to be finicky due to the other reviews but its not just delicate its completely misaligned If it wasnt on sale I would be sending it back but a one way zipper for the price is good enough 
I am 6 and 215 This bag is way too small for me Its warm but way to small you cant even turn in it 
Great product for the money very warm but also very bulky and heavy for multiple day backpacking trips unless you dont mind the extra size and weight 
good items 
Excellent product well madefast shipping will do business again many thanks HS 
Great value Performs as expected 
4 Stars bc we havent tested it out yet but it feels really warm and thick enough to be comfortable  
Im 62 and I fit snuggly in this Sleeping bag Good product for its low price 
Great sleeping bag and kept you plenty warm Came in more of a bluegray color  just a heads up 
Light and warm cant beat that 
The zipper can be a pain but its very warm Its nearly impossibly and takes an act of congress to get the sleeping bag back in the sack it comes in 
Had not try it on cold weather yet Hope it can keep me warm in winter camping 
This was amazing Warm and comfortable 
Great sleeping bag There are some better but they cast a lot more For the money this is a great value 
Very confortable and war sleepbag 
Good quality 
I have used this multiple times in 2030 degree weather It kept me pretty warm although I was also wearing multiple layers of clothing I am 62 and fit in it snuggly If you are any taller you may have more trouble than me It is a little constricting on the legs but that is expected when you have a mummy bag but otherwise it was pretty comfortable It isnt too hard to fit back into the sack but is not a backpacking sleeping bag so it doesnt store very compactly Overall a good sleeping bag for a good price 
keeps me warm in sub 30 degree weather 
Tent camping in 10f Bag held up okay with a foil blanket covering me It is an adult mummy bag but felt a little tight Overall its okay for what it is intended for Id buy it again 
The bag seems decent for the price assuming its for standard camping in which you have plenty of space in your cartrucketc and itll go from the trunk to the tent and back again When in the stuff sack it comes with its massive I have a medium 88L Osprey backpack which ends up being 94L and this wouldnt fit inside or attach to the outside After CONSIDERABLE effort I managed to stuff it in a medium sea to summit compression sack GREAT sack by the way and that helped to cut the size down to 15x9 originally 2022x12 but I would never want to do that every morning You could fit it into a large CS with less effort but then it likely wouldnt fit into the sleeping bag compartment of your backpack I ended up returning it and buying a Teton Sports 5 degree ferienheit bag that was half the size of this one and only 20 more expensive They also have a 20 bag that is around 13 of the size in its stuff sack or 14 the size of you put it in a compression sack for pretty much the same price The tent and sleeping pad are more important anyway and my 4 season tent inflatable sleeping pad and the other sleeping bag I bought take up about the same amount of room as this one sleeping bag If spaceweight have no influence on your decision this is a good bag for the price However for a little more you can get a 5 or 20 bag at a fraction of the size 
Very warm and fluffy we camped deep in the mountains with these and it kept us very warm 
great quality bag 
I use it on my couch watching netflix and get HOT I cant wait for it to stop raining so I can camp in the cold weather with it 
Warm to 32 I still have to try below that but I was toasty 
KEPT ME WARM IN SOUTH DAKOTA 
This bag worked great for me I was in about 5 F weather and I was comfy using thermal underwear and a sweatshirt The only downside is that it doesnt pack down nearly as small as my friends down bag But it also didnt cost several hundred dollars So its a trade off but it is a great bag for the price 
Omg these were so much nicer than I was honestly expecting What a deal 
Very comfortable 
A well built sleeping bag but you will need a compression sack to get it smaller Comes with a sack but doesnt compress it The zippers are strong and look to be long lasting 
Very nice Great buy 
I slept in this bag in 20 degree weather inside a tent and again inside a car It really keeps you warm 
Second one of these I purchased One for each of my sons  both Boy Scouts Both work great  no complaints 
Kept me warm in 30 degree weather but it is too bulky for backpacking 
I just bought this sleeping bag for some winter camping in Wisconsin Its definitely kind of bulky for something like backpacking but for car camping its no problem Its a warm comfortable sleeping bag Night temperatures varied from windy 24 to 33 With this sleeping bag I was never intensely cold but I wasnt very warmcomfortable wearing two layers across by the time morning came I think that more comes down to not having warm sleeping pads I just doubled two old foam sleeping pads and then draped those with a big blanket Its a pretty nice sleeping bag all said and Im happy with this purchase 
Pretty nice hat 
I bought this very same hat twenty years ago And I havent found the perfect shape and build of a hat since So naturally when the boys in Blue made their NCAA run this year I ordered another Zephyr It was like a time warp when I unwrapped it Totally cool And they fellas at Zephyr enjoyed the picture I tweeted to them 
Said it weighs 15 lbs  Does not  
Ive used this Coleman north rim adult mummy sleeping bag a few nights just at home to test it out and have found it to be very warm and Comfortable  Something I didnt thing about when purchasing though is how narrow it is at the shoulders  Im only 59 tall so plenty of leg room but at 265lbs im very wide at the shoulders and its a little tight  its ok with me im still happy with the purchase but I would say if youre a 4x or 5x shirt look for something larger  
These will be used for homeless veterans in my area They will be appreciated I am sure Especially with the 4 degree weather we are having 
They dont break when me and the other students train with the old wood bokkens we find that they are yes great but when I brought my cold steel bokken in and tried it out after I had gotten it I took note to the fact of they are flexible on contact and the grip can be ruffed up more with sandpaper if you like a ruff grip that is I found with this bokken over my wood bokken that it was lighter then I thought it would be more like a live blade but less like a wood bokken  but hurts the same My personal opinion of it it is not great for endurance drills so that your arm muscles use the weight of the wood in both the cut and the ready stances to build up for a live blade and the faster cut with the live blade from using the wood bokken but as I said this is very minor difference that most that buy this as there first bokken will not know I still have and use my wood bokkens for drills and solo training but when it comes down to sparing I use this mostly because of the fact of I have had a Japanese White Oak bokken shatter on me that was a 50 dollar bokken and everyone thinks that price is everything I will NEVER give anything 5 out of 5 to be honest nothing is perfect but this is really really close to a VERY good all around bokken Update I have had the same one I ordered here now for a few years I have beaten the put choice word here you wish to use out of it even against wood bokkens other then a few dents along the front edge that it has gotten because of this it still lives It has been used for drills and it has even been used for the occasional hard competitions around the dojo 
Great and tough Cold Steel makes great products but it is a little on the light side for a good work out 
The little zipper guard thing is useless  mine came off the rails the first time I used it But Coleman immediately shipped me a replacement so clearly they stand by their warranty and their product Love this company and I have stayed very warm manyacold night in this thing Love the velcro inside to help seal out drafts Incredible value Generally would only recommend this for car camping as it is incredibly large and does not compress well due to the synthetic materials If youre looking for a serious backpacking sleeping bag for deep winter camping Im afraid youre going to have to spend a lot more money and go with real down fill Nothing beats its warmth and compressibility Otherwise this is the bag for you 

This is a great practice sword Its so close to being the real thing  what I mean is the details  From the handle to the full length of the sword Even the weight is close to that of being a real samurai sword and to anyone interested in using the sword  This is the best sword to buy and learn with  if you are studying the way of the samurai  Dont forget to also buy the short sword which is also made with the same fine details  quality as this one is 
The rubber piece will break after being exposed to oxygen for an extended period of time 
Great Very sturdy and perfect weight for training I use it almost daily to practice my skills on the standing heavy bag D 
These are much better practice sword than traditional hardwood bokkens They feel a bit awkward at first but you will quickly get used to the weight difference They work better if you weight down the handles with something I tape a metal pummel to the end to help balance out If you are handy you can probably put some metal inserts into the plastic grip 
Amazing cold steel is at its best here super durable and great feel lightweight 
Baseball bat with style 
cold steel dose it again love these for training 
looks sturdy retaining ring immediately broke while trying to install it 35  40 stars 
This sword is amazing It was a gift for my son and he loves the realistic look and feel but no one is getting cut 
Great bag for the price Have used in 30 degrees and have been very warm 
Keeps my kiddo warm for his cold boy scouting camping trips Great buy 
good 
Ive been beating on a hand and a half and a gladius with this not to mention a shield and dagger I was a little concerned it might not be able to go headtohead with the much thicker and heavier hand and a half but so far not a problem at all 
Well constructed and nice weight 
awesome product 
These were plastic and not actually cold steel Very misleading now i am contemplating getting the wood ones 
Exactly as advertised Deadlyish 
Comfortable down to the 20s If I got warm I had to zip down a bit Stash pocket kept my keys close by The zipper has a wind guard Previous reviews complained about not getting it back in the stuff sack I had no problem 
Excellent quality and warmth Bought this for my wife for a overnight camping trip in the local hills Packs easily in the included stuff bag 
I honestly wish there were 6 stars for these Went camping in 30 degrees with them and was super toasty in there No they arent light No they are certainly not small when in the stuff sack So its a horrible option for backpacking If youre car camping though this is super awesome Especially at this price 
Great training tool 
Great Bokken Been using this for a couple months and it holds up great Very solid and has good weight Nice smooth handle and comes complete with a hand guard 
Bought for my son to hammock camp on a scouting trip Temps were in upper 30s in a hammock with no underquilt Only other insulation he used was he place some felttype fabric inside the hammock to use as a kind of sleeping pad He slept in shorts and a tshirt with a sweatshirt hoodie and said he stayed very warm all night Even said he woke up once a little too warm and had to unzip a bit Overall he loves this bag Im convinced and am wanting to find this same bag but in a larger size being a big guy Definitely would buy again 
This bag slept comfortably although a little on the warm side at a damp 50 degree 2 day campout with my sons Cub Scout pack It is a little on the small side I am 511 and 180lbs and it was snug If you are any larger you might want to look at a bigger bag 
Sharplooking fitted hat 

A lightning ship Thanks 
Got mine in front of the door yesterday and tore the packaging open like a mad dog This is the 1st polypropylene Cold Steel product Ive ever owned so I was quite surprised  impressed on how sturdy it was being made out of hard plastic yet it gave a bit of flex but in the end retained its shape My mind wondered off today and it slid outta my hands and created a small dent in the wall lol good thing no one else was in the room  First thing I noticed out the box was the Tsuba and the Tsuba Ring not sure of the technical term for the rubber ring came in a separate plastic pouch with clear instructions and pictures for assembly Just note that itll take some muscles to assemble the Tsuba onto the bokken I left mine off for storage purposes  Gave it a few nice hard whacks during the day today  it didnt deform at all until due to my retardedness it slipped out of my hands and flew into a wall Gave my wall a nice little dent and had a bit of plastic curve over on the tip like how the edge of a knife curves due to use not really noticeable but its visible under close inspection Also unlike a wooden bokken when it breaks it wont splinter  Havent gotten to really putting it under a ton of use and pressure but for the price of 2080 at least thats the price of my purchase its totally worth the cash Totally recommend this product to anyone looking for a quality bokken for either their training or just as a decorative piece for the wall  UPDATE March 6th 2015 Ive put the tsuba and the rubber ring that holds it in place on the bokken a day or two ago just to try out how that felt Today just got back from work thought Id play with it a bit took it out and found out the Tsuba Ring broke on me If I had to describe how it broke Id say it was more like someone took a knife and cut it down one side the break is clean  smooth Although I dont know how it broke the Tsuba is currently useless to me The bokken still holds EXTREMELY well so my rating will stay 5 stars Kenny 
This is a great sleeping bag I used it this weekend and had the most comfortable sleep ever My son is a scout and we camp a lot Even though it wasnt very cold I was really comfortable and I can tell that when it gets colder I will still be comfy and cozy I did not use the head portion this time due to the temps but cant wait This is well made and a very good value Highly recommend 
Really cool and fun item 1 star off for having a slightly bent tip of the blade 
Nicely made rugged and great for practice or exercise Nothing I can say that hasnt been said in other reviews 
broke easily 
Pretty heavy and long but this thing feels incredible right out of the box Very tough with a good weight on it this is a great purchase 
Cold steel always makes great stuff I got this because I didnt want to buy a real Katana yet and let me say this thing feels awesome and hard as rock Only 1 little problem is the sliding hang guard loose after awhile swinging it around but you can glue it if you really need to Honestly its not that big of a deal and you can always take it off if you want 
Good sleeping bag for chilli nights Not so easy to get back into the bag though  
The bag itself seems well designed For the price it was OK Problem was the seam on the foot end of the bag was already opened up It looked like the original thread had torn or not been sewn correctly Too much trouble to send back and only the thread was missing the material itself was intact and easy enough to sew closed Will see how it holds up under use This was a highly rated bag though the bag itself had a nice thick loft and really not that heavy The zipper is not heavy duty but this was an inexpensive bag Not sure what the embroidered lantern on the tip surface is all about I do like the additional inside chest baffel 
Its a great bag just kind of big 
Great sleeping bag Will keep you nice and warm down into the 30s Havent tested it lower than that yet 
Nice bag Keeps my boy nice and warm 
I fell in love with this bokken already 
Grandson lived it 
 
I think this thing is ok not great There are some proof videos demonstrate its power by destroy some pallets I think those pallets were made from cheap soft woods I tried to hit the pallets in my warehouse we are using treated hard wood pallets the pallets wont break I can lift 300 lbs I dont think my strength is any weaker than those people on the video Also the proof video often says after hit xxxx this thing is not damaged no sign of wear and tear WRONG It will get scratch really bad If you really want to get something blunt for self defense I suggest Cold Steel Indian War Club Its deadly and it can destroy hard wood pallets like cutting cake with a knife Well of course this thing is not design for self defense so I wont lower its review score I only took one star off for its not as strong as the video that I saw 
This is a wonderful bokken The traditional wooden ones break easier so I went with this My martial arts class has used synthetic bokkens like this maybe the same one But its light and awesome Its even light enough to use it onehand but twohanded is better because of the length and handling it 
It is not possible to get a feel for this item from reviews I read them all and was still surprised pleasantly when I got this bokken I took it on a camping trip with nieces and nephews and everyone was whacking stuff with it all weekend long and it mostly just got dirty Now I wish I knew how to use it 
This bokken is much lighter and easier to weld than O Bokken Adults can weld this sword onehanded If welded with two hands this sword is very fast 
great pratice sword very strong 
Great bag for the money Highly recommend 
Great product 
This would be a great sleeping bag if I could fit in it Im only 510 and its impossible for me to get all the way inside it Im currently looking for another one I can say that itll keep your body warm in temperatures below freezing if youre wearing a layer or 2 of clothing and a beanie 
I like it better then wooden bokken But the plastic is very smooth so I suggest buying some grip tape or some other wrapping type 
This is great for sparring Hurts to hit hard So take it slow until you get good Scuffs but doesnt dent 
been playing with it for a month now and really like it Plus I dont have to worry about cutting off my kneecaps 
I bought a nicecheap and very sharp Shirasaya Samurai Katana Once I started swinging the thing around I realized that something or someone could get seriously damaged very quickly I bought the Cold Steel Bokken Very nice product Practice all you want with it Will not break and can do some serious damage I have rarely even taken the sharp Katana out No need to if you have this Bokken Cheers 
Great bag Not for your ultra light snobs it will pack down small enough to fit inside of a mountaineering pack if a compression sack is used Its a 5 pounder so dont expect to carry it on your trip across the country As far as temperature ratings goeach human has different temperature regulation and or metabolic make up weight body fat how efficient we burn our caloriesetc That being said  A zero degree sleeping bag for a skinny person with circulation problems is most likely going to get a miserable nights sleep while in below freezing temperatures  but this sleeping bag for a normal healthy person properly outfitted will most likely keep them comfortable in temperatures well below freezing Im comparing this sleeping bag to my good old Northface Bigfoot 5F synthetic sleeping bag that I have had for many yearsand I have to say based on loft weight and design I see no reason why this sleeping bag wouldnt keep you warm and protected from hypothermia in winter conditions Im not talking Mt Everest here But for your 4 season camping adventurer I think with the proper tent and gear it would work just fine I cannot believe the price to quality on this thing 
Havent tried it yet but Coleman is a good bet 
Small for regular size male Im 6 ft and 220 lbs and this bag is too tight for me 
Great bag for the price Works just as well as some of our more pricy sleeping bags Definitely a great value 
Keep me warm in the rainy cold camping night 
This is for my son but I find myself using it Very strong and durable Fun to hit things with it 
I cant break it Dents and dings on the spine of the blade nothing else Less lethal impact weapon Great fun with the kids too Very pointy though 
Really sturdy since I really played rough with them and wacked them against my Cold Steel Hand and a Half polypropylene sword Just be careful with the guard since I read some reviews stating that they are not as sturdy as the rest of the sword Yet still fun 
Cool Bokken solid and the same length as my Katana Great for practice Only wish it came with a sheath 
I have heard the temperature ratings of sleeping bags are often misleading and I think I agree for this bag First I always run cold and wear wool socks year round so take that as you will Last year I used this bag in PA with snow on the ground probably between 1020F outside I was cold but my feet were frozen I had to keep a fire going to keep my feet warm which were not in the bag because I could not sleep  When I was on MD on the AT this past March nighttime temp about 3040F I was more comfortable Slept through the night The stuff sack is adequate but does not compact the bag enough for me I use a smaller bags sack like the one my Coleman palmetto came with or a compression stuff sack from Sea to Summit Overall I like the bag a lot the double closure system one around your face and one around your shoulders is great to regulate air a bit between your torso and head or isolate it My only complaint is that there is a more honest temperature rating system in place 
Bought 3 of these over the years Had an issue with a zipper and coleman replaced the entire bag free after a year of use Great company 
This is a great bag However its big Not recommended for backpacking Absolutely if you are just camping or doing a quick day hike OTherwise your pack will be all sleeping bag Overall a solid bag for a good price 
Excellent It kept my husband so warm he unzipped the side and left it open Great bang for your buck if you are looking for an affordable sleeping bag 
Is this a backpack camping bag No No it is not Did I stay warm and comfortable while my friends with backpack bags froze No they were fine as well but they paid ALOT more than I did and we were camping out of the cars I actually got a little over heated on the night it only got down to 45 but if you are looking for a cheap bag that works this is it and the bulkiness adds a little extra padding for your back as well 100 satisfied 
I just got two of them today and have been sparring with them all day But I feel Im ready to write a review on it so here we go Durability is not an issue with these bokken At first I thought it may be but they can take some pretty heavy usage as long as you dont beat down a metal post with it Me and my wife have been smacking these around about as much as you would in a tournament and they are barely even scuffed The only removable part would be the handguard or tsuba but this is Murica so Im gonna use English The handguard is pretty tough to slip into its place but not impossible The Oring keeps it on really well too ALMOST no slippage although after a couple of bouts it does come out of place a very little bit The grip is really comfortable HOWEVER when your hands start sweating it does get a little slippery but I would recommend gloves and other safety gear anyway so no complaint here It also weighs and handles really closely to my katana and it has the proper amount of flexibility as a sword should If you were to get struck by this in training there wouldnt be as much damage done as a wooden bokken although you will feel it for sure especially the fingers but thats what gloves are for As a whole Im really glad I bought these They simulate actual combat very well and are very sturdy I recommend these to anybody studying Japanese martial arts 
If u r thinking about buying a boken blade or some other wood or flee market stuff just stop stop now this is what u need all that other stuff with take one hit agents a tree and be done broke a boken blade first day agents a branch but this this blade will just go and go iv killed 5 nabiorhood cats with this and permently disabled a dog this is perfect for practice were u really want to hit things  
Im 63 250 Its too small for me 
My daughter bought this and LOVES it I bought a refurbished military issue bag Comparing the two this seems to be a tad bit warmer but wont fit in my midsized internal fram backpack stuff sack either Even stuffed down snug this is relatively big But its warm Pros Warm and big enough for most men Lightweight for the price Weve not tested it in extreme cold though Works fine in our hammocks Cons A little on the bulky side 
Camped in some very very cold conditions in a tent at Scout camp by cold mountain in western north Carolina Did very well I stayed warm and so food my son his It was 8 degrees out at 2am Kinda bulky though 
Ima freeze baby when I camp and I always wake up in the middle of the night cold but this was the answer I finally got some sleep and was toasty warm in this bag Worth evey penny It is a bit bulky but for the price its very good bang for your buck 
Great storm flaps Keeps cold air out 
Great product Keeps you very warm in the coldest of weather Zippers are high quality and it fits me well for a 6 foot 1 inch man 
For car camping this will be a great bag to have doable for a backpacking although its a tad heavy 
Has lasted a long time At temps below 32F I had to wear thermals to stay warm 
This was purchased for a sibling studying the martial arts that needed items to practice with The overall quality was good and it has held up to the beatings given to it by a national competition gold medalist so thats saying something If he likes it I guess it deserves a 5 star rating 
I absolutely love this bokken I use it for sparring against other Cold Steel training swords and have never been so impressed with a product If you havent seen the videos I highly recommend you check them out the guys over at Cold Steel beat the crap out of these things The polypropylene is extremely durable and should never break crack rot splinter or corrode Bottom line spar all day and never worry about it 
Very nice and very warm 
Absolutely amazing product Warm comfortable even if weather is not extremely cold it does not make you sweat or anything Its awesome 
Jealous camp mates haha 
Nice and sturdy This will not break like a wood sword will I would recommend for contact use Worth the 25 
I was skeptical about these due to them being plastic  But I can now say they are awesome and Strong as hell My son and I have beat the crap out of eachother and every dead tree in the forest Outstanding item  
I used this for a month of cross country camping in July of 2013 This bag saw an array of weather conditions from rain to freezing temperatures in Wyoming to high winds in Kansas It held up beautifully and kept me warm and cozy I am a very cold sleeper which is why I opted for a 0 bag in July It was roomy and the zipper went easily In Wyoming the temperature dipped down one night and I was cozy and warm My only con about this bag is how tight the stuff sack is Buy yourself a big stuff sack and forget the one it comes with H 54 W 150 
Sweet deal Keeps me warm in winter sleeping in a hammock Ordered another one for my wife and she has not gotten to use it yet 
Warm and happy wife worth the 40 
I use this bag when I go backpacking Works great and is lightweight Ive been very impressed given how good of a price it was 
We used paintball masks for head protection and my brother and I went at it The tip is sharp to scratch open skin so be careful Other than that they are very sturdy and we hope to face off again and again 
Nice shape nice material I can only wish for a better packaging No damage but the item made a hole in the box 
been using it a lot from when i got it very good for practice the handle is long then normal for gloves witch is nice but if you dont use gloves its a bit weird 
I am 6 and 240 pounds and this thing has plenty of room to spare 
Ive only used it for a couple camping trips but its kept me warm 40 nights in a hammock Some loose threads inside had to be cut Might be a touch short for someone over 6 tall Getting the sleeping bag back into the sack is about a 10 minute ordeal with an extra person helping Very tricky to compress 
I have a live Katana However I like to practice with wooden Bokkens also When I saw this model I was excited to try it out The weight is similar to my real Katana though the length is a bit shorter Assembly involves putting the Tsuba onto the blade to the level of the hilt and then placing the rubber ring It is obviously dull but the point is rather sharp enough to get someones attention The feel when striking is similar to a real Katana This material is virtually indestructible For a practice sword this is as good as it gets Two thumbs up 
The bokkens came shipped in the same box end to end each new within Cold Steels plastic bags with tsuba and tsuba retainiongrings in a seperate bag but attached to the main bag The bokkens are slightly flexible as others have noted but in that they could be a LOT more durable and safer to practice with including partner drills and CONTROLLED sparring with protective gear I will be attaching kydex saber guards over the next few weeks to change these bokkens in saber waster of which there is a noticible lacksince Lynn Thompson sells so many Western Sabers hes really missing the market on this 
This will be great for practice and for defense also will go with my armor for Halloween Item was perfect fits great in back strap I bought too 
This sword is good to use against practice targets because it is very durable It is just a tad light compared to wooden equivalents but other than that I enjoy using it and it is my go to for practicing 
These things are tough they fit pretty well in the plastic saya you get from ebogu with just a little bit of stiffness initially but wear in nice for the price you cant beat it Also for safety reasons these are much better then wood bokkens Roninkancom 
Ive owned one of these for years and use it almost every day to train hitting It has held up very well but beware While it certainly takes a beating and will come back for more it is susceptible to heat I left my first one in my jeep after getting back from camping and it warped I would certainly still recommend it but be aware they have one weakness 
matches my actual sword perfect training with it has been a blast all i need now is to complete the set and ill be a happy camper 
Not the best bang for your buck but what can you expect from Coleman To be completely honest this is my first sleeping bag ever Definitely very warm and cozy My biggest gripe is that it is SO bulky It wont easily be strapped to a backpack I used para cord straps will probably work better I also had the most insanely hard time of trying to roll the sleeping bag tight enough to get it back into the provided bag Im a 30 year old male in excellent physical shape and I swear even the Hulk would have had a hard time Overall it took me 40 minutes of struggling to get it into the bag Excellent buy for the budget conscious buyer or somebody who plans to use it every once in a blue moon Not the best buy for avid hikers campers outdoorsmen Too much of a hassle to get into bag too bulky for long treks in the woods 
Bought this for my daughter who was traveling to North Dakota in January by car Being short of money she opted to sleep in her car rather than get a hotel each night She pulled over to rest areas and slept in this She said no matter how cold it was outside she was cozy warm 
VERY warm zipper seems well built my only gripe is the bag is overly tight and I am only 56 would be challenging to zip it up wearing winter clothing Dont try to use it above 50 degrees it will cook you A little bulky have to compression wrap it to fit it on my backpack but I think any good 0 degree bag would be like that Overall happy with my purchase but not a perfect product 
if you can break it i want to know how great weight and balance i will be buying more cold steel training weapons 
Used it a number of times outside once being in sub temps just after a snow storm Very very comfy decent amount of room in this This is a very tall bag as I normally change out of my boots into slippers for sleep and put my boots at the very bottom of the bad so they are not frozen in the morning it works very well Great great product 
Received today opened and climbed in to check out Im 510 150 lb and it fit me just right It is a wellconstructed welldesigned mummy bag As long as it keeps me warm while camping or surviving somewhere Ill be very happy All indications are that it will be fine 
swell 
Very good protection My scout kid loved it for the outing he took 
At 60 and 350 lbs Im a bit too rotund to fit into this mummy bag Not a big deal my 58 150lbs wife fits in it snuggly and warmly We overnighted in 36 degree early March Colorado Rockies and she was more than comfortable Good luck ever getting it rolled up small enough to fit back into the stuff sack it came with We surely didnt have any luck with it Not a big deal however a bag this bulky and heavy deserves its own tote 
So I bought this for someone as gift for their training  and they absolutely love it  its VERY sturdy  and it gives quite a licking for being a training sword  
Except that it FEELS like its a cheap plastic toy its the best practice bokken Ive ever used By now four wooden bokkens wouldve been broken but this one is still going strong 
This thing is super durable and very well balanced Tsuba comes unattached so you can leave it or put it on Definitely buy this if you dot want to have to replace your bokken right away 
I already had this bag and ordered another one for my son since the price was almost half of what I paid I have used this in tents in low temps 2030F and its pretty warm 
Used it for one snow caving trip with the scouts Probably got down to 1015 degrees at night and as long as I had proper layers on I was warm enough Quality seems pretty good but this is a large bag Good for car camping but I would not want to hike with it This was not my purpose since I mainly just wanted to be warm 
Took this on a huntingcamping trip One night the temperature plunged to around 22 degrees Fahrenheit It barely kept me warm however Im kinda skinny and get cold easily when Im not moving I was wearing pants a winter hat and a sweatshirt while fully enclosed in the bag 
I do like this sleeping bag but Im going to return mine I got mine the other day I just got into it to try it out  Its to narrow for me to be comfortable Im 63  290 lbs so its to narrow for sure As for tall people Id say 6 feet is the max for a guy or gal to be comfortable in this sleeping bag Also if one were to be slender that would be a must for this bag Overallif you are over 6 feet tall and large this sleeping bag is not the one for you in my opinion I have no comment regarding the temperature range of this bag since I tried it out in my living room 
LOVE LOVE LOVE this bag Im 61 and its very comfy  roomy Bought it to take on motorcycle camping trips packs great back into the included stuff bag and the colors are good Best bag Ive ever had 
Cheap and fairly warm on and bulky as hell but for its purpose you already knew that right 
I love cold steel all of their weapons are well made and reasonably priced This bokken is no exception its solidly constructed not too heavy but also has some weight behind it and a good shape No complaints from me 
This item is very durable but protect the hands of accessories is not suitable and it will bend if bending the need to use hand adjustment 
Ive been using my Cold Steel Bokken for over three years now sparring with friends and breaking sticks and its still in great condition PROS  very durable will easily outlast 10 wooden bokken will not rot or break  performs well as a blunt defensive weapon  at a low cost and virtually zero maintenance this thing is fun exercise CONS  may warp if left under stress proper storage is key to prevent warping I recommend using a sword rack or the corner of a room to rest it vertically  the handle is lightly textured but sweaty hands may lose grip I recommend using gloves or wrapping your handle with grip tape This product deserves 55 stars 
As a student and instructor of Kenjutsu and Wakizashijutsu I have had the pleasure of using numerous types of training models both wood and plastic This Cold Steel Bokken is one of the best on the market for the price I found it to be well balanced and durable The weight feels close to the same as with a real Katana and Wakizashi I have used this model for many years while teaching my Kenjutsu and Wakizashijutsu classes in the past and found them to be excellent training weapons If you are serious about training in the Japanese sword arts you cannot go wrong purchasing this Cold Steel sword model Rating 5 Stars Joseph J Truncale Author WakizashiJutsu Official manual for Bushi Satori Ryu 
Pretty cool product Its very well made and very sturdy Although it cant cut you getting hit by it kind of hurts 
This bokken is an excellent qualitydid not regret in paying the price tagas always cold steel deliver their quality product with excellence I highly recommend this to anyone interested 
It was too big It wouldnt fit to my backpack even after using compress stuff bags 
Awesome bag There are people that say that it is too heavy for hiking I did some research and found that for the cold weather rating that this bag has it is in the same weight range as those that cost twice as much I am a larger guy some have mistaken me for being big foot while hiking This bag is large enough to for my 62 frame to fit in nicely 
As described very high quality indeed 
Product used 0 to 3 C early winter in Nepal for trek Coming from Singapore hot weather with young kids travelling with us we needed something to keep VERY warm Its freezing cold and we used it with sweaters woolen socks and sometimes even gloves on Kept us warm much better than normal sleeping bags also bought in Amazon We also got Teton XXL sleeping bag for this trip I was totally shocked of its bulkiness May be great for camps when you travel with own vehicle For 4 of us we took 2 normal sleeping bags 1 coleman and 1 teton XXL and I must say Coleman Sleeping bag size would be almost equal to those 2 normal sleeping bags And slightly bigger than Teton XXL 3 Stars for its bulkiness and not suitable for a trek wo porter But kept warm much better 
I used this sleeping bag for a camping trip to Yosemite National Park during the beginning of November Temperatures at night dipped just below freezing This bag is rated at 0 degrees This doesnt mean youll be cozy and warm in 0 degree weather but that youll be warm enough to stay alive As a person who thinks it is cold when its 65 degrees out I still felt a little cold in this sleeping bag but I was less cold than previous trips in my old sleeping bag Overall this sleeping bag feels well made and durable The zipper closure was strong and didnt snag on the bag It should last many years of use It was not hard to stuff back into stuff sack Not easy not hard but doable with some effort I did not roll it I simply stuffed it back in Others have mentioned that they had difficulty with it but I had no problem with it as an average strength woman 
I practice Kenjutsu and Battojutsu this bokken kodashi or tanto from coldsteel are the real deal light strong and flexible I know that only a few out there are going to understand this but it really cuts I have cut through plastic wood and by accident I made a cut to kote in a practice So if you practice hard its great also I have some students that are begginers they also love this because when they hit wrong it doesnt get broken like wood ones will do Buy them theyre great 
I was going to buy a wooden bokken as a practice sword but I noticed this Cold Steel Bokken was only a little bit more  Im very glad I spent the extra cash The sword is constructed of a very strong polycarbonate plastic that is very tough You could spar with this sword and it will last a very long time even if you are very aggressive I took a few whacks with it at various things and there isnt a single dent on it The only downside to this sword is the very slight flex when hitting something compared to a wooden sword The flex will be unnoticeable unless you are focusing on it and you will not notice it if you are engaged For people purchasing this sword for personal nonprofessional or nonsporting use I just want to warn you how dangerous even this plastic sword is There are videos on youtube where people use this sword to easily crush watermelons and break wooden crates Also make sure you know the laws in your state or country if outside the US regarding carrying these publicly in some states it isnt legal to carry one of these outside even in plain sight You could be arrested Finally I would like to add that I will most likely be keeping this sword but I will also purchase an O Bokken which is only a few inches larger but it is over 50 heavier This bokken is great for people under 6 feet but the O Bokken might be more appropriate if you are taller or want to get stronger 
Ordered this after breaking a couple of different wooden bokken Great feel to this in terms of weight the handle is longer than I was used to but quickly learned to appreciate that fact 
I previously had some wooden Bokkens that did not last very long at all They both broke within about 3 months of being used This thing is awesome and takes hits like a champ I will most likely be back to buy another one 
I am in no way an experienced swordsman but I feel that this bokken is great It is considerably lighter than an actual katana but I think most bokkens are that way It is very impact resistant to the point of being almost indestructible Once I accidentally hit a support beampillar with full force dont ask  and I found no trace of damage on the bokken The only flaw I see is that polypropylene is not as dense as wood so the bokken is easily damaged by sharp objects and can be cut by bladed weapons This is not really an issue unless you decide to channel musashi and fight a katana with a bokken 
really good bag  and great price 
I got two of these for my sons for scout camping I love it that I even plan to get another to upgrade my old sleeping bag for me It is a great buy 
This is a great cold weather sleeping bag for a great price but I bought this for backpacking use meaning camping  hiking while carrying everything with me and it is way too big for that I tested it inside my house when it first arrived and soon got very hot inside the bag This would be a good sleeping bag for car camping where you dont have to worry about keeping gear size  weight to a minimum 
I take this out when I walk around my neighborhood early in the morning I only walk for a mile or a mile and a half but while Im doing the walk I practice assorted kendo moves So I get a walk and a swordfighting workout of a sort every morning And it works just fine with this 
Like 
This does not make a good mummy costume 110 would not recommend for that purpose but for a sleeping bag it is extra warm 
The bag itself is awesome Keeps me plenty warm everywhere I have taken it The zipper howeverI have no idea how I managed it but the zipper broke the first week I owned it I cant seem to fix it  it popped out of the protective plastic coverSeems impossible to get back in If the zipper actually worked on mine I would easily give this a 55 
I am very pleased with the quality of this training bokken Good weight excellent tsuba that fits quite tightly Takes and gives a strike with ease I much prefer it to the wooden ones I have 
So far this has been my favorite practice sword I just bought my second one They are incredibly durable and though they may get gashes from heavy abuse they maintain their shape and show no signs of cracking or potential breakage Ive gone through 4 wooden bokken in the time that my first one has lasted I only recommend putting some form of additional grip on the swords handle to add comfort and prevent sweat from making it slippery Great product and recommended to all martial arts enthusiasts 
My boys love it 
I bought this sleeping bag knowing it was too heavy for backpacking thinking it would be worth the extra weight just so I wouldnt be cold during winter camping trips I was wrong First off this bag is enormous Compression sacks do very little for this You WILL have to strap it to the outside of your bag unless you have a milsurp large ALICE bag in which case it will fill over half of the storage space I estimate it takes up 30L of space in its stuff sack Second off this bag is heavy Its heavier than my tent heavier than my backpack Its actually the heaviest thing in my pack Thats somewhat to be expected as a cheap zerodegree bag but lets observe that This is not a zerodegree bag I took it on several camping trips with a low of 32F It is only comfortable if youre fully dressed multiple layers jacket two pairs of socks and a beanie This last trip I went without the jacket and only wore one pair of thick wool socks and was miserably cold all night Note that this was 32F and had the aid of a thermal reflecting sleeping pad The description boasts comfort down to 15F Id argue probable survival at those temps but not a cozy night I was prepared to make some sacrifices in weight to save money and still be warm but in the end I was disappointed in all regards I would rate 1 star but I must admit that it is warmer than my 40F Summer bag and at least on this last trip I didnt die or lose extremities to frostbite I would return this but Ive had it too long and gotten it dirty Be prepared to splurge on your sleeping bag or you will spend the night shivering or worse 
Excellent sleeping bag 
Great product 
Tested in 23 degree weather this weekend Love it If using for smaller kids make sure to put clothingetc in it to take up the extra space 
very very nice 
This is great at keeping me warm in 020 degree weather But keep in mind that its extremely difficult to compress to fit in your bag I had to use a compression stuff sack to be able to also fit 4 freezedry packs 1 small pot and a lightweight pillow in my 45L bag and even that was pushing it 
very warm and not to bad to repack 
Seems to work pretty well I used this to sleep in my car  when I woke up it was 15 degrees F and it seemed to do its job 
Great heavy duty bag for winter I used it a while back and it got down to the teens and I stayed warm 
its bulky but very warm i returned it and got a more lightweight one 
Very nice quality Havent slept outside yet Inside camping or my boys left them sleeping on top of them since they are so warm 
I got this bag on sale and absolutely love it It kept me very warm in low 30 temps and I slept like a baby I would have paid full price for this with no complaints Only downside is it is very big when rolled up and inside the stuff sack It will not fit it my 75 liter backpack sleeping back compartment Anyone looking to use this bag to hike in and camp will most likely have to carry it in by hand Hard to beat for the price though 
Camped in 28 degree weather was warm enough to pull the zipper down haha Very comfortable Dont spend 23X on some other OnBrand bag Woke up to snow in the boundary waters 
Great sleeping bag and incredible price Definitely keeps one warm in cold weather Very pleased with purchase 
Pretty tight fit if you have a beer belly And by my age a lot of people have beer bellys At 511 and 265 lbs I can get it zipped and it works great very warm but it feels like youve been stuffed into a sausage casing  I could use a little more room and an interior pocket would be nice too 
Slept in the snow in this didnt shiver once 
Great Quality a bit bulky  not really for hiking  too huge 
Got a steal at this price Add an emergency blanket with a sleeping bag liner for added warmth Too heavy for backpacking 
I slept in 15F weather in this bag I was freezing all night but I didnt die so that is a plus I was also in a tiny pup tent which offered no warmth or protection and I was in the open wind The fact that I could actually fall asleep in 15 weather is impressive This bag is a very solid sleeping bag The bag is rated for 0 and I believe that dressed properly and with a properly set up camp this sleeping bag will keep you nice and warm It compresses very small which is great for transport and storage I would definitely buy more of these if I had the need 
Great deal 
excellent in every way  no complaints for what it is used for it is big  fat  bulky but it is for my camper so it is perfect 
Its really warm Im not really a fan of mummy bags though I feel claustrophobic in it I need to find a standard bag that is this warm 
This is a very cozy bag I wouldnt quite call it a zero degree bag I put it to the test on a week kayaking trip in Alaska during September The weather got down to about 20 degrees and I woke up freezing It was mostly my feet However I will say that it rained the entire time so that could of added to why I was so cold The bag is VERY LARGE too I would not be able to take it on a extensive hiking trip It barley fit in my kayak with my other gear I do love it for car camping or other simple outdoor activities I would call it a threeseason bag 
this bag did what you want I was warm and slept comfortably at 15 degrees F Like most mummy bags it not easy to move around and this is no exception Its a bit bulky but no larger than my military sleep system was and this was lighter I would still recommend a serious sleep pad as it is not rigid at all so there will be heat loss and discomfort if directly on the ground It stayed dry from the snow and the open face was large enough to get air but wasnt so open as to let snow in The storage bag was not a compression bag so I had to get one from the local outdoor store so loss one star for that 
The price was great and I used it this past weekend at the camp The temp only got down to 40 degrees but I was nice and comfortable 
I froze at 32 degrees Its an nice bag feels really decent quality and a great price But I have a Rei half dome tent with 2 full foam mats and my body got so cold from the top I had 3 layers on and a jacket wool socks with thermals on to My toes almost froze literally i woke up to find my toes almost frost bitten It was only 32 Not the best bag 
on time as promised cant wait to use it out on the trail 
The only reason it gets a two is because the details like zipper strings hood draft collar are not too bad but the rating is way off At 50 nude you will be cold That is the best way to rate a bag That way if it gets colder then you expected and it always does as in wind you will not freeze With long underwear and heavy socks you can make 40 But that is not the bag that is extra clothes The feet area have less than half an inch of insulation the rest of the bag is lucky to have 2 I am no stranger to winter camping If you want to be warm at 0 you need at least 6 inches of insulation extra clothes and no wind what that means is you better have 3 times the insulation that this bag has If you try this bag at 0 you will probably die This bag is also a little on the small side I am not that big This bag would be good in the summer time at not too high an elevation 
I used this bag two different weekends camping in November 2015 Both times the temperature dropped down to 25 F The first weekend I was comfortable once my body heat filled the bag I woke up a couple of times during the night feeling cold but this was the first time cold weather camping My socks could have been wet The second weekend I figured out how to pull up the draw string to keep only my eyes visible I wore thicker socks and I felt much warmer that night This bag is perfect for the camping I do with the Boy Scouts Im able to bring it down in the car and not worry about carrying it far to camp This bag might not be what you are looking for if you backpack It might be too thick and heavy to carry or strap to your pack You will have to judge that for yourself Also I find it hard to roll up and store in the bag they provide I always get it but it take me some time to get it started I bought one of these for my son and he also likes it I think this mummy bag is perfect for the price Some cold rated mummy bags can be very pricey but this one is affordable 
I bought this bag from Amazon recently for an upcoming backpacking trip in the Appalachians in anticipation of cold weather It fit in my backpack with some difficulty and yes its weight does not make it an ideal sleeping bag for backpacking however I was so pleasantly surprised at how warm this bag kept me Two nights of temperatures in the upper 20s proved to me this is the sleeping bag I will be bringing with me for any season but summer I had an inflatable mattress below me which only added to the comfort and warmth I am not a young person so keeping warm is a greater challenge for me and I was very pleased with this purchase PROS hood keeps your head warm Chest baffle holds in heat Foot area not too confining Warmest sleeping bag Ive ever ownedwell worth the extra space and weight CONS zipper does not bind up but very difficult to get zipped up Takes some effort to get back into stuff sack A little more confining than a standard bag but still adequate for me 5 8 tall 250 lbs broad shouldered 
nice sleeping bag 
Perfect  
Much bigger than I expected takes up a lot of space even when rolled up Very toasty though should keep you warm throughout cold nights 
Awesome sleeping bag Love how it covers all but your face No freezing air can sneak in It came with a nice bag that I can easily tie down to the bottom of my hiking backpack Not heavy at all can barely feel the weight on my back Was surprised I could roll it back up and fit into the bag At a price under 40 you cant beat it 
Ive only used this once in the cold so far it was quite warm The temperature got down to just below 30F when I was hammock camping and I was warm all night even with a moderate wind I did have thermal pants and shirt along with a sleeping pad to also keep me warm This bag is thick with a lot of fill 60oz which makes it warm and comfortable The only downside to almost 4lb of fill is that the bag weights 5lb but the only other bags with a comparable temperature rating that weight less are usually around 3lb and cost 510 times as much For this price point youre not getting a better temp rating and while you might get a slightly lighter bag the only ones ive seen are around 4050F 
Excellent 
I wish I had more room in the feet area Other than that it will keep me warm 
So far I like these We havent actually used them yet but they look and feel like they are going to be very warm I bought these for my kids They are for adults but I bought them that way so they can grow into them 
I havent tried in a cold outside yet but its well made and good quality However there are two downsides First the cover is too tight so its not easy to fold and put it in a cover The cover should be larger Its two peoples job Second the sleeping bag is kind of small for big guy Im 511 and weigh 175 lb but I feel tight inside the sleeping bag If you are bigger than me it might be too tight for you I gave it to my wife since she is small and much better fit 
One of the best sleeping bags I have ever used Cinches tight doesnt slip off and holds heat exactly as it should Stuffs and stores well with a bit of effort and is an excellent emergency preparedness item for cold weather regions 
I have tried several mummy bags and had to return this one While I liked the quality of it it was simply just a bit snug for me I am 6 foot and 180 pounds and I like to have a bit more movement than this bag provides Nothing bad to say about this bag except too snug for me For example I sometimes cross my legs like the number 4 and this bag was too snug to do that I hope this helps someone 
Warm and roomy enough I recommend 
Its a well made bag but the taper from the knees on down was too tight for me I felt too bound up for a good night sleep Im 6 tall and the length was good 
This bag is better quality than I expected but keep in mind that at the time of this review I have not tried the bag in below freezing weather What surprised me though is that this bag seemed as good of quality as the rectangular Grizzly 30 degree bags that I paid over 100 for It has good loft a great antisnag zipper and extra Velcro closures and synch straps for the extremely cold nights The material seems tough I expect these to last a long time and be warm enough for anything except winter camping Im sure like every other sleeping bag rating the 30 just means you wont get hyperthermia it doesnt mean youll be toasty warm at 30 I expect that youd still be comfortable in this bag if it was just below freezing if you had a proper insulating sleeping mat I wish this bag came with an oversized stuff sack with compression straps so you could store it loose and then synch it up tight before you go camping But its just a regular stuff sack So if you care about the loft of the bag youll have to store it outside of the stuff sack All in all this bag is well worth the 50 I paid for it 
Great product for its price 
The bag itself seems to be of the quality that I would expect from Coleman The reason I am giving it 4 stars is that it is way to tight on the shoulder area I am 61 and 200 lbs and consider myself average sized the height of this bag fit perfectly but when I got it zipped up my legs were fine very comfortable but it was very tight on my shoulders I was not able to roll over with out the bag rolling with me This is now my wifes bag and I am again looking for one that fits me 
great fit plenty of room for 54 170 lb me Please note  this is VERY HOT in normal weather will need to try it in real conditions 
My wife is always cold and hated camping until I gave her this sleeping bag We camped for 20 nights this summer 5 of which were in the middle of BC Canada and she was as cozy as could be 
great 
Trust me this is so worse it I slept on this thing to cross the country and it never fail me once 
I loved everything about this bag but the zipper at the foot on the sides is a stupid design Ive never seen one like it always having to put it back together not because it broke but because it just comes apart not while your in it but when your first zipping it up you will see the design is just not that goodAnd it also snags alotbut nothing to bad you cant fix real quick in saying that this bag is warm as hell literally I work in the oil field and it was 22 degrees this winter and I sleep in my big rig at night with no heater because I cant sleep in hot air But I tell you what I stayed warm as a fat man in a big o bag could be I also weight in at 247 and 62 its all around great and for the price You cant get any better then this And at one time my wife came and stayed the night and we both fit in it also not comfortable mind you but we fit and shes not a skinny girl Im happy with this buy and like I said Im buying one more asap 
This sleeping bag has kept me warm several nights of camping now I got the 0 degree because I wanted to make sure I wouldnt get cold and I have not been I like that it is long so I could stuff a small blanket in the feet if needed So far I have not 
Took this on a trip to Tibet Mt Kailash last month and worked beautifully in keeping me warm in freezing weather Was a little difficult to pack back in its case but still worth the hassle Very high quality zippers and fabric Donated to my guide after the trip needless to say he had a big smile on his face  
Its a warm bag Doesnt stuff well into the bottom of a pack Needs extra straps to secure to back pack 
Not a 0 bag but definitely keeps you warm with an under layer of Mylar At 30 
wife used it this weekend camping was very comfortable and seems like a good product 
This is a great sleeping bag I took it camping and I was happy I did The temperature reached the low twenties yet I was nice and toasty inside While all my friends were all shivering and barely slept I slept like a baby Its a bit heavy for a hiking trip but for the price I paid its worth it 
Warm and comfortable Shape provides more room Great buy for the price 
Im 6 tall and built so its a tight fit and I cant quite zip up all the way inside of it My son can and stays toasty warm Overall Im pleased with the purchase of two of these bags and as long as I wear layers on top and a skull cap I can sleep comfortably in this bag on winter camp outs 
It was exactly what I expected from a 40 sleeping bag No where near 0Deg bag but thick and comfortable for car camping or river trips This is my Car camping bag since its so puffy and helps add padding up me compared to my down sleeping bag What more can you expect from a bag a t that price with prime shipping 
I brought this bag with me to Yosemite for a recent trip where we were staying in Housekeeping camp and the temperature got down into the 30s at night It is a great sleeping bag for carcamping  but definitely not something you want for a backpacking trip It is far to bulky to carry around effectively However for my uses it was perfect Kept me nice and warm but not sweaty I got some of the best sleep of my life in this thing 
Quality sleeping bag 
Not a great backpacking bag but its super warm and comfortable I keep it in my car for emergencies 
Wouldnt recommend this for backpackers as its quite heavy but this sleeping bag is WARM Great for camping in low temps Very happy with it so far 
So warm The sleeping bag will be perfect for me Not too big but not too small Not too loose and not too tight It was so warm for those cold camping nights 
Very warm I had a Suisse Sport Zero Degree sleeping bag that wouldnt keep me warm in 20 degree F weather I decided to buy Coleman because they are a trusted brand This sleeping bag keeps me very warm I can sleep comfortably because it keeps me warm and I dont have to wear a bunch of layers to sleep I usually sleep without a shirt  pants in this bag 
The quality of the bag is very good Draft tube running the length of the zipper and also drawstring draft tube around the chestshoulder area Drawstring also for the face and a large foot box area adds to the comfort The insulation is noticeably thicker than the other 3040 degree bags that I have It comes with a stuff sack I am 6  1 and 205 lbs and this fits with room to spare 
These bags are nice but NOT suitable for 0 degree weather We used these and temps dipped into the high 20s and we were miserable It may keep you alive in 0 degrees but you will be freezing I wouldnt recommend these for use below 40 degrees at the lowest 
Great product easy to pack and carry 
They seem to be high quality considering the price 
I took this on a trip Last April it got down to about 3540 where I was at and I literally felt as if I was sleeping with no bag at all I normally dont get cold and I was FREEZING it was literally as if I was just sleeping bare I had to layer twice and I still was shivering Think twice before you take this bag into anything but 60 or higher at night 
Good for a colman 
BUT TOO BIG AND HEAVY DOES NOT FIT BACK IN BACKWEIRD 
I ordered two for my wife and myself They Arrived on time in retail packaging They both came with a stuff sack The price is deceiving because these are amazing sleeping bags They wont help much in the Arctic but for Michigan they are ideal 
This bag helped to keep me warm while winter camping The temperature was between 5 and 10 degrees Fahrenheit There was already snow on the ground and three inches arrived overnight I had a thermorest Ground pad and wore light clothing I was snug and warm the entire night That is why I give 5 stars I would give a negative that the bad feels tight so if you need room to movekeep looking But for the price warmth and comfort this is a great bag 
WARM Girlfriend stayed nice and toasty in super cold weather the only thing that was a pin was the stuff sack there were no clips to hitch it to a back pack that being said this bag is huge so it took up a lot of space inside my pack 
After several uses I give this Bag an A 
Took it out on my winter FTX and the temp was around 17 degrees over night I was too warm and had to open the door of my tent Very high quality bag 
this is the best sleeping bag you can buy for this price I didnt expect much when I ordered it but this is a much higher quality bag than I expected 
Pretty sweet bag and plenty thick Bottom zip option for warmer nights is great to have Price was right so I bought 2 Stuff sack could be a tad larger but not a big issue Cram the large end in first 
I took it to one night camping and it was warm during that night so I do not know how well it will be during cold night it was ok except it is a little bit hard to pack into its bag 
Bought for my oldest Grandson He loves it 
Good bag for general use Would no recommend for back country backpacking 
Great bag nothing beats the price and quality of this one worth its weight in gold too 
nice and warm and comfortable 
Got the bag for my son he loves it hard time getting him out of it on cold mornings 
We have two of these Coleman North Rim 0Degree Mummy Bags and have used them on numerous trips to the Northern Sierra Nevada and Utah camping trips Prior to using these I have gone through half a dozen others in my life time I think this is one of the best values in sleeping bags out there bar none It absolutely keeps us warm even in fall and winter inside a tent Yes in the camping world of gadgets  the lighter an item is it is disproportionately expensive This sleeping bag is much heftier than very high end ones that are equally warm yet super light But there is an added benefit many look over and that is the heftier a sleeping bag the less of a need for a sleeping pad you have as the bulk and heft will essentially act as a sleeping pad for you In other words this bag is a winner for the vast majority of campers who are casual campers in America myself included Recommended 
Good sleeping bag Very warm 
Used it on one backpacking trip and all was fine On second trip the zipper broke and now it is trash in my garage Do not buy this 
felt to closterfobic 
This is a pretty dang high quality bag for the money Wow Im impressed 
This was a good deal and fast 
This is the third of this bag that we have purchased for kids in our family The bag has proven warm enough for basic car camping and most backpacking It is quite heavy and is VERY bulky It is very difficult to even fit it back into its original stuff sack but kids age 10 and up have figured it out On cold nights we throw on an extra blanket but it is usually kicked off by morning 12 year old son has used it for short overnight backpacks but for anything longer I would say this adds too much weight and bulk to a pack We have had several of these for many years and been very happy with their durability Zippers work great and stuff sacks have held up well 
10F killed it Im 60 215lbs and had PLENTY of room in the bag Very big fan and cant find another bag that can compete at this price Ive even ditched my REI bag for this 
Kept me warm on smokie mountains in a snow storm Great product 
Great bag September 20 2011 was when I first ordered it for a cross country trip Had it ever since and have been camping and to festivals with it No need to use anything else when this one works so good I sleep in it in my Yukon Outfitters Double Wide hammock I got from sportwootcomthey go for sale for 20 time to time and are the same as eno I currently have my hammock hung up in my bedroom for every night sleeping and I lay in this bag in the hammock every night Great thing about this sleeping bag is it keeps you warm so well and if you wake up and the sun is out and its hot the outside reflects sunlight so you stay cool inside 
Great bag for the money Used on a two day campout with temps down to about 20 degrees and stayed very comfortable 
Kept me very warm on a 30 degree night A little cold air came in around my shoulder but I did not cinch everything tight as I should have There is velcro around the neck to keep it snug Havent tested it in colder weather Zipper doesnt snag from the inside Its bulky and heavy but very good mix for the price and warmth 
WAY to big and weighty to take backpacking would be good for a car though 
Kids stayed warm and cozy all night Kids had plenty of room to move around in these bags 
The compression sack is cool but it still doesnt get a small as Id like Also its a little heavier than Id like It would keep me warm but I think I need one a size bigger cause I cant cinch it closed around my head without bending at the knees or something 
Did not keep my feet warm at twenty degrees with no wind 
The first night the temp dropped to 20 and all was toasty in the bag The second night I added a fleece liner the low was 3 and the bag was great Im ordering another one 
Super warm Its a human cocoon 
Spent a night in this in Kansas when it was 8 and the Rocky mountains during a snowstorm I was warm all night 
Kept me warm in my most recent camping trip 
Amazon claims it to be 35 pounds which would have been too good to be true so I guess I shouldnt have believed it It was 5 I returned it Its also massive 
It kept me warm and dry but I felt like I was suffocating all night Unless you sleep flat on your back or stomach dont get the mummy bag You cant curl up you cant roll over and you cant really move at all Sure its warm and dry but I was very uncomfortable all night 
As a BSA Assistant Scout Master I camp monthly 10 months a year My Coleman bag goes with me from low teens to mid summer heat and never lets me down 
nice 
Nice bag and warm Just a little tight across the shoulders I am 64 and it is a little short for me Not for x country A little bulky and difficult to stuff in the sack provided 
Have officially tried it below freezing It got to 30 F this past weekend I stayed toasty  even sweated a little I wore thin long underwear tshirt thin pullover and no socks Bag performed so well I had to occasionally zip if open to stop sweating Note I did use a Thermarest NeoAir Xtherm insulated air mattress which definitely helped The bag is a huge improvement from my old coleman rectangular bags with flannel which seem to take up 2 bushel baskets of space I am 5 10 and 215lbs I slept well even though I rotate from from to side to back to other side like a hot dog on a convenience store roller I would not say plenty of space but I would say I comfortably fit with enough room to move like I do This is the first product that I learned to STUFF into its stuff sack I had up to this point been a roll it up tight kind of guy New method for sure but people need to know a stuff sack is just that It does fit in the bag that it comes with NOTE this bag is still too big for backpacking but a great performing bag for the money if your campsite is within walking distance from your vehicle and you are camping in freezing weather 
Great bag for great price camped 1 week in mountainsbelow freezing temps works well Does not roll up small for hikingbackpacking though 
Great bag 
Item shipped fast and looks like what I need for my next camping trip Will update after using 
Purchased for my Boy Scout Works great especially on cold nights 
0 degree is survivable temperature  Used this bag at 10F with long underwear and was comfortable but not toasty For the price Id buy it again 
I purchased two Coleman mummy bags for my boys Scout camping trips I trusted the Coleman brand and these bags seemed right for the price They kept the boys warm and dry all year round During the winter months yes Boy Scouts camp out during the winter too I took them off the ground and had them sleep on a cot inside their tent The bags worked well even in the low teens and snow The only complaint I had with these bags was their compressibility Because of their materials and thickness they do not compress well Many times I found them sticking halfout of a compression sack after a campout But once home they can be rolled out and properly rolled back into the sack My opinion if you want an affordable durable sleeping bag for camping this is a good choice 
Too bulky but otherwise reasonably priced 
used it at church camp AWSOME 
I had to return this because it was too big for my backpacking needs but it seemed pretty nice for a normal camping trip Pros Quality and comfort Cons Too bulky for backpacking 
This thing becomes an oven of pure awesomeness when its a bit chilly outside 
Returned because it was too warm for what we needed and too tight at the feet for my clausterphobic wife 
I have used this sleeping in 20 degree weather and woke up cold in the middle of the night do to insufficient insulation I would not recommend using this sleeping bag in less than 30 degrees The inside consists of a very comfortable material It has a nice hood that can easily be adjusted with a drawcord to regulate more warmth I have had it for 6 months and recently used it again in 35 degree weather and was very warm It is still a good sleeping but I must use another one in frigid weather 
Yes this sleeping bag is large But its so awesome Im probably going to get a second one Seriously this thing just does great in the cold and its fairly cheap 
Good bag but the outer cover ripped on the first night and Ive no idea why  I couldnt find anything sharp or pointy in the vicinity Im not sure about the rating on it I was out below freezing but nowhere near zero and none too warm But for the price it meets my needs acceptably 
I just started going camping a couple of months ago and in that time have gone through many sleeping bags This bag has by far been the most comfortable and easiest to put away Many of the other bags were nice but it took 20 minutes to roll up and fit in the tiny compression bag that comes with the bag This bag rolls up small and is very easy to put away I have not used it in very low temperature the lowest I would say it has been is about 30 but i have never felt cold at any point I would say it it is a great bag if you are doing car camping but I would not suggest it if you are going to do any backpacking While it does roll up small i dont think it is small enough to bring on a hike with you 
Used on campout in 15 degree overnight outside temperature Stayed warm  no shivers like Im used to getting with my old bag Happy happy 
nice and warm small or what I need because it is easy to pack nice color and will cover my all body 
Had this bag during 0 degree temp and with wind gust of 55 mph and all of this at 6000 elevation My only complaint is the size of this bad boy It eats up a lot of space I highly recommend getting a compression sack to stuff this puppy in to save some space especially If you plan on carrying it with you for hiking 
Its unfortunate that older men have to go with the scouts and sleep in the snow and I HATE the cold This bag made it nice has a padded area with a cord around the neck and another for the face I did feel like I was suffocating and woke up twice in the night for that but due to excessive body heat during a 15 deg F night my bag was not fully zipped up and I was warm 
Very warm and comfortable I should have gone with a standard style as I like to move my legs a lot when I sleep Other then that I highly recommend it 
This sleeping bag keeps you really warm I wash it in an oversized top loading washer and dryer The only negative is that it is relatively bulky to transport 
Theyre not kidding about this being a 0degree bag  I found myself sweating when I used it inside a chilly cabin and had to leave it unzipped I imagine reviewers who were too cold didnt have mats  it doesnt matter how good a sleeping bag is if you flatten all of the insulation between you and the ground and you can get a good mat for not much money Im about 63 or 64 and fit just fine though I tend to sprawl out while sleeping and there isnt much room for that in a mummystyle bag I wasnt about to spend the extra scratch on one of those specially designed bags for side sleepers I didnt find it terribly difficult to stuff into the included stuff sack and managed to get it all back in the sack on the first try Allinall its a solid product and I am happy with it 
You know it can be hard to find something just right for a 13 yr old boy but when we gave him this sleeping bag for his scouting trips he was truly overjoyeda homerun for the grandparents 
The bag in really small and a pain to repack but so worth the buy No chemical smell present which was mentioned in previous reviews 
i would not use this for hiking but for those winter fishing trips this is great to have in the car and call it a night Stayed warm in it and woke up the next morning comfortable 
But its tight I am 58 165 lbs and it was snug as a bug in a rug Bought one for my son also who is 10 and 75 lbs we stayed cozy at 30 degree weather Wont ever test it at 0 n thanks but A sure I could have gone down into the 20s with o problem If you are a larger person you willow need to look for a different bag Just sayin 
Im not a camper so I cant compare to much out there but I wish I had the regular rectangular one because I couldnt open unzip this one to attach to my boyfriends  like people do to connect the rectangular shaped sleeping bags If you dont ever want to connect two bags then this is definitely warm and snug but not easy to roll into a smalltight bag to carry It also didnt have a tie On the end to tie it closed once rolled so that irritated me and I had to use a belt I would not buy again for these reasons but giving it a 4 star for warmth and quality 
I guess this is good I bought it for my son to keep in his car He lives high in the mountains and I am always afraid about something happening in his car Now hell have this with him Does a mommy ever stop worrying about her boy 
Other reviewers who crawl into a sleeping bag when the temp is below freezing with no clothes on are asking for trouble This bag is warm and a good fit for car camping or something that doesnt require you to lug it around it is pretty heavy Bundle up if you need to If you camp bring extra layers that is the key We bring a lighter 40 degree back which essentially a bivy sack and another larger Wenger just in case If worse comes to worse we can layer the bags The price is right on this bag the quality is good and it is warm I tested with 25 degree weather and it worked I could feel some air getting in through zippers but I just used the bivy bag inside this one You are not going to find a true 0 degree bag for this price figure on spending close to 150 or more for a proper down 0 degree bag 
perfect My daughter loves itcomfortable and warm Great price point for a quality sleeping bag It should last for yearsnice color as well 
Very durable and very warm In warmer type weather my son slept on top of the sleeping bag because it was just too warm On the end of the spectrum in the cold weather this did its job The bag it came in is so small that it takes forever to get it inside thats why I purchased a larger storage bag so much easier 
I didnt open it for it is a Christmas gift for my grandson so he can go camping with the Boy Scouts in the cold and stay dry 
Havent used it yet but like the way it came and the stuff sak From the rating 0 degree this is more than I am going to need at least I dont plan on camping in that cold of weather Its light and easy to take with on any trip Comfortable and well made and am pleased with the purchase 
Bought this sleeping bag for myself This is manufactured by the best Coleman It is big enough for a big man keeps you warm and the quality is unmatched All of this for an unbelievable price 
This was perfect for two overnights in a snow cave While the stuff sack isnt great I prefer stuff sacks that compression around and top to bottom the bag itself is a great buy 
I went camping where the temps dropped into the low 30s I was wearing just a tshirt and boxers in this bag and was quite warm Its a little bulky for backpacking but not awful Im 61 230lbs with broad shoulders and I found the bag to be a little restrictive I could zip it all the way up but it wasnt very comfortable mostly because Im not used to being mummified Has the temperature dropped another ten degrees I would have dealt with it The length was fine and as previously stated it was quite warm Overall its an exceptional bag for the money but this is now my sons sleeping bag and Im buying something larger 
Its a great price for the bag but like others have already stated its definitely not good at below 30 degrees I just camped out in the Smokey Mountains in October and there were a few cold night the one morning I woke up with snow on the ground And this bag made sleeping very uncomfortable when the temperature dropped to 30 or below I had to put a sheet in the bag and keep it up around the opening at the top to keep the cold air from getting in the bag But like I said for the price I think its a fantastic deal Although if youre going to be camping in cold weather bring a sheet with you 
Took it hunting this weekend and stayed warm in 20 degree weather Everything worked fine If you are an xl shirt size itll be tight but doable in the shoulders 
Very warm and comfortable and definitely large enough for me 61 200lbs with room to spare The only complaint I have is that its hard to roll back up and stuff into the bag it came with 
Great Product and good shipping the sleeping bags we got 2 were in perfect condition and are warm as you can get I would recommend these to anyone looking for a mummy bag that is 0  40 degree for a great price This is the bag to purchase 
Im rating this a 45 only because it narrows a lot at the feet It kept me warm and comfortable in 29 degree weather It is nice and fluffy too so it ads on a little bit of comfort to a sleeping mat as well Im 511 and 230 lbs and it was a great width from my shoulders down to my knees At the feet it narrows a lot this made it a little uncomfortable to move around in and sleep Coleman makes another sleeping bag that does not narrow at the feet which I might look into As far as functioning in colder weather though I cannot complain 
Very nice bags The zippers work well They pack of Nice and small for motorcycle camping My wife and I used them in 40 temperatures and were very comfortable 
Awesome product Kept me warm In October in Florida when the temps at night dropped to 50 degrees i was warm as a bug Not sure how it would fare up in colder temps 
My girlfriend is 59 and she likes this bag It is plenty big for her and keeps her nice and warm No complaints 
Ive read so many bad reviews on this item that I thought well it may at least be good for summer camping trips No way The Coleman North 0 mummy bag is really a 0 degree sleeping bag XD It will keep you warm even on snow fields Despite its shape it is extremely comfortables but you cant sleep in it wearing only your underwears you will wake up all sweated in the middle of the night with inner fabric of the sleeping bag sticked to your sking I had no problems with the zipper indeed it was much better than what I have expected I have bought this item only because of all those who have written that it wasnt warm at all Trust me it will turn hot as hell in there Now I will need to buy a new sleeping bag that can be used on summer time 
i wish it was a little smaller could be rolled or stuffed into a smaller space but i like the fact it is warm and cozy 
I couldnt see spending hundreds of dollars on a sleeping bag so I game this one a shot No problems Im 6ft even and fits me well Personally I wouldnt sleep outside of some type of shelter with it but that is what tents and field expedient shelters are for 
This keeps you very warm Do not use this if camping during the summer months Very comfortable and seals in heat 
Just got the bag very durable material think as hell and very very warm only 2 down sides i have is 1 i cant get it rolled tight enough to go back in the bad and 2 i am an average sized adult but this bag is pretty tight still very happy with it 
It keeps warm made out of nice materials looks nice It has a velcro strap at the shoulder on the zip side to keep it closed but theres no inside zipper clip You have to reach around and zip from outside This is a nice sleeping bag but it can be constricting for anyone who is over 6 foot tall broad in the shoulders or particularly round around the middle 
I would only rate this bag down to 30F but other than that it is very warm and cozy Good for car camping as it rolls up big I live in Alaska and use it only in spring  summer  fall 
its a little heavy for hiking band a little tight in the shoulders for me it did keep me warm and the temps were about 10 degrees for the money its a good bag 
I bought 2 of these things This bag worked great for my last camping trip in Big Bend Temps got down in the low 20s F and me and my GF were just warm enough in our tent So much so we never wanted to get out in the morning The only complaint I have is this thing is a PITA to get back into the bag Much harder than normal it takes two people under optimal conditions 
I do three season hiking in the Appalachian Trail region In early spring and late fall the temperatures can get pretty low I had decided that I wanted a mummy bag previously and began searching for something around the 20 degree range I stumbled upon this bag and given its price thought that it would make a good purchase I believe I made the right choice Pros  This bag is warm While the description states that it is a 0Degree bag I would not suggest using it in that type of weather A lot of individuals see that and believe that they could sleep in 0degree weather comfortably That is not the case My guess is that this bag would be comfortable around 30degrees I have not yet had it out in weather that cold so I cannot say for sure Furthermore in weather that cold I typically place a couple of body or hand warmers in the bag with me You could also use a sleeping bag liner which would make this bag warmer as well For most individuals camping in typical camping weather this bag will be more than enough In order to reach that 0degree rating the bag has a considerable amount of insulation inside of it This makes it fairly comfortable to sleep in I use a selfinflating sleeping pad when I hike The combination of the bag and the pad made for a relatively comfortable nights sleep Cons  As stated above the warmth and comfort is achieved through a generous amount of insulation This also results in the bag being fairly heavy and bulky You will have a difficult time attempting to stuff this into a backpack I use a Teton 5200 and I cannot fit it into the sleeping bag compartment Instead I put it in the main compartment and put my clothes in the sleeping bag compartment If you have the money and will be doing a lot of backpacking I would suggest getting a smaller more manageable bag 
I didnt buy this item on Amazon as Walmart had a good deal on them I finally used it Its not that difficult to put back into its bag Its very soft and comfortable Im 510  170 lbs If you are taller I wouldnt buy it If you are more than 20 lbs heavier I wouldnt buy it either Update Gave it 5 Stars as Ive used it more and its worth the price 
I bought this sleeping bag and camped out in a friends backyard when the low was 37 degrees fahrenheit It wasnt too cold at first although I had to zip up the bag and tighten the hood as much as I could even before the temperature was below 50 However at about 4 or 5 am I woke up because I was too cold to sleep I now use it when I sleep indoors and the temperature gets down to 60 degrees and its just fine for that Theres nothing particularly bad about this product except for the fact that it does not provide nearly enough insulation to back up its 0 degree claim Im returning it 
This thing is pretty nice for the price but if your looking for something more technical you should consider spending the extra money 
It arrived on time and was as expected I would recommend this for anyone who likes high quality items It was also packed very well 
I bought this for a neice that wanted it for a camping trip and specified zero degree I read quite a few reviews of the zero degree sleeping bags online and this one had the best reviews and included that the design helped keep feet warm and that the way the top is constructed helps keep the head and especially neck warm We will find out soon  she is going to hike into the mountains next week first week of January and spend the night sleeping out there with friends in her new sleeping bag All the reviews said she will stay warm and toasty 
Hard to get into and zipped all the way up my head doesnt really fit in the head part so I have to wear a hat when I sleep no biggie its warm 
so far so good for the cost allitle tight but it is a sleeping bag not a queen bed doesnt compress very well  
realy bulky when its just roled up Take it out of the bag and stuff it BBAM you got a very warm bag that takes up little space and is lite 
I selected this sleeping bag so that I dont have to carry extra blankets for chilly nights in the mountain Unfortunately I bought it too late for my car camping season so I havent tried it out yet But here are what I see so far Pros  Very nice design When I got in there I was snuggled up nicely Shoulder straps ad a nice touch for extra warmth  Great price for what you get Cons  Very heavy The outer fabric and filling are not those highend hardcore expensive materials like Marmot  It came with a stuff sack but the dimention is unpractical Too wide around and short If you really want to take the bag to backpacking you might want to consider makinggetting a different dimention stuff sack so that you can carry it better 
i use a tent with rain guard because tent is so ventilated do so to trap some heat my 1st 22 degree night i woke up sweating next night i didnt zip it all the way and slept sound not a fan of the velcro inside the bag that is used to seal your torso inthough i suppose a 1 degree night that may come in handy the foot of bag could have some more room as well little tight but rather that than freezing to death lol it is very comfortablebulky and heavy thoughkeep in mind i sleep off grid in same location so that isnt a factor for me but i would never travel with itwhen i travel i try and keep it at most 50 but usually around 30at this bag is 9that takes away from my food and water and other essential items  sleep tight 
I bought this bag for a fall camping trip and I couldnt be happier about my purchase Camping on a cold night which got down to around 37 degree F I was completely toasty warm This bag made sleeping in a tent that wasnt a 3 season tent a pleasure I recommend it for car camping and I cant wait to try it out in colder temps 
I have over 50 years of camping experience and have owned many bags in my life Not wanting to spend a lot of money at present I bought this bag taking a chance How good could it be for 4000 I am flabbergasted at the excellent quality and features It fits into the stuff sack without too much trouble and its size and weight when packed is what you would expect of a 0 degree nondown bag It is far superior to the previous 120 lb bag my daughter absconded with last year Highly recommended Very well made While I see the price has risen since I bought mine it is still a good deal 
Giving three stars because of the softness of the tension thought it was a bit stiffer However overall the product is well built 
Works great 
very weak springs 
Good quality serves its purpose 
just received it today pretty fast shipping looks like it will be warm hopefully wont have to use it its going in the car just in case something happens and i have to use it unexpectantly 
We bought this for our trip to Yellowstone It was during Spring Break and it was below freezing in the morning when we woke up But I was nice and toasty in my bag 
I slept in this bag under the stars this past Friday March 23 The temperature was about 40 F In addition to a small thin pad the bag in and of itself was very soft and comfortable At about 300 AM we were covered in fog The outside of my bag was really wet At first I thought that it had been raining but it was a ton of condensation However I was completely dry and warm on inside I am excited to try it in colder weather on a winter camp out with snow caves or whatever to test out in the colder weather Excellent purchase Update a few years later Worked great in freezing temperatures 
I was looking for something to strengthen my gold grip and as some players recommended this sort of gadget I thought Id give it a try This comes in numerous resistances so via user error the one I purchased wasnt as strong as I would prefer However again I was not familiar with this so was unsure of which to purchase It was comfortable to hold in my opinion I would repurchase in the future now that I know I need a higher resistance 
After reading all the reviews on here I decided to purchase this sleeping bag for my camping trip this past October I was initially looking to buy an inexpensive sleeping bag for my brother since he didnt have one but I ended up giving him my old Wenzel bag and decided to purchase a newer one for myself I didnt want to spend a lot of money but I didnt want something that was only going to last for one season before falling apart either This Coleman bag fit the bill nicely Since I was pretty much looking to use this particular bag for car camping excursions or short backpacking trips I wasnt as concerned about the weight or bulk of the bag as I normally would be I like the Coleman brand in general and while its definitely not on par with the higher end brand names like The North Face Marmot etc their products do serve their purpose as long as you understand and accept their limitations for what theyre worth This bag is probably too bulky for any real backpacking trips but throw it in the car and its great for car camping and base camp I liked the look of the bag and especially the extra toe space this bag provided After hanging the bag up for a day and letting it air out just to ensure there would be no chemical odors and to allow the bag to loft up I jumped in and my brother and I each tested it out and compared it to my old Wenzel Windy Pass 0degree Mummy Bag from 2008 While both bags offered similar features and comfort I much prefered the zippers on this Coleman bag and found the antisnag feature interesting Overall I found this bag to be comfortable and worth the price Temperatures on our camping trip dropped down to the low 50s at night so I cant really attest to how warm the bag COULD be in colder weather but it was perfectly comfortable on this particular trip Initially I found the bag too hot and had to unzip it open but eventually zipped myself back in as I cooled down and ended up sleeping very well each night of our trip in long underwear in this bag The stuff sack included with the bag is rather large and Im not sure why other reviewers found it difficult to pack it back in I carefully rolled my bag up and packed it in an even smaller compression sack in effort to save space in my car trunk there were 4 of us camping with all my gear packed in my Mazda3 so space was at a premium but it would have been a cinch to just stuff it back into its own included carry sack Overall a good purchase but like others have said probably not the sleeping bag youd want to bring with you on backpacking trips due to its size Great for car camping base camp sleepovers or any other times that space and weight are not an issue In those situations youll probably want to get a higher end sleeping bag for that purpose 
As soon as I opened this bag I had a feeling it wouldnt perform as advertized I often sleep in my backyard so I tried it three times and was chilled enough to come back into the house when the temps hit just the mid to high thirties It doesnt work nearly as well as my last zero degree bag which could take me comfortably down to 1520 degrees Very disappointing Im returning it 
Bought this bag for a trip into the Yellowstone forest Its NOT awesome for backpacking TOO huge TOO heavy But I figured it was a short hike so I could manage Anyway it worked well on that first trip other than it being a pain in the butt to put back in its case and that it was really just comically bulky to even manage on a short hike The next trip was even less work We slept on the side of the road in Big Sur That night I zipped in and hunkered down and the next morning I zipped out but barely The zipper was caught and it just wasnt going anywhere And thats where its at now The zipper is just broken No reason for it at all What a waste of money Updating this review Not for the better either I fixed the zipper with brute force It says its rated for 0 degrees but Ive slept in it on 40 degree nights and FROZE TO DEATH I slept both in multiple layers and no layers 1 Slept in a thermal shirtsweaterjacketsweaterscarf  still froze 2 Slept in nothing but undies and froze The inside of the thing is the same fabric as the outside cold to the touch and it doesnt warm up or remember body heat So yes I still hate it Cant wait till I get a newbetter one 
works well 
makes my hands stronger 
I have got all 3 kill bill swords and all can in perfect condition Very happy with all 
Prop Bill sword from Kill Bill is NOT full tang and feels like blade is loose Seems to be a decent addition to a replica sword display collection not recommended for home defense 
I bought this bag and took it out backpacking at White Sands National Monument in NM in Jan A winter storm hit the day before I left and it was COLD out there Im not sure of the exact temperature but I know that it was either high teens or low 20s My waterbottle and my dogs water bowl both completely froze throughout as did the condensation on the outside of my tent and my car was a big ice block when I got back to it in the morning The bag actually did pretty well I pulled the face hole as tight as I could and just cuddled down inside the bag without sticking my face out it was too cold if I put my face out I have Raynauds disease and my handsnailbeds often are very cold and turn blue in cold weather from poor circulation but they were nice and warm inside the bag without extra gloves on I was impressed by that Overall I was ok but not as warm and comfortable as I would have been at home in my own bed of course It did its job and kept my appendages warm enough and me alive in what could have been hypothermia conditions without the proper gear My only real gripe about this bag is that it is huge when its rolled up Its too big to fit into the sleeping bag compartment of my NorthFace backpacking pack so I imagine its too big for any and it takes up a very large portion of the pack when stuffed in the only way it will fit Due to this reason I wish I would have gotten a different bag It would be great for anyone who is just setting up their tent right next to their car but not the best choice for a backpacker 
Surprisingly it works extremely well and appears well manufactured 
helpful in hand strength 
excellent 
perfet 
Inexpensive example of a great sword Not high end at all but decent none the less 20 sword that I would pay a little more for Just put a good edge on it and it will cut through much the same as the 100 swords 
This is purely an ornamental piece NOT a weapon unless you intend to poke someones eye out But none the less it looks just like the prop used on Kill Bill and looks very nice in my office 
perfect to start Ive ordered some more of varying strengths 
Great for rehab after broken wrist Too easy for healthy person 
great product great seller 
soft metal 
I purchased this sword to put on display in my house I love the Kill Bill Franchise so when I saw this I just had to have it Its a cool looking sword Quality isnt the greatest but for what I spent I didnt expect it to be top notch I wouldnt try and cut anything with it probably would break Looks great on display though 
Wow what a piece of S Plus was supposed to come with holder Guess what no holder Sword is not sharp and is not firmly held in place Totally wobbly and flimsy 
This is to look at not sword fight with or chop wood It doesnt need to be razor sharp If thats your desire go to a local store and get a knife sharpening kit On display this thing really pops 
The large size is about a medium in other brands of socks 
I bought these to replace the old ones I had of the same brand The socks I got have a different look I bought them specifically for their straight black color but it is not what I got even though I order black Be aware 
I ordered this because I already have some These however were thinner than expected but still good I would order them again 
I purchased these socks for PT because nowhere does the picture show a logo and another review mentioned that they used them for PT and had no logo The product must have changed because they do There is a gray foot on the back ankle The sock is a good sock and use them for nonPT work outs but was very disappointed when I opened my package The seller did offer to refund if I shipped them back however I decided to keep them I just can not use them for what they were intended Beyond that they really arent that special Many of the runners socks on the market that come in crazy color options are superior in my opinion I would have never ordered white socks for civy work outs Decent sock not revolutionary though 
Shipping took way too long The seller definitely used all of the estimated delivery time When I finally got it  it was a nice looking sword but it was put together poorly You could tell the used a hot glue gun to titen up loose fittings The blade itself is hardly sharp But overall a decent piece if you just want something to look at 
had trigger finger 3 days 10 min a day cured it 
I really like feetures socks because I like to run with socks that offer a little bit of cushioning Since these socks are a little bit higher up on the ankle I use them for winter running with my tights Other socks that hit just at or below the ankle make it so when I run in the winter with my tights my ankles get cold because the tights dont stay down Also I am a women and bought these because they were cheaper than the other womens version and they fit just fine Seems like a wide range for sizes but they fit great and I wear an eight and a half 
Love these socks Best sock ever No exposed logos This is important for me because in my uniform I cannot wear socks with exposed logos Thank you feetures EDIT 6132014 The white socks are not as pictured anymore They have logos on the top elastic These are no longer suitable for wear in army pt uniform I have changed my rating from 5 stars to 1 star until the picture is updated or they bring back the all white design Cmon feetures 
Didnt use so returned but seemed like its a fine product 
Took this with us to the beach to use at the pool at our rental house You need both sides to be level and youll need additional weight on the supports to keep from pulling the bases into the pool Need more weight on the bases 
Just happens to be at the mall and saw this swordwasnt worth the money they were asking for4X as muchgot to be kidding Stainless steel cheap not design for tameshigiriguys want real katana  save your money get a real one Forget this under 20 junk 
Used for hand and wrist rehab 
My physical therapist had me using this product at my appointments and it was very helpful I searched on Amazon and found it and Im so glad because it is great to have at home to use to bend the joints in my fingers and it really helps Also it saves me money by doing it at home and not paying the cost I was at physical therapy for the same thing Great product Arrived on time and packaged very well 
Cheap 
Doesnt stay up as expected Very difficult to keep net up 
Just exactly what I was looking for I did end up permanently mounting the rods in the base because they kept coming out but that was the only issue that I had 
I recently underwent hand surgery and its been a painful process regaining mobility in my hand and this product for me and my level of recovery is a bit difficult to use  this does not reflect the product itself At the moment I have limited mobility with my left had and putting my hand in a fist is difficult and painful  as of now its extremely hard to push down on this flex hand system  if you are like me I suggest first purchasing the yellow system and work your way up to this one 
My son broke is hand and used these per the PTs recommendation

They are great  They are soft to the touch  go well with any of my Oakland Raiders Gear  They got here before the projected arrial time  which made me receive them just in time for week 3 of preseason  I recommend em to any Oakland Raider fan  Although the Raider logo looks a bit odd  but its expected bc the logo is stitched into the sock  Definite buy  
Came on time and would recommend to all falcon fans Wish they were sold in a pair or a pack since they are not durable 
The socks themselves are great socks but bought them for my Steelers Fans and they loved them Have to get more

My daughter was looking for a sword to hang in her room After some research on Amazon we found this one which combined good looks with decent price She is extremely happy She knows this sword is for decoration only and as such  she is really happy with her purchase  so I believe that should really be the main criteria right I did not give it 5 stars though because I think they could have done a little better job with the product quality 
Ok item A little cheap Now I wonder why I ordered it I guess I got carried away by the movie 
Any sword that is only 15 is in fact very dangerous These swords are called wallhangers because they are only designed to by hung on a wall not swung The reason is that underneath the handle is a very small piece of metal that connects to the blade itself Called the Tang In a real martial arts sword the tang is normally a thick piece of metal that is almost the thickness of the sword itself If you swing a wallhanger too often or too hard it can break at the tang and fly off and hurt someone If you want to learn more about how dangerous these wallhangers are do a google search on the words anatomy of a wallhanger Any sword designed for real martial arts practice like Iaido starts at 250 not 15 and should be bought at a reputable Iaido store sorry I am not allowed to recommend web sites here So be smart either hang this sword back on the wall or throw it out before your baby brothersister hurts someone 
This wallet is an ok basic wallet The quality is pretty cheap however the colors are bright Good wallet just to use every once in a while 
The wallet is great I dont know anything about the team but I have a 6 year old who is infatuated with tigers The tiger image is good quality and all the seams are all well done My only complaint is that the included photo holder was beyond wrinkled The pictures cant even be seen through all the wrinkles Its easily enough replaced but I still knocked off a star for that Whomever was checking quality of these products should not have let that pass 
Good price great delivery 
Updated feedback After just two months of use the wallet lining is coming apart Would not recommend 
This was for our Grandson and he loved it especially with the gift card inside 
It looks really nice I got it for my grandson as a Christmas gift He is a big Michigan fan and will be impressed 
son loves this 
NICE 
Nice

Perfect for my 9 year old grandson Very well made 
I was looking for an Auburn gift for a friend but I was limited on how much I could spend This one is a great value Thank you 
This mirror performed well until my bike fell over and smashed it A rather expensive item to replace every time a bike falls down 
Easy to assemble Gives a nice clear view of whats behind I use it on my hybrid bike with Ergon GP5 grips and it does not interfere with any of the hand positions I want to rate it 5 stars because I am mostly happy with it The only thing holding me back is that I sometimes feel I have too adjust it too often during my rides it loses its position pretty easily I definitely like it much better than my helmet mirror Im happy enough with it that Im not considering any more mirror options 
The other handlebar mounted mirrors didnt seem to provide a good vies These protect the ends of the handlebars if the bike falls 
As is the case with just about every other cheap bicycle accessory this mirror is made primarily of cheap flexible plastic parts that arent durable and wont last over the long run My particular mirror has gradually come loose over several months The bike nor mirror has not suffered any major spills Instead I often find myself leaning the bike on the left side where the mirror is attached Each time the mirror gently bumps against a wall or car or some other vertical surface which I lean the bike against The mirrors upper hinge has become looser and looser to the point where it now simply flops around and wont hold its place I suppose the mirror is designed with a tiny bit of give or play to allow for easy adjustment as a result the mirror is easy to move and jar loose with even the slightest pressure resulting over time in a loose joint with a lot of play that simply cannot be tightened Its par for the course its a 12 mirror so durability may be too much to ask but there must be a manufacturer out there who can design a mirror that doesnt loosen over time even if it requires selling at a slightly higher price point 
You dont know what youre missing till you put a mirror on your bike This is perfect for checking to see if theres a car behind you and to your left waiting to cut you off and possibly hit you 
Easy to install But dont let the bike fall over Its easily broken 
Stays nice and tight in the handlebars on my commuter but still easily adjustable In use with some Ergon GP2 grips Works great Read the instructions and dont use a lube to make it easier to assemble Its supposed to be hard to assemble Helps it hold its position Cool that its from a local Colorado company too made in China though 
so well made love it 
nice  
I have just installed it and so far the product has exceeded my expectations I must say I gave big pieces of the manual a miss as I just couldnt understand what they were trying to describe But the picture is there and that is all you need to assemble The manual does contain an important advice  the screws will go in very tight into the brass sockets so please persevere nothing will break provided you have set your tool correctly The tight going is by design so it wont get loose The products plastic is sturdy enough I will be using this product on the road I cannot imagine it will survive MTB ride through the bush as it sticks out beyond your bike Next is to check this in action 
I really like this mirror Good visibility easy install tool provided You do have to cut out the bar end of your grip which is no big deal And it has replacement parts for that inevitable fall over or crash but since mount swivels three ways that may not be a problem 
Has been great Did not have to cut ends off grips  just put a three bladed slice in the end and slipped it inside Good image stable easy to install 
nice 
Seems to be a little bulky you dont need to use the elbow Attached it to my racing bike  Im gonna put two of these on my bike 
Great mirrorrs at a good price  
These are great mirrors for bycicles I have several 
Stays in place and adjusted Wish they had an x large version for old eyes 

does the job and fits the bill 
These work great and are very steady even on a somewhat rough road They give a clear picture behind you It takes a wrench to adjust them but not much trouble to get the job done I marked mine so I would not have to readjust every time I took them off 
High quality and easy to install I thought it was a bit expensive but the mirror really is solid and I feel much safer riding the local streets This is not a toy cheapo item 
HIGHLY RECOMMEND for every serious cyclist to add one of these to their ride No joke Easy to install Works like it should Im happy with it 
Works very well 
Chinese junk I bought 1 of these mirrors and it did not last a month and another with on already on it and neither lasted over a month These mirrors have very weak plastic frame hardware so dont dare to sneeze looking at the mirrors they are totally crap 
Good design but your handlebars need to be open at the end I have two Catrikes and these mirrors are a must I just wish the mirror material was actual glass maybe it is as it gets a little fuzzy over time maybe I should clean it with steel wool if its glass it will look great again if its plastic it will get fuzzier and Ill know better 
Best mirror I have found for any bicycle Adjustable Stays in place even on rough terrain Easy installation 

excellent view with its convex glass mirror Very stable sturdy and rugged 
I have these on five bikes Its the best one I have ever used I commute 1420 miles a day These give me added confidence and safety when in traffic 
Exactly s described 
Works fine on my Trek Probably wont hold up to a crash but I usually lay it down on the other side for some reason 
Simple to install youll need a hole in your grip so it can be inserted in handlebar Multiple ways to mount Glad I made the purchase 
Easy to install and works well Bigger than many mirrors and mounts higher for better visibility Good product 
lover this mirror it makes riding a bicycle much safer 
awesome 
This one fit well and looks good Cant wait for warmer weather 
Works great 
Love it great quality for the price easy to install on my Giant Roam buy it without hesitation 
Perfect 
I take rides with the family sometimes so this is really useful to see if others are grouped together behind me or if anyone is having an issue Also good for traffic Installation wasnt too hard Durability seems good The mirror seems to smudge easily but easy enough to clean often 
Ive used these mirrors previously and been very happy with them There is so little vibration that the rear view is very clear Highly recommended 

Great 
Nice 
Fits both of my bikes and helps me keep track of upcoming traffic 
This is the second mirror we purchased Happy with the first on one bike so added a mirror to our other bike Works well 
Pretty happy with this thing considering the price It slides into the inside tube of the handlebars and holds in there by compression When not in use you can twist it inwards I twist it in and out a few times each day and after three weeks its still as strong and reliable nothing loosened as when I first installed it Very steady while on the road and you can adjust the angle to however best fits your preference 
Best bar end mirror ever It even works with my Bachetta recumbent and recumbent trike 
Really great accessory for your bike It was really easy to install and doesnt move unless you move it Really good field of view makes me feel a lot safer when riding 
This thing is really reflective and you can use it to see behind you I think thats its point in life so I should rate it highly It is a little weird how many screws and washers you need to assemble it though Probably couldve been built better 
EXCELENTE 
A good quality bike mirror at a fair price 
After trying several different mirrors this really did the trick Very easy to install and works great 

Cant live without it 
Inexpensive and it works I can now see what is about to run into me 
Once you figure out the correct angle for yourself if works fine 
Easy to install easy to adjust once adjusted it stays adjusted Good rear view and clarity 
Dont leave your home without this Great product durable and easy to install It provides almost 180 degree view of the road behind you 2000 miles and staying safe Get it 
I bought a pair of these for my eBike It is good to know what is behind you The mount easily and are quite adjustable Im very please and would recommend these highly to anybody looking to purchase bike mirrors 
Great little mirror Got it on with a very small amount of cussing which is why I dont put childrens toys together Really helps living in log truck country to be able to see them sneeking up on me Technology has made them much quieter and more dangerous too good mirror 
Installed the day it arrived Use it on every ride Works great fits great no issues Stays where you adjust it no slippage A great mirror 
great prooduct 
I installed this on my old Trek a few months back I really like the piece of mind it gives me when riding public roads Its also great when riding with another person or group to keep track of how much gap youre getting behind you to the next bike 
a great safety feature 
So far so good 
Easy to install  perfect size I prefer this over a helmet mirror 
We have a tandem and I put this on the front handle bars and it works great Easily adjustable and gives a much needed rear view We bought a helmet mounted mirror for my wife and couldnt make it fit Sent it back and bought another one of these for the back Glad we went this route Now we both see whats approaching 
Great little mirror 
Great price fast delivery 
These are great mirrors I pull a bike trailer for small children 2 seats and this mirror allows me to keep careful watch on them As you might expect when the bike tips over and lands on the end of the handle bars the mirror breaks But I will only replace them with this style because it works so well for the way I use it 
they work 
Very happy with the product 
Good side view mirror 
A solid mirror for not a whole lot of money The trick to assembly is using brute force you cant hurt it 
Easy to install and works 
stays in place and a good product kind a a pain to install but I did it myself without any hiccups 
A couple of years ago I bought this mirror for my mountain bike and now I bought another one for my commuter bike Installing it on the left side of the handle bar was easy and took about 10 minutes I love how you can twist it up or down adjust the angle as needed and move it out of the way when transporting or storing your bike It gives you a good view of the road behind you All in all a great little bike mirror 
I already had one of these on my first bike I tried a smaller one convex one on my second bike and I loved it but it was not durable Came back to this one Its solid easily adjustable and offers a great view of the trail behind me 
There is a reason these mirrors are found on almost every brand of Recumbent you can buy They are simply the best rattle  vibration free mirror you can buy for the money 
Thanks to the Mountain Mirrycle Company for shipping my rear view mirror on the very same day I ordered it That means a lot to me and using USPS it was here in just a couple of days Excellent service While studying the pieces and installation instructions I originally thought the tight screws were wrong until closer examination proved that these are self cinching type screws and something I had never seen before Truly ingenious and they are working really well Following the instructions everything fell into place and it is easy to see why this mirror is a best seller at Amazon It is exactly what was needed and it works perfectly I have a great view of what is coming up behind me now 
screws too tight shouldve used shorter screws 
Pretty handy  a must have 
Easy installation and works as expected 
wortth it 
Nothing bothers me more than a bicycle mirror that cannot handle bumps or aggressive riding Ive owned a Mirrycle before and tried other brands that did not perform I can say with great confidence that once installed and tightened into your bike it is as close to rocksolid as you can get Bicycle mirrors are not an option but an absolute necessity when riding in traffic Allen wrench included 
Worked great 

Great quality Install is a little bit of a pain but not impossible Comes with all the tools you would need to install it 
i returned this item 
I have bought a few over the years for my different bikes and for my wife and kids They are pretty durable and work well Easy to install Highly recommended 
They are working perfectly as designed At first installing them and tightening them felt a little disconcerting because its very difficult to tighten them down Then I realized why This design cleverly uses friction to keep the mirror locked in place once you adjust it You just have to make sure you dont over tighten them to the point of breaking the plastic or stripping the threads Just keep feeling how easy it is to move and adjust them as you slowly tighten more and more and they will be perfectly adjusted The slightly parabolic view helps get a wide angle view of traffic Since I drive on the right side of the road I felt a left mounted mirror was enough Please be aware they do make the bike handles wider so you have to be more careful negotiating in narrow areas or you will bump them and have to readjust Not a big deal though 
Wow what a great mirror Mine has handle abuse of the bike being set down on them frequently 
Just completed my first ride on my MTB bike with this mirror and I am very pleased The mirror gives a clear precise view and is easy to adjust It is quick to assemble although when the instructions say that the bolts are hard to tighten during assembly they are not kidding I would recommend this to any bike rider 
works great  like the design 
Good design mirror can be pivoted inward and out of the way Sits tightly inside the handlebar a real plus over other models Works well once its mounted on the bike That will be a lengthy exacting task because of the many small even tiny parts and instructions that could be clearer should have illustrations from ALL angles Included very thin Allen wrench will dig in the flesh of your fingers when you torque it to tighten the bolts 
This works out to be a great mirror I dont understand the reviews saying t it so hard to put together may be those re the same people that are overwhelmed when they have to screw the handles on the new St they ordered on line T can be used on left or right bar ends Now have them on both my straight bar hybrid and rise bar comfort bike I will make one warning These make your bike much wider I ended up taking the one off my right side  had them on both sides at first Ride a lot of multi use trails that have those ars you have to ide between at the trail head With these on both sides I would often clip one on the way thru To their credit hey did not break but for me at least they just make the bike a bit too wise if used on both sides 
Fit perfect Very nice mirror 
Terrific Very solid doesnt jiggle while riding my recumbent 
Better choices out there Works ok on smooth pavement vibrates loose off road fire roads nothing toughv 
This device is such a lifesaver I was very uncomfortable riding on my village streets until it was installed Installation was simple and took about 5 minutes Everyone should use this product on their bicycles 
This is my third bike Ive mounted on of these onsimple to mount and a potential lifesaver The plastic is thick and hardnearly bakelite in consistency but not as brittle The mounting washers allow for easy positioning of the mirror in full 360 degrees in both the vertical and horizontal plane Honestly I dont know why someone would ride a bike without one of these 
Good quality and a solid fit However like others I had some difficulty in screwing in the very tight fitting parts Finally I gently clamped vise grips onto one piece and could then leverage the include allen wrench enough to complete the assembly Using the expanding piece that goes inside the handlebar tube made for a very secure fit 
I have three of these for my electric bikes Well designed and provides a good view of the area behind me Takes a few minutes to assemble Fits tightly into the end of the bike handle You must take out the plug that most bikes have Tight but loose enough to allow adjustment Not sure how it would hold up to impact such as if the bike hit the ground Not expensive and I would get same as replacement if this happened 
Item arrived on time and in excellent condition It installed easily and gives a good view of what is behind you It does stick out quite a bit which can get in the way of things but it pretty much has to be that way to get the great view I would recommend this to others 

This is a good standard mirror 2 for under 30 is even better I put one on my bike and my sons Make the screws and washer fittings tight but not over tighten and it stays in place well while making it easy to adjust For that be sure to put it together the way the instructions indicate  dont leave out any washers etc Takes a little time to assemble the first one but well worth itComes with 2 different ends to stick in your handle bar Probably fits everyones except solid bars Best of all the image of behind you is very clear and has a good visibility range 
These work really well Added to the handlebars on both my Townie 7 and my wifes cruiser When properly adjusted you get a great clear view of a good distance behind Makes riding along the roadside MUCH safer 
Allen screw stripped out during install Now it doesnt stay in place I will return to the bike shop where I bought my previous two We installed those and had no problem 
The rear view mirror attaches quickly and works great 
Quick and easy to Replace use and adjust 
I have one of these on each of my bikes 2 hybrids and one road bike They are great as they are a good size and can be positioned where you need them I especially like it on my road bike as it mounts on the end of the drop down and in ever position it gives me a good view and helps prevent me from being surprised by a vehicle coming up behind me 
This bike mirror really is deserving of the high praise and ratings When I ordered this mirror I also ordered the Hafny Bar End Bike Mirror and the Venzo Handlebar Stainless Steel Mirror The latter two were much smaller in mirror image surface making your rearward view somewhat insufferable Also they werent shabby but their product engineering was inferior to the Mirrycle The Mirrycle is engineered with male hex bolts that screw into microtapered female brass pieces that become tighter and tighter as you screw the hex bolt in place Yes it is a bit difficult to screw the hex bolt into place with the hex key provided but what you get when youre finished is a rearview mirror on your handlebar that does not jiggle Yes it bounces as the handlebar bouncescant avoid the physics of bicycle ridingbut all the jiggle in the mirror is eliminated With the larger mirror surface you get a much better rearward view and you can adjust it with your hand Terrific product and terrific value I wish I had not waited to get this 
perfecthighly adjustableeasy installation just take your time cutting off rubber end of your grip and do not over cut I inserted the point of razor knife into the end and not around the end of the grip which insured I did not remove too much of the grip and worked perfectly I keep the allen wrench in my bag just in case I need to tighten but likely will not need any adjustmentI left just enough play where I can still adjust but it stays in position I definitely recommend this 2 piece set 
Easy to mount Works as expected 
I have bought several of these I live on the 3rd floor and use an elevator and small door into my apartment so the foldin feature works great 
Works good 
Sent it back I didnt realize the end of my bike handle does not come off 
I bought one of these for my own bike a couple of years ago from a bike shop and just recently bought a second one here on Amazon for another new addition to the bike fleet This little thing is more sturdy than I give it credit for When the mirror heats up outdoors in the sun the fittings can get loose I have been able to tighten them beyond what I think is safe for plastic yet it has held up with no problem and even at that tightness the mirror is still adjustable Luckily the grips I use on both bikes made by Ergon have open ends so I was easily able to put the mirror into the left handlebar end without having to cut or modify the original grips This isnt a huge mirror but when aimed correctly I have no problem seeing behind me even on city roads This beats those ridiculous helmetmounted mirrors that move with your head shake and are impossible to focus on 
Wish I had put this on my bike years ago Makes is much safer to ride the bike lanes on busy streets 
Must read the instructions carefully but the mirror does have a snug fit and should stay in line once adjusted Its all plastic so if the bike falls I doubt the mirror and mount will survive Much better mirror than the ones that velcro around the end of the handlebar 
Fits well and provides good rear view and is adjustable Put this on my Ancheer Electric MT Bike 
Easy to install Gives a relatively good view to the rear 
Durable and reliable Can make multiple adjustments day after day eg folding the bike mirror in and out to get it in and out of my bike in and out of my front door easier and it does not get loose The mirror uses multiple washers and very stiff threaded bolts it feels like you are stripping the threads but as the instructions state this is the way it is designed which helps prevent the bolts from becoming loose 
Only mirror I have tried that holds its position when adjusted Good field of view 
Worked great for years 
Adjustable very clear visibility have attached to my new bicycle I highly recommend 
I was a bit put off when I first received this several weeks ago it appeared to be just a cheap plastic product The instructions also tell you to double up the washers on the stem with the result that you cant tighten it enough to stop it from being moved without breaking it But thats the beauty of it The joints are just stiff enough to hold their position without moving or shaking while riding but still allow easy adjustment and will swing out of the way if theyre brushed by someone waling past it 
great 
Ive tried another bike mirror for a little less money but Im definitely gonna come back to this one from now on It feels so much more solidly built and offers the ability to tighten every moving part with a tool unlike the slightly cheaper mirror I liked before Definitely 100 recommended 
speedy ship great product as advertised 
Gets the job done if this is what youre looking for but I prefer the mirror on my helmet to see behind me 
I liked mine so much I bought one for my wife Mounts to most handlebars The curvature gives a wide field of view Its breakable I broke my first one but replacement mirror sections are available from Amazon and retail 
great for road bikes stable 
Good quality Nice mirrors 
Brought one for each of our bikes We are not avid bikers but like to see what is coming up behind us and these work very well 

Just got the mirror the other day and it seems like it will be a Great purchase It assembles easy and fits tight in handle bar 
Ive purchased at least five of this model mirror over the last several years to go on several different bikes They work better than any other mirror Ive owned and are rugged Ive never had the glass part crack even after hitting posts while riding with the back side of mirror I have had to replace the stem piece that fits up inside the handlebars after a bike fell over on the mirror and another time when the mirror hit a post But over all I think this is a excellent bicycle mirror 
works 
Quick easy to install probably fits any bar and nice quality not necessarily something I need but very happy I Purchased it 
Really what you need Easy to set up 
I like it even though it is a convex mirror things in the mirror are closer than they appear In the past Ive used nearly identical mirrors of the same brand and price and they have worked out great just be careful the mirror doesnt hit anything or that the bike doesnt fall over because I have broken the glass in one of them before I still prefer this style because the image is much clearer than other types of mirrors 
Using this on my recumbent trike Working well even though the handles on trike are at a odd angle 
This mirror is very adaptable It can be mounted many ways depending on your need and preference It provides a decent rear view for just about any type of bike It isnt indestructible but none of them are 
Works well nice quality made in USA Only downside is that the glass is breakable although Ive had no trouble so far 
Tried the mirror that went straight out of the handle but they were hard to see all the time This one lets you adjust it so your hand and arm are not blocking it I have one on all our bikes havent found a bike it didnt work on I did have to cut the end of the handle grip to insert it but that was better then having the strap on mirrors that interfer with your grip 
Best bike mirror I have ever had I ride on chip seal and this mirror viberates less than all others 
With the way folks drive now days I feel a lot more comfortable being able to see cars approaching behind me This is a high quality mirror and doesnt shake Installed on a Trek DS2 and my wifes Trek 72 
Outstanding product Clear written directions with good illustrations Highly recommended Purchased 3 for my MTBs No issues whatsoever 
This mirror fits well and gives a solid view I read other reviewers before buying about being difficult to assemble The mirror comes with a very good picture for assembly Any first grader could follow those directions The only difficulty is the bolts fit a little snug to prevent the mirror from coming loose while biking I have riden several hundred miles without any issues I would buy again 
Easy to install and holds its adjustment Its an asset for safe riding 
Good quality and quite adjustable adds a lot of convenience to my cycling 
Nicely made in the USA The plastic is polycarbonate with threaded brass inserts for the screws Assembly was easy as long as the screws were oiled first The threaded brass inserts are slotted and tapered closed inside the plastic This makes them self locking so the screws wont loosen up The screws on mine were going in so tight that they creaked like the door to a haunted house A drop of motor oil helped a lot without defeating the self locking feature The glass mirror pivots and stays where you want it until it gets bumped too hard where it will swing away Nice feature to prevent breakage It is slightly convex for a wider field of view but not a whole lot to severely distort the perception of distance It fits into the hollow end of the handlebar and locks in with a screw activated wedge system 
Im not good with puzzles or mechanical things and had to watch some youtube vids and did take me about 15 hoursbut because Im not good with these thingsbut finally figured it outWe are often told not to tighten screws too much to not strip but in this case I HAD to tighten alot just to get it to tighten upbecause I kept thinking I mightve had the wrong screws or doing something wrongjust keep tightening Watch the youtube vids Very helpful 
Nice little mirror works well Easy to install 
Nice High quality But little adjustment is possible 
Attached easily to my Giant hybrid bike and so far works as expected 
GOOD PRODUCTWELL MADE 
Best mirror I ever bought 
Excellent product 
Good quality mirror that works well 
My absolute favorite bike handlebar mirror and Ive tried several 
Just installed the Mirrycle bicycle mirror today and took it for a test run A few observations and comments Agreed assembly is not entirely easy As mentioned by numerous reviews the screws drive hard to the point that you think youre actually cracking the plastic plus the included Allen wrench requires some strength to turn But not to worry Read the instructions and theyll confirm the hard drive and that you will not crack the plastic I didnt try WD40 or any other lubricant so cannot say if that would ease the assembly I installed the Mirrycle onto a GT hybrid bicycle and after using a Dremel tool to create an opening in the end of my handle grip I found the handlebar opening accepted the smaller of the two wedges for mounting I chose to follow the alternative down and under installation mentioned on Amazon reviews which is quite clever and works very well however I believe you may get a better site picture using the normal above and to the side installation which would facilitate not having to move your eyes so far from your frontal path to do so The primary disadvantage to the normal upandout installation is that the mirror really sticks out there very exposed and ifwhen you dump your bike or ride close to any shrubs etc your mirror will be the early casualty plus the storage shed where we keep our bikes is small which would necessitate tucking the mirror in upon each return Do whichever works best for you From the lower mounting position I could see both myself and directly behind me but I dont believe that provides the maximum field of view On my initial trip I stopped a couple times to adjust the mirror in a similar manner to what you would do with a car ie if you can see part of yourselfyour bike in the mirror tilt it out just a little further until you cant and that should be about right Once adjusted properly you only need to tilt your head a tad one way to see either part of yourself directly behind the mirror or a tad the other way to see much more of the road to your direct left I was amazed at how solid this mirror rode exhibiting absolutely no jitter or vibration The large convex shape offered a wide clear field of view which allowed me not only to see what was coming from behind me but also what was to the near left rear of me as well This was only my first day with this product but Im impressed with the quality and the flexible mounting options it offers 
These work real well Ive had several on different bikes 
This has got to be the best 15ish dollars Ive put into my bike so far For anyone wondering I use the Radmini electric bike from RAD POWER BIKES and this fits I would imagine this fits most bikes because it comes with two different adapters Make sure you do not drop with the mirror sticking out this mirror is made of glass not plastic it will shatter If it does happen I noticed amazon sells replacements for 7 bucks which isnt horrible 
We break 1 every 9 months or so It would be nice if they offered replacement parts 
Great for getting an Idea as to whats behind you and whats coming your way 

Small but should be useful Easy mount once you get it put together 
Good product but initial adjustment is difficult Once adjusted and tightened it seems to keep alignment even if accidentally bumped a little Tight squeeze getting it thorough doorways if mounted the way the advertising shows 
EXCELLANT 
Had it just one day and already wonder why I didnt do this sooner 
This fit perfectly on my bike handle and is awesome to see what is coming up from behind on the bike paths as not to be surprised by the On your left 
Works as advertised 
This is a sweet mirror Easy to assemble and mount Easy to leave a slight swivel for adjusting view Can swivel in toward center for bringing bike through narrow doorways into house Exactly what I wanted for safety and convenience 
I wish it had a spring arm in it 
Love it 
After finally receiving an unused set of mirrors I can give an assessment These are great 
Love the mirrors which are mounted on a recumbent trike Sometimes one raps the mirror against an obstacle and the mirror needs to replaced Once set the mirrors stay in place Should another obstacle be encountered Id buy these again 
Works good 
When I received this mirror I was not impressed It came in about 7 pieces not counting screws and washers But its simple to put together and I was surprised by how well this small mirror lets me see what is behind me I even had the bike accidently tip over and mirror simply turned at the elbow of arm and mirror was undamaged Im satisfied with this product Update this mirror is almost indestructible My heavy Sondors ebike has fallen on this mirror 4 times now and mirror has survived all 4 times and once I hit a post with it I have ordered 2 more and every bike has one on it 
I had one on the left side of my Catrike and put this on the right side It was delivered fast and I had no problems mounting or using it I recommend this product Good price 
Easy to mount and easy to use A must when riding on the roads and also helpful when trail riding 
Have had many different bike mirrors This one is my favorite I purchased this one because I crashed and the first one shattered This is the only mirror I will ever use 
Outstanding product the mirror is easy to assemble and adjust after assembly Very pleased 
Good bar end mirror good angles 
Excellent 
Very nice 
This had turned out to be the best bike mirror I have ever owned Had it now 3 months and had 0 problems with it breaking 
practical 
So far the mirror has met all my expectations 
I use this with another that I gave a higher mark to But these are very good My eyesight is not good and I need all the help I can get 
Good design 
Fine fine mirror 
This is the second one I got I loved the first one but wanted one on each side durable i have dropped my bike on it a couple of times and hasnt rusted yet several years old This is super easy to install and folds in for ease of use 
Flimsy does not mount well nor stay stable yes instructions properly followed 
Five minutes assembly Easy to assemble if you look at the diagrams enclosed This mirror shakes the same amount your handle bar does My handlebar outside diameter is 78 This would install on a slightly larger handlebar or a much smaller one it comes with a second smaller crimping insert than the one I used with my handlebars For the price excellent 
I bike commute and consider a mirror a necessity and this one fits perfectly into my handle bar end I like that is comes with 2 shims and wrench to assemble it I ride on very bumpy roads and the mirror stays in place even though I have kept the swing arm loose enough to turn the mirror inwards to fit through our gate and for parking at the bike rack I tried using a mirror on my helmet but just couldnt get used to it I have this mirror set so I dont have to take my eyes off the road ahead of me to see cyclists or cars coming up on me Very happy with my purchase 
love it 
I know Amazon beats a local bike shop but when the gap is so severe I keep coming back for more supplies just ordered some bike locks same 
Great replacement for a bar end one that broke when bike fell over Bike has fallen with this one and the joints just pivoted out of alignment rather that breaking the mirror or arms Good view to rear or to dog trailer when used with dropdown bars 
Nice mirror multiple positions make it very versatile Solid built plastic with brass inserts allow unit to be tight yet allow tool less adjustments 

Good 
as adverftised 
My husband bought this for his bike as we are mostly biking around town and its nice to know if a car is coming up behind us so we can move overa lot of our streets are narrow and none have bike lanes It does stick out pretty farwhich is probably what makes it work so well but keep that in mind when cutting close to parked carstelephone poles etc 
Very solid construction Easy to install A very fair price Would buy again 
Worked well 
Works in a few position good buy 
Very easy to install on my Cannondale Adventure and much easier to see in my opinion than a helmet mirror Will be getting another one for the wifes bike 
I installed the mirror with instructions provided It works well 
This mirror is easy to install and I like that it fits on the end of the handlebar I bought it for my replacement bike The old one with the same mirror was stolen a few months back Its mostly plastic so there is little to rust The mirror tilts so you place it how you want it and adjust it while riding if necessary The viewing angle is good for most riders 
Terrific product  wish I had one earlier  makes a huge difference in riding 
Good mirror at a good price Easy to install and gives you good vision 
Always a great item I have ordered several for my bike and others Same great quality every time 
I tried various mirrors for my hybrid bike so when I ordered this I was worried it would give a distorted view or it would keep loosening up and be a waste of money My worries are all forgotten This mirror works great and if it every breaks Ill order the exact same thing 
so 20th century with regard to attachment but also quite effective adjustable viewing with a little experimentation good viewing area stable just kind of old school with the attachments which are basically friction fit used on 16 mile bike commute with 5 miles of dirt and gravel and 2 miles of bike lanes with cars still alive we have two other mirrors available but I would pick this one from the three options still 
My second bicycle mirror Im very happy with product It arrives with different inserts so you should be able to make it work for your needs 
Works great 
East to install and makes me feel somewhat safer on the roads I can watch for the idiots playing with there phones 
Bought this for my road bike and love it 2016 Specialized Sirrus Sport Sturdy stays in place perfect size circle to see who is coming up behind me Highly recommend this product 
Perfect mirror for my tastes Scratches easily 
Is better than nothing 
I installed one of these on my mountain bike fifteen years ago Survived lots of heavy trail riding banging into trees etc Recently the plastic stem finally cracked and I was delighted to find out that the same Mirrycle MTB bar end mount design is still available Not surprising I guess since they pretty much nailed it the first time The mirror is large enough to provide an excellent view of the whole road behind Unlike smaller mirrors or helmetmounted mirrors this model doesnt require your head to be in exactly the right position to see the road behind you No way cars will sneak up on you with this model Installation is very simple and adjustment is almost as easy as adjusting side mirrors on a car although youll probably want to use a tool to really tighten it into position once its angled exactly as you want it As I mentioned durability for me has been outstanding The arm holds the mirror out a few inches from the end of the handlebar which is great for visibility but if you ride narrow trails with trees or cliffs really tight on the sides theres a chance youll scrape the mirror on obstacles from time to time Ive had this happen but I just twist the mirror back into position Great visibility outstanding durability inexpensive An excellent investment in riding safety 
Works great  makes me feel a lot safer on the streets 
Very sturdy and great field of view 
its on the wifes bike shes a big fan and its invaluable for riding safely while in traffic 
Great strong  sturdy mirror Sticks out a little too much but 
GETS IN THE WAY IF I HAVE TO TURN MY TRIKE HARD LEFT 
This works really well so far Just follow the instruction by people here on how to cut the end part of your handle off to fit this mirror So far its holding up good on my bike 
Had one of these on my bike for over 10 years works great 
Works great helps not having to twist and turn around to see if there is anyone coming up on one as they are bicycling Best price I found also 

Great product Easy to install and look great No real vibration when riding I put one on each side and mounted them down from the axis of the bars they work well and are out of the way I would definitely buy these again 
Besides helmet this is the best safety device 
Run dont walk to get one of these for each bike you own 
Easy installation quality build Ive whacked it off a telephone pole and a work Truck mirror as I zipped by it was parked and no damage at all Can adjust while riding if you do it carefully Would definitely buy again 
I think I have tried 34 versions of a bike rear view mirror From helmet mount to bar mount This one took a little more effort to mount but it was worth it Stable and easy to adjust Love it 
I have use this type mirror for over 34 years I just bought 2 new bicycles and tried one of the mirrors that strap onto your hand grip Well if you have a bike that has the twist shiftier on the handle bars you lose some of your hand grip space so you are always hitting the mirror and then well I lost it feel off some wear But not this one you would just about have to wreck your bike to lose it And it is glass not plastic so it is clearer to see with You can set it high or set it below your handle bars and it sets out enough that it goes past your shoulders to see But is not a mirror that you can just take on or off It has to pretty much stay on The only thing that you may not like is you have to cut of the end of the hand grip to put it on as it goes into the handle bar But when in place you do not notice the cut out 
I own 3 of these mirrors and have one on each of my bikes When I crash and smash one I buy two because I know its going to happen again Its the best mirror for me 
It is a nice mirror  however the the threads on the screws are very tight I thought I must have them cross threaded I kept on checking after a while I just forced them on They did not break however I could see the plastic parts breaking with the twisting to get them on Be careful if this happens to you it did turn out nice Update I did get another one for my other bike a little grease will help 
perfect for my needs 
Breaks too easily for a mountain bike 
Bought this to replace Cateye mirror that broke in one day It was garbage This seems to be 10 times more sturdy Im sure it will hold up for a long time and I will be purchasing more of them for other bikes in the near future 
Good 
Quality product My daughter loves it A little pricey 
Kind of cheap and fragile but hey what isnt Works great 
This did not work for my hybrid bike Trek F3 Very frustrating 
Perfect 
This is the best mirror I have found in years Very little road shake slightly convex great view 
Good product Good adjustability Image in mirror very clear 
This mirror works great on my bicycle and keeps me much safer Installation was easy 
Works excellently Easy install on a beach cruiser My daughter loves it 
A real mirror The only caveat is you must take care not to lean your bike on the handlebar sides with mirror Think twice if you intend to put this on a mountain bike and then hit a single track trail 
Great 
Excellent quality and item was delivered right on time The Tiger in the family loves and has plenty of room to throw articles about USC way I should send Steve one 
Sturdy basket Tells all who see it your allegiance Good size for office or home Would recommend it Go Cuse 
I am fixing my husbands man cave bathroom up in NC Tar Heels and this looks great in the room 
This a fairly cheaply made product No way around that since trashcans are not complex or highly engineered products That being said this is good product The printing was great and it was well made except for a sharp place at the top seam where the sheet metal that forms the sides meets the top The sheet metal corner wasnt fully rolled over and under the rim A squeeze with a pair of pliers and a little black electrical tape would have fixed it I went a little better and soldiered the seam at the top Perfect now 
Came quickly no surprises Big enough for my basement gets the job done no complaints go Terps Pretty good size and quality 
I love this trash can it has a great Hokie theme on it and is pretty sturdy It can get dented if you hit it pretty hard and the bottom can rust eventually but overall Id say its a great trash can for a pretty reasonable price 
Great  For Left Side to see all the Idiots coming up on you that cant Drive  
Makes the footprint a bit wide but it work s great Easy to install Would buy again 
Great price 
Intelligent design optional parts to guarantee fit just the right convex setting your arm does not block it holds tight even on bumpy roads 
Super mirror that fits into end of handbar Excellent quality mirror Plastic parts seem to be sturdy  but not unbreakable Avoiding a fall on a mirror or smashing it into a car for travel Enjoy the ride Note that this will work on both road bikes and mountain style bikes including hybrids 
This is a great little mirror Ive had others that were made of plastic that were very difficult to see behind you This mirror has minimal vibration while riding The only problem is now i have to buy another because the wife wants one 
This is an excellent mirror Mounts tight inside the handlebar end and makes it easy to see behind you Kudos on the mirror Most manufacturers give you the Objects are closer than they appear type mirror which to me is just plain distortion Not Mirrycle What you see in their mirror is actually what youve got coming behind you A normal view Love thatNo distortions Highly recommend this mirror 
I do a lot of commuter travel on my bike this mirror is perfect Can see object behind me other mirrors dont pickup 
this mirror is very stable and has excellent positioning and field of view Easy to install as well 
Love this mirror A number of pieces to assemble but not a big deal Straightforward and clear directions Adds so much safety to my ride now Highly recommend 
Very easy to install and a great mirror 
Need a longer post to be able to see around rider 
I installed this a couple of weeks ago This mirror is well designed and exceeded my expectations When I first started installing it I thought it was defective because I could not get the threads of the screws to start I tried grinding the starter thread because it would not start more than a 12 turn Then I remembered what I had read when I ordered it and looked at the instructions The tight threads are this way by design This allows you to adjust the mirror while riding so that you can get it exactly where you want it The alternative would be very difficult You would have to adjust then ride then adjust and readjust every time it would get moved Or the screws would back out when the mirror gets turned The mirror will allow you to see oncoming traffic on both sides of the road or regardless of whether you riding with or against traffic because it has a wide field of view An excellent value for the money The only thing I would like to see different is the type of plastic The plastic in the mirror mount I bought is hard and probably brittle I suspect it will break if I drop the bike or otherwise strike the mount with any appreciable force The brittle hard plastic is no doubt necessary to facilitate the tight threads so the female threaded portion wont come loose or break free inside the plastic when tightening A think a better but no doubt more expensive design would incorporate some flexibility to avoid breakage 
Best mirror out there for the money Sticks out far enough so you can see behind you Inexpensive but worth every dime You MUST know what is behind you and YOU CANNOT KEEP TURNING YOUR HEAD TO FIND OUT 
Be sure to check what kind of hand grips you have on your bike if you have ones similar to the BONTRAGER INFORM SATELLITE CITY GRIP you will need to purchase the same style mirror but designed to fit into these grips 
BEST MIRROR I HAVE USEDSCREWS THAT CAME WITH UNIT HADE TO BE CUT DOWN LUCKY I KNEW HOW TO CORRECT 
Fits tight in the bar end It comes with two different size inserts to fit different inside diameters Like others have stated the bolts are tight in the brass inserts READ THE DIRECTIONS  they clearly state that they are tight Just follow the directions and it all fits together very well The mirror is slightly convex  it is hard to notice it but it is not flat as others have stated Overall this is a good mirror for flat bars 
Good quality 


Works well enough for me I like it Only failing is its difficult to see very far behind due to the mirror being too curved and rather small So cars sometimes seem to come out of nowhere Installation was easy and it fits tight and well in 78th ID handlebar 
I like this mirror a lot It is fully adjustable in all angles Stays tight and has a real glass mirror that does not seem to be convex at all really Good field of view and is easy to find while I ridenot too low on handle bar 
This works really well and is relatively easy to install 
This is the second of this brand mirror which I have bought I put it on my girl friends bike They work great 
best mirror I have used 
Fits snugly It is a little weird putting it together and I wonder if it really has to be that tight You think youre gonna break it when you are tightening a couple of the bolts 
Perfect Easy mounting and adjustment 
Light weight and works Not much vibration to worry about 
The threads to screw the mirror housing together were misaligned and as soon as I applied the slightest amount of rotational force to screw the housing together the metal screw receptacle broke free from the plastic housing  unless junk 
Works well with multiple handle bar sizes solid construction 
Excellent mirror It is just slightly convex so you get a wide field of view and the images are displayed very close to reality Its also glass so the images are very clear I didnt use the cross piece as I wanted to keep the mirror closer to the bike It holds steady and after a month of daily riding it hasnt moved at all 
View is hard for me to see when riding Need to get used to it 
Makes riding in city traffic much safer Easy to install Easily adjusts to any position Stays where you put it when you ride 
Mirror is flat I gives a good field of view I bought this for my grand daughters bicycle Adjustment screws tighten nicely so the mirror will hold its position You may still adjust the mirror itselfit just stays put under the adjustable tension screws Not sure how it would stand up if ones bike falls down as this hasnt happened 
i would not use a mirror just turn your head or get a mirror for your helmet which will always be in your field of vision this took a second away from avoiding danger since it is so out of place 
Good mirror Just make certain you tighten everything down well  not TOO well or it will break plastic parts but definitely give it a good crank The best part Forget those silly dental mirrors for your helmet  this gives a GREAT view of whats behind you and doesnt take up any space on your handlebars so you can still mount all of your gadgets and toys 
Perfect 
You can adjust the view of the mirror as to have the best view possible Everything adjusts so you can place it just like you want it I use it all the time It will also fit a large variety of bikes due to the way it attaches to the bike When it gets dirty its hard to see out of but thats not the fault of the mirror Its nice to be able to see behind me without turning in my seat 
Initially it was a bit complex to figure out which part goes where but in 10 minutes I was able to assemble it I was really suspicious that it might be flimsy but no way Once I tightened the screws it became really stable It was heart warming the manual was saying no worries about breaking parts just tighten the screws Cause screws were very hard to tighten So after installation it really works well Those helmet mirrors never worked for me well and the middle bar mirrors are just useless to me cause I just see myself I am really not sure who invented the middle bar mirrors are they just to comb your hair when biking  Anyway this mirror goes to the side of the bar and gives me a good visibility of the back Great product So once again when I opened the package I was skeptical to return it immediately but man I am glad I didnt It works great 
Not easy to attach 
they work and are easily adjustable fits my Cannondale trail 29er 
I had two of these installed by the bike shop on my new Terratrike Tour II recumbent tadpole trike They are in a word amazing Ive had cycling mirrors mounted on bikes before but they always were loose difficult to get to stay adjusted and hard to really see anything out of These Mirrycle mirrors though are a completely different animal They somehow manage to stay in place while still being easy to adjust Once adjusted its fairly easy to see everything behind you I was going to have only one installed but for the price I couldnt resist having the second one put on Im glad I did Overall Im very happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone looking for a bicycle mirror 
These work great I fell and broke part of mine no fault of mirror bought 2 so I wont have to be with out 
the one i received had a defect however the seller refunded me 
Very nice mirror works great 
I wish I had invented this I have one and I ordered a second one  makes riding my California Cruiser on the road much safer Make sure you tighten all screws as per instructions and it will not move around unless you readjust it yourself 
Perfect price great delivery 
Sturdy mirror and very easy to install 
Ben Usein These For As Long As They Have Ben Made  Always Will  The Best Mirrors On The Planet  
Very easy to install Based on one of the reviews I read I installed it under downward and under the handlebar It looks much better that way and the mirror wont be the first point of contact 
best bike mirror ive ever had 
Good quality and easy to install 
This mirror was easily attached I did have to pierce the very end of my bikes hand grip I like the mirror because it can be configured several different positions Also can be used on either side of the handlebars Once the mirror is tightened in position it is very stable Even when riding trails there is very little movement in the reflection of the mirror Love it 
I have no complaints and am happy with this purchase When I put my bike away the mirror often gets moved so I just need to make sure to check it before heading out just like you should do with your car 
Works great and easy to install 
Fits fairly well but does not give you a decent range of vision behind you the biker 
Now I have a rear view mirror for my bike but I am going to take my bike to a bike shop so they can attach mirror correctly to the bike 
works great very helpful 
Made well and easy to adjust  stays where you adjust it too Clear image without vibration or bouncing problems Bought two for my tadpole trike 
Good mirror for bike or tadpole trike 
Made in USA Much higher quality than I expected Fit perfectly into the end of my oldschool MTB straight bar and stays put even over bumpy ground Overall Im very pleased with every aspect of the product Pay attention to the instructions theyll let you know that its OK for the screws to be quite tight going into the brass thread inserts I used a drop of light oil and all is well 
Works well and the only issue I had with this mirror was the tightness of the hardware I used a tap to clearance out the inserts but after reading the instructions after the fact its suppose to be that tight so it wont move my bad it still works but probably wont stay in place long term 
easy to install and lightweight 
this felt really cheap when i was putting it on the bike felt like all the screw were stripping also had to use my own tools wasnt super easy to mount but have to say it does the job and does not move around surprised how solid it is 
Over the last 15 years I have had these on every bike I have owned You can position it all sorts of ways I use it on road bikes tho supposedly it is for Mt Bikes 
Excellent Product and Service Will buy again 
My wife and I each have one on our bikes It works well doesnt shake or move  and most importantly gives us a clear view of whats behind us Easy install You just have to be brave enough to cut the end out of your handgripwhich was a little unnerving on a brand new bike 
Not bad Does what I need it to do Only minor complaint is that even when you torque down on the bolts its still prone to getting bumped out of place On the good side that makes it easy to adjust the mirror on the fly as youre riding So very minor issue 
Easy install Looks great Strong Definitely will buy again 
Very nice Better than those with flexible arms Recommended 
Works great on mountain bikes and hybrids For my road bike its hard to adjust it to get a full view and you have to move your head a little to get the 90 view behind you but still worth every penny Ive bought them for family and friends and they love them for their Hybridsmountain bikes Pretty durable kickstand failed a bunch of times and fell right on the mirror only cracked mirror once Ill always buy these whenever replacement is needed 
This is a replacement for one that someone broke off Ive tried all the mirrors including the ones that go on your helmet This is so great and so adjustable I can always see now when a vehicle is approaching behind me or another bike and also look and make sure my husband is somewhere in sight I was a first time snowbird this year and when I went to a bike dealer for an adjustment on my bike he said that this was the only worthwhile mirror to havemade me feel good about my choice 
Very sturdy I take the train and this has survived numerous assaults from other bikes 
Works quite well quality is good have not had to replace it yet and I believe Ive been using it for probably a year Nice price there thank you 
Works great Much better than other rear view bike mirrors I have tried Easy to install too 
This mirror works great Once installed which was very easy and adjusted it stays put Ive had others that moved around so this is much nicer 
Well designed and easy to install The mirror adjusts well and stays in place This is a very important safety device if you do not wear a helmet mirror 
These are such great mirrors a must if you ride I got two 
Ive bought a number of different bike mirrors and this is the only one that works Others wont stay pointed have too much or too little fish eye or vibrate way too much My bike fell over and broke the mirror and I found I couldnt hardly ride without it so I bought another Its not that fragile the bike fell over lots of times without breaking the mirror Even with a chance of breaking it its well worth it I commute and its about a necessity 

Great mirror would buy again in a heart beat 
I love these All my bikes have them and most of them are mounted up on top of my long bar ends If you have bar ends with inner diameter close to handlebar size that is a perfect place if there is a long enough straight section to slide the clamp into The mirror holds its adjustment but is also easy to change if needed the friction joints work perfectly The mirror has just the right amount of convex to it to give a nice field of view Best safety item you can add to a bike to keep track of traffic and riders behind you 
Very good 
Works great 
This mirror is good got it and put it together right out of the box really easy The directions and the diagram to put it togeher are simple like ikea Put it togther lightly then tightened it up after adjusting it but a word to the wise dont crank down on the screws just tighten about an 18th that give the mirror some movement for adjustment not too tight because then you wont be able to tweak it in and if it moves a little you can tweak it back into placebut make sure its not loose either because and movement such as a bump will throw the mirror out of alignment Remember lightly tighten it not crank it It seems strong but dont know how it will hold up if my bike falls over and there is a direct hit Hope i dont find outBut overall it seems really sturdy 
Works well but maybe a little fragile in construction Nonetheless it has held up for years without breaking Glad I bought if 

Ive been through many mirrors over the years There are two big problems with them first most will reorient themselves when you hit a big enough bump second it is not at all uncommon to simply have the mirror crash to the ground in the middle of a ride This mirror has a really solid mount is very adjustable and all the joints can be tightened so that the mirror doesnt bump out of adjustment 
Purchased for parts the previous one was damaged I like the product enough that I didnt change manufacturer 
This is a good barmounted mirror and I use it a lot especially when approaching a cross road to see if a vehicle wants to cut in front of me A safety tool as important as a helmet My second one You can buy replacement parts for it say if the mirror breaks 
Bought one for both bikes See very easily whats behind you 
EDIT After 5000 miles commuting on the Wisconsin frozen winter the plastic on the L elbow cracked off probably due to cold temperatures single digit F and below zero and vibrations of those amazingly well paved POS Wisconsin roads mirror flew off so good for casual riding in warmer weather but useless in the long run in cold just get a DOT approved mirror made out of metal a bit heavier but it will be dependable and plastic wont crack This is the 2nd mirror that this has happened to me hence why I am updating my review Original review Wish they had a wide angle portionsection in the mirror area other than that they work great Simple to install yet sturdy to withstand daily commutes 
Bought one of these for my 10 speed vintage Schwinn Now I have one for the mountain bike as well These are the best mirrors I purchased and Ive gone through half a dozen 
After buying two other brands of bike mirrors then having to throw them all away this one is the Holy Grail The biggest problem with all the others in my opinion is the fact that every time you hit a friggin bump you have to readjust the mirror Very bad But with this little gem the tightening screws are so firmly secured that once you adjust it the mirror STAYS PUT The secret is in the screw bolts they intentionally made them to fit extremely snugly into the holes making the holding power of this unit incredibly strong In fact had I not read the directions mentioning how hard you have to tighten them with the little wrench they provide you I would have thought that they were the wrong size and immediately returned the entire unit But thats exactly how they were designed to fit you wont break the plastic when you really bear down hard to tighten everything together In fact if you have weak hands you might want to enlist someone with a more powerful grip to do the entire job for you The results are totally worth it 
Falls iff 
A good sturdy mirror with a wide field of view Very adjustable Ive accidentally dropped my bike on its side a couple of times landing on the mirror and it hasnt broken These fit easily into the bar on my Trek DS 85 but they wont fit on my sons Trek FXs a 73 and 76 due to the IsoZone handlebars Check your bar ends to make sure your bar is a round tube Mirrycle makes a special order mirror for IsoZone notched bars 
Easy to mount well made and product as described Great value for price Have bought two more for kids bikes 
I have tried out several rear view mirrors on several bikes and this is by far the best My only wish is that they made 2 styles this one and the same design made with a chromeretro look I have some modern bikes and some retro ones and Ive ended up putting these on the retro cruisers cause theyre just so damn good but they ruin the look of the bike However they are so functionally awesome that I put up with that 
Have three of these Work great makes riding much safer 
Very functional mirror once positioned correctly Vertical position adjustability of the rear view could be much easier if mirror attachment to arm was a ball joint instead of 90deg rotate only 
Mounted easily fit and finish look great 
Great product Ive purchase these on a regular basis It is highly adjustable and is a quality product 
After trying almost every type of handlebar mirror I have found the best This is the first accessory I put on any new bike This mirror is easy to install and is the sturdiest on the market The design allows for numerous configurations to put the mirror in a location that will be easy to see 
Poor fit 
My son has dropped bars on his road bike and I insist that he ride with a mirror After looking at the various options I thought this mirror would work for his bike We mounted it the other day and took it for a test drive and it works perfectly What I like about this mirror is the way it fits solidly inside the bar There is a slip wedge that is similar to the old style handlebar stem wedge that tightens with an allen wrench supplied that really locks it down He was able to adjust it with no effort If youre doing road riding like we are you have to have a mirror This mirror is a really good one that is adaptable to almost every application 
Good 
works great 
These work sweet on my 3 wheeled trike and give me a good rear view look at a quick glance Excellent fitment 
I love this mirror It took a minute or three to assemble it but now that its on my bike I love it T says put doesnt move around or turn upside down on the handlebars and its big enough to see anything behind me Very happy with this purchase 
Works wellcan see behind methats what counts 

There should be a law to mount a side view mirror on every left handle bar My son is so much more safer now that he is using this He took an incredibly hard spill that surprisingly didnt crush his cheek bone when he attempted to look back to see what is behind him Helmets dont protect that area of the skull I use this on my mountain bike used for 30 mile street riding conditioning There are a few narrow high speed streets where this is critical to have It is easy to install is exceptionally well made and designed No cons 
very flexible good mirror a safety must 
working out great for me very happy 
Recently purchased this mirror for my bike that I use on my work commute I cant state just how much easier this has made my ride It was easy to install although it should be noted that you will have to cut into your handlebar ends to install it and is easy to adjust I no longer have to look over my shoulder to try and figure out whether I can shift lanes or merge Im not nearly as paranoid about whether or not trying to dodge debris in the shoulder of the road is going to get me killed and I dont have to worry about veering off course when I need to check traffic Definitely worth the money if you do a lot of commuting or just like to ride on the road 
Nice mirrors and they look and work good 
I cannot believe that this product has not shattered into a million pieces Ive been knocked off my bike and land right on the mirror side of the handlebars and it survived multiple impacts of this nature This mirror survived A impact from a large SUV at a good rate of speed Other than tightening up one screw every other month If this can fit your bicycle this is one 
a 
great price works great 
This is a great product The materials are durable and the design is good 
The Mirrycle MTB Bar End Mountain Bicycle Mirror is the bike mirror Ive been looking for Its fully adjustable it comes with easy to understand installation instructions that make it easy to install its lightweight and its built with quality materials This mirror is designed to resist breakage and I can testify to the fact that it takes more than a couple pretty nasty spills to break the mirror or the sectional mounting arms And should you survive a crash that the mirror doesnt Mirrycle includes a parts replacement list that makes it easy to order very reasonably priced parts Ive used a couple different helmet mirrors and a mirror that attaches to eyeglass frames but this one has them all beat Finally with this little beauty attached to your handlebar youll be able to clearly see any rear approaching threat 
Fairly easy to install looks kinda clunky but it does what its supposed to do 
Best Mirror Ive yet to find This purchase followed my buying a mirror from a local bike shop for 26 The mirror had fallen off and broken twice under warranty This one is easy to install and much more secure I cant understand how companies sell poorly designed mirrors but it certainly highlights when theyre made well like this one 
Pretty simple product What could go wrong Had zero problems or issues 
Helps a little Beats trying to turn my head around 
I just received these new mirrors and so far I seem to be very impressed with them they certainly seem to be of better quality than anything else that I had to date 
Mounted on my barend handles Really work well and adjust with ease Good quality and good price 
Totally stable Perfect I mounted it facing downward and inward I also attached the mirror portion itself so the outer edge is in line with the downward arm or if you mount it sticking up the arm that sticks up The attachment point on the back of the mirror is off center so it allows this option I like the very tight threads because it makes it so stable See other review on tip for avoiding crossthreading Convexity is just enough to be very useful without distortion 
A great product 
Does just what I need I am much safer using this for my bike rides in the street 
Highly recommend 
WORKS AS EXPECTED 
I have several of these For me this is the best mirror on the market It attaches to your handlebars easily and adjusts any way you need it Buy it Youll probably buy more if you have more than one bike 
Get this thing Its fantastic Now I can finally see whats behind when Im riding without turning my head around to look back Keeps you safer on the road no brainer to buy it 
Those the job very well 
Assembling this was a bit of a challenge because the screw wouldnt go in as far as it should have I didnt want to force it and I was going to send it back but then decided to put a spot of olive oil in it Lubing it up loosened it enough to make it work Its a good sized mirror with a good view and you can adjust it at any angle youd like I like it much better than the other two mirrors Ive tried and will likely buy one for each handle bar as I most often ride on roads with cars I should mention that my husband doesnt like it  for him its too big too conspicuous and bordering dorky I dont mind dorky if it makes me safer 
This is a great mirror that hooked up to my bike very easily 
Well built and great safety addition for urban riding 
This is so handy to have when riding on the road It was pretty easy to install though I am mechanically inclined I will purchase another for my mothers bike too 
Does the job Debated on getting this unit or a different unit that hung under the handlebars Notice this unit when maneuvering my bike out of my apartment mirror hits door frames not a big deal 
Very satisfied with the quality and safety improvement it provides Easy to set up Im thinking to buy another one for the other side of the handlebarnbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefMirrycleMTBBarEndMountainBicycleMirrordpB0009R96YKrefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTF8Mirrycle MTB Bar End Mountain Bicycle Mirrora 
This mirror works incredibly well and is very stable 
Installed in a breeze and really made riding around town with kids in tow a lot less stressful 
Fantastic Once installed it can be adjusted to be up down in or out Tighten it up and then back off on the screws just a tad it will be tight but will fold if the bike falls saving the mirror Down and in works as well watch your knee doesnt hit it while peddling in this position though Its extremely well bell well designed and versatile I wouldnt touch another mirror at this point why not stick with the best 
Nice Much better than CatEye Once you place it into the position you want it tightens up nicely Good value 
Easy to install I feel saver now and see my wife in the back 
keeps me from getting run over by the road bikers 
Pros The mirror is not made out of plastic like some others this one is made of glass Easy to adjust after installation Cons Packaging of this wasnt so great could have easily broken the glass if someone decides to drop it on the group It would be nicer if the mirror had a wider angle view 
The best cycling mirror of its kind Replacement parts readily available I liked them so much I have them on 4 bikes I own 
Does a great job on our bicycles 
Best MTBATB bike mirror ever Accept no substitutes This thing attaches to the end of the bar with some opposing wedgeshaped pieces with a long sockethead bolt going through them and a barrel nut squeezing them together As the screw gets tightened the wedge pieces expand out towards the tube walls on the handlebars This creates an anchor 23 inches or so into the end of the handle Once its in this thing is not moving until you loosen the bolt Assembly and attachment is very easy and takes only minutes Everything you need to attach this onto your handlebars is included but you will need a utility knife to cut a hole in any rubberplastic grips you have Includes both a larger and smaller wedge piece to accommodate different sized bars Highquality build and finish As good as a car mirror 
The slightest jarring on the scooter knocks this thing out of whack so you have to constantly reset it 
Works as well as could be expected  while going over bumps changing sitting position etcyou change the angle and what youll see in the mirror So Ive got mine set to view behind me while Im in my most common position The mirror was easy to install and took just a few minutes I think it is built well enough but it certainly isnt intended to survive lots of drops and collisions with pavement It is easy to adjust and it generally holds its position once set tree branches or big bumps can mean I need to occasionally readjust But I really find it handy and it helps me keep an eye on cars when crossing roads as some car drivers seem to find bike riders invisible 
Big enough to see the road but small enough to dont fold it after ride Good design metal parts 
Bought two one for my bike  my wifes Work great 
the best 
Fantastic  I Love it Buying another for my other bike 
Great product Safe to buy 
This mirror is a well engineered product It attached perfectly to my handlebar The mirror has just the right amount of curvature to see the view I need to see It has never loosened I installed it exactly as instructions said 
Ordered this for our Day 6 bike Had to trim the end cap off the rubber handlebar grip with a razor blade Mirror mounted into handlebar perfectly 
I use this on a Recumbent Works great and I like being able to replace the mirror if needed 
Very easy to install and it works great Very useful and very clear mirror This product is excellent 
Works great I would buy again 
These mirrors are great but I have to keep the allen wrench handy to loosen the mirror and fold it in after each ride so I dont hurt the mirror or wall when I park my bike 
I love this mirror Im on my second one and wouldnt commute without one I dropped the bike and broke the first one and did the same with the replacement and cracked it but its still functional and hardly the mirrors fault that I am clumsy and dont have a kickstand Tighten it well or bumps can reposition it 
It works More specifically its design allows it to be mounted multiple ways which makes it easier to put the mirror right where you want it In general make sure you put a mirror on your bike if you are riding in traffic even more so if you commute It allows you to see exactly what is going on behind you so you can compensate if a car starts getting a little close 
This mirror mounts nicely on my MTB I like the design but the hardware is zinc coated steel The manufacturer could make it a better accessory by providing stainless steel hardware which is the standard on quality MTB accessories 
Was easy to install on my bike I usually have to adjust the mirror before biking though because it gets moved around rather easily 
Its too small and flimsy It takes far longer trying to sight vehicles in the mirror than to simply turn ones head It can not be uninstalled without removing the grip and if the grip is a slide type without clamps the grip has to be cut away I got rid of it because of 1 its lack of utility for me and 2 it adds enough to the width of the bicycle to make bringing the bike through doorways a pain If I try again to have a rear view mirror itll be a motorcycle style mirror clamping to the handlebar between the gripsshiftersetc 
Easy to install on wifes bike she loves it 
I didnt realize it was for a mountain bike so it did not work on my cruiser bike handle I used it instead for a different application minus the long plastic arm The mirror quality is good One of the bolts would not fit into the long plastic mount due to slight cracking of the inside of the metal bolt holder 

Easy to install Love it 
I have come to rely on these Mirrycle bar end mirrors The adjust well and give a great view of whats approaching from the rear Four rather than five stars because the upright post has failed on me several times it splits and I have to buy a replacement 
Great mirror for flat bars 
Mirror does what it is supposed to do but the screw threads are very tight and feel like they are being crossthreaded Was afraid I was going to break something while putting it together Not what I remember for quality from another Mirrcycle that I bought several years ago 
Neither of the two mirrors I got had the correct screws to install them The mirror looked okay but could not be installed without correct fasteners 
Great mirror I bought more for the other bikes Easy to adjust wide angle of view and very stable Perfect 
Not the easiest thing to set up and in install but for the price it works well Swivels nicely 
This is the perfect mirror It is extremely adjustable I accidentally bought 2 of these Im holding on to the 2nd one in case the first one breaks I have a feeling it will never break It is very durable 
yes this is the best mirror A bit of assembly required but great size and shape otherwise Many different configurations and angles to suit your bike For a road bike I like the other design called the Mirrycle Road mirror but that one only fits older shimano hoods This is great for mtn bikes and hybrids Although i did use it on my drop bars road bike a few times as suggested by another posted review Its a little low for my preference on drop bars but absolutely works 5 stars and i hope they never stop making this mirror 
Love it Moved it from my MTB to my drop bar road bike 
The best mirror I have had yet Very easy to install and very sturdy 
Better than anything else Ive tried 
This clever little mirror is easy to install and easy to adjust The large and slightly convex mirror gives plenty of visibility to the rear 
I use this on my road bike and am very happy I have tried 6 mirrors This doesnt have distortion and can find a spot down low and to the left that my left arm doesnt block the view of the mirror I rarely have to readjust it during the ride If I do it is usually that I bumped dismounting Maybe every 5th ride I hit such an extreme bump that it needs to be realigned 
Very Well made works great It does have a bit of that Fish Eye lens which really help your rear view Holds its settings fine 
This thing is all plastic The paint is sub par with little cake build here and there Be sure to go slow putting it together I broke a hex on it It is designed so the screws are hard to put in I used a vice and a longer hex to get it together Once together its stays in place where you put it Ill buy it again because I like the mirror It is lite weight I cant justify the cost though but Ill buy it again because its the only cost effective choice and its round If it says bike on it its expensive Update on my last review I bought some butterfly handle bars and I used this to hold the mirror in place Works greatnbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefUniversalBikeBicycleLEDLightFlashlightTorchLampMountClampStandHolderdpB00HMY3YNCrefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTF8Universal Bike Bicycle LED Light Flashlight Torch Lamp Mount Clamp Stand HolderanbspAnd by the way I hate misinformation to the guy that says tap your handlebars with a hammer and magically create a spot for this mirror yeah bud youre wrong 
Works great Much less expensive than the one I paid for at the bike shop 
Nice mirror for hybrid bikes Im planning on getting a second one for the right side 
Easy to install and works great Easy to see behind me from any position 
hit a branch with it and the glass broke I would spend a lot of time adjusting it and in the end it was just easier and more reliable to look back vs use this mirror 
Have used this mirror for about a month It does not shake loose or move a real benefit on a hybrid I like the multiple positions available and adapters to any size tube Real glass mirror Oh yes and light enough and since I swung it below the handle bars the angle presents little wind resistance 
This is the first mirror that Ive ever had on one of my bicycles I thought that it would get in the way but it really doesnt and it makes riding so much easier and more enjoyable I wish I would have gotten these a long time ago I am going to order two more one for my wife and son 
Excellent field of view I just bought another one for a second bike 
Cannot live without it Sturdy 
Comes in many pieces 
The Mirrycle mirror is a mixed bag for me The mounting system and adjustment pivots are top notch its an easy to use design and very tolerant of abuse However Im not a fan of the mirror itself the field of view is too small for me My advice is buy the Cateye MTB mirror which has an excellent slightly wideangle oval shaped mirror and glue it to the Mirrycle That way you get the best mirror and the best mounting system in one Happy riding 
I have these mirrors on all 5 of my bikes and they work great 
I love these mirrors Its made such a difference I feel so much more confident now and I dont have to turn my head which often ends up turning the entire bike to see whats coming behind me I thought I needed some but these have made an even bigger impact than I thought 

I have liked having this mirror it is very adjustable it is sturdy and it is durable The instructions are not the best but are not horrible either it took about 5 minutes to install 
Love this product Broke it mountain biking Dont ask Bought another Relove it 
We love this mirror Its not real big but just big enough to see behind us I got one for each bike 
Excellent I love it 
Not great quality and too wide for bicycle 
This mirror is rocksolid on my bike Set it once and it stays where you want it An excellent product for those of us who ride in traffic 
Not a bad mirror A little vibration on more gravely paved roads but just hold your finger against it when you need a better view on those roads Not as convex as a blind spot mirror so it gives good range of rear view 
I will survive the city streets with this Easy adjustable to different streets Clear clear clear I looked at mirrors for days to find it this was the best 
Great addition to the bike and easily mounts to the end of the handlebar 
Works great 
This is a great mirror It is big enough I can see behind me and I adjust it easily while biking if I need to My bike has a kickstand problem and it has fallen over on the mirror side several times but the mirror is tough enough that it hasnt broken 
I ride a Sun Recumbent Trike and needed to be able to see what was coming up behind me This solved the problem nicely My handle bars are mounted under the seat I had no issues mounting the mirror It took all of 5 minutes 
This mirror is great I got it for my electric bike and I cant imagine riding without a mirror now The mirror articulate to allow it to be installed in many different configurations It can also be adjusted on the fly I ride through a narrow tunnel and turn it inside my handlebars so it doesnt collide with anything and open up again after I get out Doing this is also great for storing your bike inside small places The bolts feel tight when youre installing it but Ive read this is a future to prevent it from vibrating loose it hasnt for me yet Overall great value and safety for the price 
Simple to install and big rear view 
Perfect size Bends to any desired angle and tightens so there are no vibrations Easy install with great results 
Pretty much a perfect product 
Great mirror Can be tightened just enough to make it adjustable without any tools Good rear vision day or night 
Love these mirrors Have been using for several years and will continue to use Just dont drop your bicycle I did and had to get a new one 
Ive purchased several of these mirrors some seem to be fine but a couple of them must have been defective The stem that has the threaded nut inside cracks when trying to mount the mirror to the stem and the round not inside breaks in half This is not cause by tightening it too much but seems to be a problem with the threads I should request a return authorization but dont want to go to the trouble This is the 3rd one Ive had a problem with 
This was a challenge to mount but its done and very neatlymy way not per the instructions Worth the time and effort glad I got one Thanks 
I found itto be sturdy and well made I was a bit concerned when I started to put it togrther and found that the screws were a tight fit into thr receiver A bit of WD40 solved that problem It it a good product 
it works beautifully I could see clearly when people approach me and let them pass safely Would recommended 
Great product for a good price alot cheeper than from the local bike shops 
High quality mirror that stays in place Easily adjustable Recommended 
The Pros  Does what it is supposed to  Glass so it shouldnt scratch easily  Fairly easy to assemble and mount  Does not look terrible  Lightweight The Cons  Instructions could be better First off I am VERY glad I bought this I feel much safer riding this mirror gives me a great view of what is behind me without constantly having to look over my shoulder It actually works better than I expected but to be honest for the price I did not expect much so I was pleasantly surprised Which is always nice What you should know As much as I like it you should know that the instructions are not very good and when assembling it it felt like it was going to break The screws dont seem to be a very good fit Dont get me wrong they do fit it does end up okay but it was VERY hard to tighten and it kept feeling like it was going to crack or break while putting it together The instructions were not very clear but I figured it out Once installed it seems great I have only had it on for about a week or so but so far no complaints and I am very happy with this purchase PS Some people said they had to mutilate their handles to get it on That was NOT the case for me I have a Trek mountain bike and the end of the handle had a plastic cap I was able to remove very easily and the mirror mount fit in perfectly and tightened on perfectly I guess it depends on the bike but this seemed to be built perfectly for me Trek 
Absolutely love this mirror  so easy to install and works like a charm  not only can i see my son riding on the trailer bike behind me but also my daughter and my wife on their bikes 20 to 30 feet behind me I am recommending this to anyone seriously riding on bike trails and streets 
works great easy to install 
works well very cheap feeling 
I tried a helmet mirror was really annoying and would block my sight a little This is easy to install but it does pivot pretty easily if brushed against something I can see clearly behind me now 

The plastic is of very low quality I mounted the mirror and rode my bike to the store When I got there I noticed the mirror had moved out of position I thought maybe I hadnt tightened it enough but when I took a closer look I could see the plastic had cracked all the way through the support arm I let the 4 12 star review trick me  This is a very low quality product 
Brings an ease to riding by clearly showing what is happening behind me Very well made Takes a little time adjusting and tightening hex nuts but then stays in place even on bumpy roads Ive had several mirrors in the past and this is the best Have on my city mtn and road bikes 
Ill never ride a bike without a mirror again I have 3 of these 
I have this mirror on three bikes Replacement mirrors are inexpensive 
Thought it was garbage until I put it together and used it Seems very durable Im not a hardcore cyclist but I do listen to headphones when I pedal Now I know when cars are behind me and it makes me feel a little safer Installed on Trek mountain bike  had to cut off the tip of my grips  had to remove the plastic plugcap from the end of the handle bar tubing  the mirror installed very easily Glad I got this 
This mirror is perfect for my hybrid After a few weeks on very bumpy roads the screws need occasional tightening but for the most part it is sturdy I dont like riding without it I love being able to see behind me 
Ive had experience with these on a recumbent trike so when I got a new fat bike this was something I immediately missed so I ordered a set and installed them and I can safely ride without constantly looking over my shoulder once again If you have grips with plugs in the end then you just pop out the plugs and slide the mirrors in otherwise you will have to cut the end out of your grips but once you slide these in you will never know you had to cut your grips I believe that if your riding on the road you should have a mirror of some kind and these should work for just about anyone 
excellent mirror 
Easy to install Other reviewers made me apprehensive but I managed with no problem If my bike gets knocked over Im sure the mirror will break but Im careful I love seeing whats behind me without having to turn around 
If you want a bike mirror look no furtherseriously Its well made solid and holds its position while riding over paved roads and rough terrain alike I just dont understand the people that write that it moves around as they ride The field of view is perfect for the size and gives the rider all the info you need at a glance Its multi adjustments assures a perfect POV for all size riders When you assemble it prior to installing it on your bike youll notice the brass threads that you screw the Allen bolts into The brass is a softer metal and makes for a tighter fitso as you assemble the mirror dont be discouraged as to how hard it is to screw the bolts into the threadsits meant to be like that It comes with the Allen wrench so you can leave it in your seat bag if you need it The only time I loosen it up is to turn the bike upside down to adjust something or fix a tire For the money I cant see why anyone would buy a different brand of mirror If you dont hit it on something or drop your bike this mirror will last 20 years no problem 
As far as Im concerned if you ride in the road and you dont have a rearview mirror youre asking to get run over Those helmet mirrors might be good for some people but I dont think you can beat a well placed handlebar mounted mirror This thing has enough options for placement and adjustability that Im sure it would work well on a lot of different types of bikes I had mine on a Trek 800 mountain bike You know how when you look over your shoulder to the left your shoulders naturally follow Well that can lead to you pulling your bike to the left and possibly losing control in the middle of the road Its happened to me and Ive almost been hit because of it Stay aware and stay safe Keep your rubber on the road 
This is THE answer 
Very solid construction Instructions are great and even tell you that its going to be tight and dont worry because you wont break it Mirror does exactly what you would expect and is very solid Love it Wasnt super happy about cutting my brand new handlebar grips but it was worth it 

I almost returned this product because the screws were very difficult to get in and I didnt want to strip the barrel but its a nice mirror Also the wedge is a great idea but takes some figuring out and the instructions suck That aside once its on your bike its easily adjustable and a high quality glass so you can see very well It doesnt really work for road bikes though because when you have the mirror that low since your handlebars bend down you can barely see 
I wanted a mirror but I wanted to keep it small and this fills that need nicely The mirror is convex so it shows a fairly large area behind and yet its not too strongly curved so the things I want to see are big enough to recognize It arrived in a very small box because its completely disassembled but it was quick and easy to assemble and to mount very securely on the end of my handlebar There are really only two small issues that keep me from giving it 5 stars Its nearly impossible to adjust the mirror while ridingthere are cap screws holding everything tightso it took some trial and error to find the best position And because its small and right on the end of the handlebar it took some experimenting to find a position that wouldnt show my a lot of my forearm at the expense of overtaking vehicles But knowing what I know now Id gladly buy it again
